Now that SC has ruled that all citizens of India who file IT returns HAVE to furnish Aadhaar card at the time of filing, here is the plan of action (formulated after discussing with a senior lawyer of the Supreme Court)

1. For each tax payer in your family, get a new SIM card (give Address proof as ration card and ID proof as Postal ID card)
2. Get a cheap Nokia mobile for around Rs. 1,000 and insert this new SIM.
3. Take appointment at nearest Aadhaar enrollment center
4. For the appointment, go with your documents: Ration card and Postal ID card
5. Keep a soft copy of [Sep 26, 2018 order of SC](https://www.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2012/35071/35071_2012_Judgement_26-Sep-2018.pdf) on your smartphone

Answers for questions that you are most likely to be asked

Question | Answer
-|-
What is your bank account number? | I do not have to give that to you. Here is a copy of the SC order dated Sep 26, 2018
What is your LPG ID? | We use an electric cooker at home
What is your mobile number? | Give the new SIM number in your basic Nokia mobile
Your Address proof, ID proof? | Give ration card and Postal ID card

#PS:

1. When you go to take a new SIM card, in the CAF form, they will ask you to fill PAN. DO NOT provide PAN in the form to get a SIM card.
2. How to get Postal ID card (same procedure all over India): http://www.tamilnadupost.nic.in/psvc/adproof.htm . First try to get the postal ID card at your local post office. If they are not helpful, be mentally prepared to go to the office of the Postmaster General in your city.

My reasons for doing so is such:

1. When there are more film industries, the number of artists, videographers, dance choreographers, etc will also multiply in number. More people get jobs and wealth won't just center around a few people, who are calling all the shots in the industry at the moment. 
2. There will certainly be more diversity in the kind of films that are produced. Places like UP and Bihar don't have the same taste in film as people who live in Mumbai or Delhi. 
3. One problem with Bollywood is that it doesn't relate to the average person living in the Hindi belt. This addresses that particular problem. Points 4 &amp; 5 elaborates more on this.
4. Once films become more regional, they will get worse in quality, but people shouldn't be concerned about that. In the case of South India, people have often criticized that the movies have dumbed down over the decades; meaning that last time, the films were more classy with complex storylines but now they're more violent with simple storylines. What they forget is that last time, it was only the educated upper caste/class who had money to go to the cinema and watch movies. Now, almost every man in South India could purchase a movie ticket and so a massive democratization process has happened. 
5. Regional govts and locals can use these regional films to understand their societies better. When violence is portrayed in a South Indian movie, that's exactly how the gangsters in the South behave so there's a lot of truth in these movies. But in Bollywood, you have fights between light-skinned actors with full make-up on and nice clothes, and the scene is somewhere in Europe. Another example, rape that's portrayed in Southern movies looks as heinous as how it happens in real life. Can Bollywood dare to show it in that level of brutality? They can't because otherwise the urban middle-class of Mumbai and Delhi won't buy the tickets. They'll powder it up and as a result, the truth doesn't get exposed.

Due to its huge size, natural beauty, rich historical and cultural heritages India attracts millions of foreign tourists each year. However, the condition of tourism industry is pathetic in India. If we could solve some of the basic problems, India could attract a lot more international tourists.

It's a US$210 billion industry which supports 42 million jobs. For comparison our IT industry size is US$150 billion with 4 million jobs.

India receives about 15 million foreign tourists each year while Malaysia and Hong Kong receives 27 millions each. China gets 60 millions and its controlled zones Hong Kong gets 28 mil and Macau 17 mil. So, we need to better to attract a lot more foreign tourists.

There should be special tourist zones (STZ) for better investments in infrastructures, communication systems and law and order.

We need to keep the tourist places safer for the tourists, especially for the women tourists. Special security forces for the tourist spots are required. Also, they need to use modern security and surveillance systems for better efficiency.

The culture of scamming and cheating foreigners need to go. Strict actions were necessary against those cheaters.

The services like rented cars, restaurants, shops etc should be kept under strict vigilance in tourist zones.

The security forces should also check the misbehaving tourists too. We don't need assholes to destroy our national heritages and local culture.

There are many places in India with amazing tourism possibilities. Developing these regions could attract more tourists.

To add to the woes, the general elections will happen for the large part of April and May. At the peak of summer. And as we all know, owing to the elections, the elected representatives at central and state level will become full time campaigners and the local administration will get busy managing their events.

Governance is set to take a serious hit.

It is only a matter of time that the crops and cattle will start dying. Water mafia will go rampant. Marginalised groups will be overlooked. Fights will erupt over first access to water. Industrial production will go down due to short supply of water. The decline in ground water levels will fast accelerate. Water scarcity will lead to food scarcity.

A national crisis is about to take place.

Clearly, the election commission didn’t care.

But, would this be an election issue?

Would the media give spotlight to the sharded lands, the parched lakes, the dying livestock and the thirsty hapless people of digital India?

Would urban Indians even care?

To add a perspective, 600 million Indians live in areas of high to extreme water stress.

I know people who earn 50k+ a month and have income certificates saying 'farmer - 11000 per annum'. (Which I am surprised isn't a dead give away.)

But my problem isn't that people will fake their income, screw that. My problem is, that just for the greed of votes, we have seen almost everyone voting to pass this bill in the loksabha.

The Haryana Government is [planning to amend](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/haryana-bill-seeks-to-end-protection-to-aravalis-in-gurugram/articleshow/68000393.cms?) **the Punjab Land Preservation Act**, **1900** in its upcoming Budget Session starting tomorrow, 20th February. If the amendment is passed in the Legislative Assembly, around [900 hectares](https://realty.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/haryana-likely-to-leave-900-hectares-of-aravali-foothills-out-of-protected-area/67910749) **of Aravali foothills in Delhi NCR (Gurgaon and Faridabad)** \- classified as **Natural Conservation Zone (NCZ) -** will be open to **Private Real Estate Ownership**.

The Supreme Court of India, in the past, has passed several orders to safeguard the Aravalis and has criticized illegal encroachments in the region. **Amending the PLPA will give a 'post facto' approval to the existing encroachments**.

A few months back, thousands of residents [successfully](https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/to-save-aravalli-biodiversity-park-nhai-now-looks-for-alternative-route/story-7m1ZTcHlY5NXQY1oObukBI.html) protested against the proposal of the [the passage of an NHAI road](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/thousands-gather-to-protest-nhais-road-plan-in-aravali-biodiversity-park/articleshow/66407137.cms) through the Aravali Biodiversity Park (BDP). It's time, once again, that we stand united to stop any such activity that **benefits the wealthy and powerful real estate developers at the cost of environment**.

Please raise your voice to Save Aravali. Talk about it on Social Media.

Over a period of time if the largest denomination you can hold is 100 rupees this makes utilizing cash extremely cumbersome and would boost electronic and digital modes of payment.

For all the arguments of storing assets in Real Estate, Gold, Diamonds and other assets, I realize this isn't a complete fix. Just part of a very long term plan to slowly bring it down across the board as I'm sure that at some point even these assets need to be converted to legitimate forms of tender to actually trade them.

Tamil Nadu, which, unlike Kerala, did not have initial advantages over Gujarat, outperforms the latter on nearly every development indicator at the level of indicators as well as in the rate of change. This is despite Gujarat having a slightly higher economic growth rate. Tamil Nadu’s relative success is the result of state intervention in providing essential public services.

So before it was kind of like the sites were having stakes in/owned by seller and they made e-commerce very reliable than any local shop seller(where I come from). Just so you know "" ONLY India(few exceptions) got the Pay on delivery service for almost all items(except the costly ones) in the world. 

The middle man in the case of farmers and ecommerce sites is almost same as he will be the one to set the price(its exactly same if you consider amazon basics products). Most local seller will try to cut deals with international sellers which I am sure very less number of sellers from outside India will be interested in. They will try to keep competitive price but it will never be as good as cloudtail or WSRetail.
**It will be just like Downshipping by Local sellers**

**Sort of a solution**: I hope we will get to see companies as sellers for some made in India and other items. China shopping sites are other reliable option if you add paid international shipping to it. They also have priority lines in India now (which is much better than slow India post). I don't have a solution for branded items or customs tax but I hope flipkart and amazon does. Maybe this fiasco will end after the elections. It will be better if people start looking for more options than just indian e-commerce sites.

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers &amp; sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love.

1552275567,india,Avinash_Sharma,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azoh6g/suddenly_one_nation_one_policy_sentiment_is/,3,6,,,"Suddenly, ‘one nation, one policy’ sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman","You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

&gt;Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

&gt;Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

&gt;Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

&gt;As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

&gt;G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

&gt;The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

&gt;The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

&gt;They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

&gt;We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

&gt;Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

&gt;The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

&gt;Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

&gt;In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

&gt;You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

&gt;For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

&gt;There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

&gt;There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

&gt;The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

&gt;The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

&gt;Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

&gt;There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

&gt;That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

&gt;There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

&gt;The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

&gt;The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

&gt;Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

&gt;The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

&gt;This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

&gt;It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

&gt;Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

&gt;The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

&gt;Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

&gt;There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

&gt;All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

&gt;The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

&gt;Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

&gt;Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

&gt;If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

&gt;But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

&gt;There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

&gt;That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

&gt;That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

&gt;What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

&gt;There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

&gt;You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

&gt;No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

For some reason, they are now insisting on bank statements as well as credit card statements from that year. But such old statements don't seem to be available in HDFC's online systems and branch isn't of much help there. IT hasn't even mentioned the credit card number except that it was hdfc's.

So how do I tackle this? 

I have already told.thr IT department that the source was my salary (which it genuinely must be) and it isn't possible to get bank statements from 8 years back (HDFC only does statements for last 5 years). I asked what exactly are they looking for and I will be happy to explain. 

In response, they sent me a email with a threatening notice as attachment saying that unless I provide the statements in two days, further action will be taken.

Is this even legal to ask for details over a credit card payment over 8 years back? To me, this seems to be like a roving query that has been made because modi govt is seriously behind tax collections.

Why? Because most disinvestment was done as shares buyback, huge dividend payouts and buyouts by other PSUs

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain:

1. Shares Buyback: Basically the PSUs gave money to the govt with very little change in the ownership. It doesnt really accomplish anything. Doesnt encourage private players participation, govt ownership ratio doesnt change drastically, nor increase board transparency. If anything it only worsens because it reduces the money the PSU could have re-invested for business growth or create more job opportunities.
2. Huge Dividend Payouts: The dividends are paid out to every shareholder but majority shares are owned by govt. Again, same reasons as above. There is no real disinvestment here, this was just wacky accounting.
3. Buyout by other PSUs : For example, sale of HPCL to ONGC. Although this wass claimed as a vertical merger, this was not a real merger as HPCL still has its own board and trades separately. Worse even, as HPCL doesn't even recognize ONGC as the promoter and refuses to give it the representation. Again, basically this is a money loot from ONGC and it achieves nothing. I would have liked to see HPCL completely absorbed into ONGC for any benefits of merger, but this dint happen. More transactions like this happened also - Dredging Corp of India and recent PFC-REC buyout.

&amp;#x200B;

Good disinvestments:

1. I think the CPSE ETF tranches and Bharat 22 ETFs were well received.
2. Also, decent # of PSUs were listed on exchanges with some shares: RITES, HUDCO, HAL etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Acceptable:

1. SBI merger with 5 sub banks.
2. IDBI-LIC cash infusion
3. BoB, Dena, Vijaya Bank Merger  


Failures:

1. Air India
2. Pawan Hans
3. Scooters India Limited

&amp;#x200B;

I can only guess that they were scared about public / unions / employees backlash if it was aggressive. But for someone who came in with a huge mandate and seats (probably a rare opportunity in India) they failed to do any meaningful disinvestment. And, whatever they did, it only harmed more as it reduced the PSUs ability to hire and invest more.

&amp;#x200B;

As we had [posted before](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a92n0h/india_must_resist_the_lure_of_the_chinese_model/) the Ministry of IT was considering changes to the IT Intermediary Guidelines Rules, 2011. These changes were being considered in secret with social media companies and after [the Indian Express did a front page story](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/it-act-amendments-data-privacy-freedom-of-speech-fb-twitter-5506572/) and [we released](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/) the entire text of these rules, a [public consultation](http://meity.gov.in/comments-invited-draft-intermediary-rules) on it was announced.

These changes will harm all of us who use the internet. They will break end-to-end encryption, make indefinite data retention possible and will also require pro-active censorship by algorithms on platforms.  Please do [read our analysis here](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/).

Tomorrow the Ministry of IT is doing two things. It has first invited a select group of people for consultation on these rules. This will be attended by our executive director [Apar Gupta](https://twitter.com/apargupta84) and IFF Chairperson [Raman Chima](https://twitter.com/tame_wildcard). We will update you on what happens there.

The second thing it will be doing is that Ministry officials will conduct a [twitter Q&amp;A](https://twitter.com/GoI_MeitY/status/1081071055366701057) with the hashtag #SaferSocialMedia between 4-5 PM. Close to this Q&amp;A we will be tweeting model questions from [our twitter handle](https://twitter.com/internetfreedom) around that time. In addition to using the IT ministry's hashtag #SaferSocialMedia we will also be using #SaveOurPrivacy.

We request and call on all redditors to participate. For privacy and free speech!

https://i.redd.it/p575s4xxxpc21.png

Greetings from a cold, sunlit Delhi. Today, most of the roads around India Gate are blocked as we welcomed a row of tableaus for the Republic Day parade. It gives all Indians a chance to take pride in the progress we have made. This includes our growing leadership in information technology. But, even as we celebrate, concerns linger on an uncertain future. At present large swathes of online commentary are pessimistic in an ongoing wave of a ""tech lash"". This comes with good reason with growing threats to our liberties and rights from large platforms and government.

In 2019, IFF views it’s mission seriously but with a sense of optimism. Over the past month, we have taken actions and made considerable progress to ensure our constitutional promises with technology -- of liberty, justice, fraternity and equality --  are realised. This is possible with the continuing generosity and affection we have received from a growing community of supporters.

## More donors and volunteers are joining us!

I am pleased to first note that more individuals continue to donate to us. Going from 6 donors in October 2018 we scaled to 45 individual donations in December 2018. This month we have touched 36 donors. Such grassroots support helps us grow in strength and capacity as we accelerate our work. It brings me great joy as I have noticed many people are donating every month. To ease friction, we will soon be rolling out an informal membership option where you can support our work with the option for a recurring contribution.  While the total pool still does not match our needs, each donation is a source of pride. We need more donors and more help and I am confident we will be able to meet our financial goals to hire staff and build capacity to fight off threats.

As many of you have signed up to volunteer, we would like to update you on our continuing efforts to enable internet users to defend digital rights. We are building civic capacity by efforts to form a community who share a passion for digital rights. To open up our work for engagement and review we are experimenting with a Slack group where we help curate conversations and discuss projects. Volunteers from the fields of technology, policy and parliamentary experts, litigators and academics are working in different workgroups and executing projects to a high degree of skill and expertise. Our engagement on social media and the community on Reddit has been an ongoing conversation of support and learning.

Every day more people offer IFF help. They send a kind note, make a donation, offer their time, even demand we do better \[*correct our typos :D\]*.

## We have been busy!

Over the [**past month**](https://internetfreedom.in/), we have taken a range of actions on the core domains that are part of IFF's mandate.

* **Privacy:** On January 14, [**IFF**](http://internetfreedom.in/) went to the Supreme Court challenging the digital surveillance powers that enabled the MHA Notification authorising 10 agencies to collect your personal data. We argued the system right now lacks any checks and balances. This is worrying as the government can collect and requisition our data arbitrarily. An important part of our petition is the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. In our case, we have cited the fact that more than 11,000 people and 32 organisations support surveillance reform in India. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear our case and issued notice to the Government. Earlier in the month we revealed the full text of the proposed changes to the Intermediary Rules and put out an analysis on how it was taking us towards a china model of digital command and control. Throughout the winter session of parliament, we organised briefings for MPs and their offices on legislation that impact your privacy rights.
* **Free Expression:** As threats grow to online censorship, through censorship codes, the revival of Section 66A (*yes, we discovered it was still being used despite being ruled as unconstitutional!*) and internet shutdowns, we fought back. Our work over the past month includes a court intervention by the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) which relies on an IFF study, parliamentary briefings and notices to various bodies, particularly on online video streaming services. Surely, no one will want to watch a censored final season of the Game of Thrones?
* **Net Neutrality and Innovation:** To ensure that the existing net neutrality laws do not become a dead letter we have started examining options at enforcement and remedy. The first step in this is data collection. IFF has launched an online form to gather reports of blocking of VPNs and proxy websites. In addition to this our policy work continues. We are actively corresponding with government bodies and participating in TRAI consultations. For instance, in the latest OTT consultation, we have asked TRAI not to license internet services and applications. Yes, we are not giving up on saving the internet!

Our work is towards action, that causes positive impact and public victories. All of it is captured in simple, concise explainers on the [**IFF website**](https://internetfreedom.in/).

## Support our mission in 2019

Want us to scale up our efforts? Become more effective in our work? Ensure victories for your digital rights? Then consider [**donating to IFF**](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/)!

# Background

Back in 2016, the principles of Net Neutrality were established in India when the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India prohibited Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services. This effectively prohibited pricing and technical discrimination as offered Facebook’s Free Basics services. In 2018, TRAI further solidified net neutrality in its recommendations which the Department of Telecommunications adopted to make license amendments. However, there have been lasting concerns over the years that largely deal with lack of enforcement of these Rules. This brings us to the current day scenario where we have been witnessing rigorous website blocking by TSP/ISP’s with no legal justification. We have been updating you in our previous [**posts**](https://internetfreedom.in/what-the-block-our-net-neutrality-rules-require-a-monitoring-and-enforcement-structure/) of these rampant occurrences.

### ""The Present and Future of Net Neutrality in India""

The Centre for Communication Governance at NLU Delhi and the Internet Freedom Foundation organised an engaging discussion on “The Present and Future of Net Neutrality” this on March 14, 2019 (Thursday) at the India International Centre, Annexe. The reason behind organising such a gathering was to examine Net Neutrality's existing regulations and concerns but more importantly identify the necessary steps forward to protect the spirit and intent of net neutrality. The panellists comprised of experts from government, academia, civil society organisations and industry. Additionally, we have created a report summarising significant aspects of the discussion ([**Read here for more**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vCL0niT1AjiymaxLHHpibuitgCK2es_-/view?usp=sharing)).

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://i.redd.it/kqy6wibu6hm21.png)

### #SaveTheInternet

As we have explained, over the past few months, the Internet Freedom Foundation has focussed its efforts on identifying the violations of Net Neutrality through blocking of website access. It is in light of these current threats to net neutrality, it has taken the step to activate the [**SaveTheInternet.in**](https://savetheinternet.in/) website on March 18, 2019 at 8:00 AM.  
The website has been designed to move beyond email support for net neutrality to active petitioning. With a direct ""[**Take Action Petition**](https://savetheinternet.in/petition/)"" button, it provides individuals and organisations with the opportunity to show support to list of joint demands sent to the relevant government offices. We continue to make it possible for you to [**submit reports**](https://savetheinternet.in/report/) of any net neutrality violations to us.   
However, the buck does not stop there. We at IFF will continue to monitor violations as we have and to the best of our abilities will ensure the spirit of Net Neutrality is maintained in India. Through this data we will be armed to take advocacy actions, make formal complaints and ensure TRAI and DOT enforce the necessary enforcement mechanisms.

https://i.redd.it/62i3y8dr6vg21.png

### Highlights

* **Background:** The draft Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules, 2018 were opened to public consultation. Initial comments from various civil society organisations and industry groups were released to counter-comments till February 14, 2019. 
* **Recall the proposed changes:** We submit our counter-comments to MEITY showing our support for the concerns of Civil society Organisations while contesting the submissions of some corporates and industry bodies that would hurt online privacy and freedom of speech. 
* **We will challenge if these changes are made**: We have clearly stated in our counter-comments that we intend to support and explore all legal remedies if these unconstitutional changes come to pass. We will continue to champion the fundamental rights of ordinary Indians who use the internet.  

### Why should you be concerned?

Do you china style restrictions on the way you can use the Internet? Neither do we. The changes proposed to the Intermediary Rules in the guise of safety, do just that. Curb your right to freedom of speech and to privacy. Previously, we explained to you that these Rules affect you whether you are an individual ([click here to read](https://internetfreedom.in/civil-society-and-research-organisations-are-unanimous-proposed-changes-to-intermediary-rules-must-be-recalled/)) or a start-up ([click here to read](https://internetfreedom.in/we-call-on-tech-start-ups-to-protect-their-users-and-businesses-press-for-a-recall-of-the-proposed-changes-to-intermediary-rules-itrules-saveourprivacy-righttomeme/)). 

These proposed changes were put to a process of consultation that ended yesterday night. In our counter-comments, we put together the tremendous support shown from Civil Society Organisations highlighting the unconstitutionality of these proposed changes ([click here to read our counter comments](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rxJoEHM1m6IXprXENQyJwxU1cMSZuu6d/view?usp=sharing)). We stand with these Organisations in the fight for your freedoms as we submit our counter comments to MEITY.

However, there are always two sides to a coin. A few Industry Groups and companies are in complete support of these Rules. For instance, Reliance Jio  states that, *“We strongly recommend that the intermediary should enable tracing out of originator of such information on its platform, which will help Government agencies identify the originator of such misleading information and hold them accountable in order to maintain cybersecurity.”* Sounds a little like a neighbouring country! 

### Defending our constitutional promises

Apar Gupta, Executive Director at the Indian Freedom Foundation in an [interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/technology/india-internet-censorship.html) with The New York Times warned, *""This is very similar to what China does to its citizens, where it polices their every move and tracks their every post on social media"".*

Throughout this process, we have tried to ensure these Rules are recalled. The Rules allow for ‘tracking’ through the weakening of end-to-end encryption, it necessitates providing the Government with information at the drop of a hat and also the removal of content on the internet based on still developing automated tools. These changes mean the information you send over applications could be traced by the Government. An intermediary could be required to provide any information about you. Anything you post on the Internet that is considered ‘unlawful’ could be taken down. These are just a few examples. 

Fundamental Rights are a constitutional promise to every Indian. But these rules are an affront to our civil liberties. 

### Video Explainers

Want to learn more? We collaborated with Bisbo (a youtube creator) to create video explainers in multiple India languages ([English](https://youtu.be/TfMEOF3gL6g), [Hindi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCh835mOt3I&amp;t=224s), [Bengali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtzvSRQppQA), [Gujarati](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRq5KqRUN-s), [Punjabi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aZvUX4RX7Q) *more to follow...*). Do watch them and send them to your college and family Whatsapp groups! The Rules are unconstitutional and violate our fundamental right to privacy and to freedom of speech and expression. But, if these Rules were to be passed in their present form you can be assured Internet Freedom Foundation will explore all means to challenge them - this includes going to court.

https://i.redd.it/c1cgoerbovg21.png

### Highlights

* **Background:** In March, 2015 the Supreme Court by its judgement in *Shreya Singhal v. Union of India*  declared 66A of the Information Technology Act to be unconstitutional because it violated our fundamental right to freedom of speech. However, a study conducted by IFF found fresh cases continued to be filed.  This meant people were being prosecuted, even ending up in jail for a law which does not exist. 
* **PUCL goes to court (again):** PUCL one of the original petitioners in the *Shreya Singhal Case* approached the court highlighting this study. The Court issued notice and asked the Government to respond which finally acted in January, 2019 and issued an advisory to all State Governments and asked them for data. For instance Kerala reported 18 cases while most state governments did not respond. 
* **Supreme Court protects us again:** Yesterday, February 15, 2019, a series of directions were issued by the Court to not only close existing Section 66A cases but also prevent fresh registrations. These included directions for the Shreya Singhal judgement to be sent to all courts in the country, to senior administrative officers and director generals of police. 

### Background

Previously, we explained to you the why Section 66A of the Information Technology Act or what we called the ‘legal zombie’ was despite being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of India still being used in courts and police stations across India ([Read here for more](https://internetfreedom.in/66a-zombie/)). 

Section 66A was a criminal offence that permitted the imprisonment of anyone that posted offensive comments on the Internet. It was a vague section that was arbitrarily interpreted. This is why it was struck down. But it seemed to enjoy a half-life with continuing prosecutions and fresh FIRs. Yes, just like a zombie.

To put a stop to this we collaborated with PUCL which took the research study to court. PUCL is India's leading human rights organisation and had litigated important victories for the liberties of ordinary Indian's like you and me. It was one of the original petitioner's in the Shreya Singhal case which lead to Section 66A being declared unconstitutional. Continuing their leadership on this issue they filed application registered as MA 3220/2018 in W.P. (Crl.) No. 199/2013 filed by PUCL seeking the Hon’ble Supreme Court to provide directions to ensure prosecution under 66A does not persist ([Read here for more](https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-supports-seeking-a-stop-to-66a-cases-righttomeme-section66a/)). 

### What happened in court?

We are happy to let you know in yesterday's hearing on February 15, 2019 prayers in this application were largely granted by the Supreme Court. The case was listed in Court Room 6 as Item 52 before the bench of Hon’ble Justices Mr. Rohinton Nariman and Sanjay Kishan Kaul. PUCL was represented by its team of lawyers lead by Mr. Sanjay Parikh, supported by Advocates Ramesh Pukhrambam; Sanjana Srikumar; Apar Gupta and Abhinav Sekhri and the Union of India by the Attorney General, K.K. Venugopal and many other lawyers who assisted him.

This came after the Ld. Attorney General supported PUCL's plea for the need for greater awareness and sensitisation of courts, prosecutors offices and police. Prior to the hearing in a counter-affidavit the Union of India detailed steps it had taken to generate awareness on Section 66A. This included a letter it wrote on 11.01.2019 and then a reminder on 14.01.2019 to various State Governments asking them to furnish data on Section 66A cases and also asking them to close them. 

Some responded. For instance Kerala stated that there were 19 cases that were filed after Section 66A was held to be unconstitutional and they would be closing all of them. We expect greater compliance as the Hon'ble Supreme Court due to further directions that were issued by it (we will link the order when it is uploaded on the SC website). This included sending a copy of the Shreya Singhal judgement to all Courts, Prosecutors and Police Departments in India. As we indicated in our study that while ideally Section 66A should be removed by an amendment act of parliament, this is a promising outcome and will be a major check on fresh Section 66A FIRs. 

We are grateful for this outcome which has come through in a non-adversarial manner. Reach out to us if you become aware of any continued prosecution under Section 66A. At the same time we promise to remain vigilant, collaborate with other organisations to ensure public victories on fundamental rights.  After all legal zombies such as Section 66A have this uncanny tendency to rise from the grave. 

# IFF's role in the proceedings

IFF has not only supported research that provides a studied basis to reliefs sought in court but through its executive director appeared in the case and assisted PUCL in management and work execution. As indicated before IFF will continue to engage with courts for public outcomes on digital rights. We will collaborate, support and work with other organisations, groups and collectives. We continue to urge people to [**support PUCL**](https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-supports-seeking-a-stop-to-66a-cases-righttomeme-section66a/www.pucl.org) by signing on and becoming its members and making donations to them.

We promise to seek remedy. #SaveTheInternet #SaveOurPrivacy,"In Aria Thaker’s [article for Quartz](https://qz.com/india/1516366/is-jio-helping-indias-porn-ban-by-blocking-proxy-vpn-sites/) on the 8th of January, she reports on activity on India’s subreddit, where users had started a thread reporting that Reliance Jio was blocking proxy websites. This includes websites like Hide.me, VPNbook, Hidester etc. all of which are websites that allow the user to mask their location to access information on the internet when the same is blocked in their area.

The principle of Net Neutrality (which not has regulatory backing through license amendments) holds that telecom companies which provide internet access and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are required to treat all data equally, not interfering with the access choices of the end user, and thereby, any providers selective blocking of proxy websites is extremely concerning as it contravenes this principle and regulatory compliance.

Further, with the lack of a codified privacy law in India, blocking VPN sites completely leaves users devoid of any sort of privacy online, which means that any action on a service providers part, takes away a technical protection for one of our most essential fundamental rights. To this end, we are putting out a Google Form to the public. The intention behind this form is to collect data on which websites are being blocked and by which ISPs, after which we will look through it and see how best to remedy the situation, by complaints, approaching Government ministries, regulatory bodies etc.

Remember our post on the secret meeting to the change the IT Rules? Well, after it was no longer a secret due to an Indian Express report, the Government went ahead and announced a public consultation. Yesterday we sent in our comments to them. Read on for the details. These proposed changes can drastically increase online censorship and hurt your privacy. 

# Highlights

* **A private meeting with a proposal to threaten our fundamental rights:** On December 24 2018, the Indian Express [**reported**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/it-act-amendments-data-privacy-freedom-of-speech-fb-twitter-5506572/) that in a private meeting with a few social media companies and industry representatives the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) proposed disturbing changes to an online law that would result in grave censorship and surveillance for Indians. We that very day published the [**full text of these proposed changes**](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/) with an influential analysis that guided public debate.
* **A ""public"" consultation:** Shortly after it MEITY announced a [**public consultation**](http://meity.gov.in/content/comments-suggestions-invited-draft-%E2%80%9C-information-technology-intermediary-guidelines) on the proposed changes. These were proposals to make changes to the liability exemptions for online platform or service provider. An intermediary is any service providers which transmits, hosts and publishes user content. So it can be your ISP, email provider, social media platform, or any web-service which allows you to post, upload and publish. These platforms because of their technical ability to connect us to others, host our data, publish it, help us realise our freedom of speech, they mediate our online experience, impact our privacy and hold great power.
* **Recall these proposed changes, start afresh:** Yesterday we sent [**our submission to MIETY**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pDQt1M81spH66kv0CHcUk8P9U_Dp9_oc/view?usp=sharing) noting the problems with the proposed changes. Our clear demand is that instant consultation with the proposed changes needs to be withdrawn. We fear this exercise is expending energy and resources on the basis of draft legal rules that lack any clear rationale that has been articulated by MEITY. The proposals themselves are substantively harmful to our fundamental rights as we explain in our submissions are unconstitutional. We instead advocate for a fresh exercise with a white paper to update our legal rules. IFF believes that our government should protect people rather than merely seeking greater powers over a few dominant online platforms.

# Analysis

This has to be the most peculiar public consultation we have participated till now. Usually public consultation exercises are done with an approach paper or first trying to understand what specific harms, benefits, or policy objectives we are trying to fulfil. Only after that is done some legal provisions are identified for change or introduction. This is not the case with the consultation on the proposed changes to the Information Technology Intermediary Guidelines Rules, 2011 (the IT Rules). On December 24, 2018 the Indian Express [**put out a report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/it-act-amendments-data-privacy-freedom-of-speech-fb-twitter-5506572/) that revealed some proposed changes were put in a private meeting to a select number of social media platforms and industry bodies.

The same morning [**we published the full text of these proposed changes**](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/). We noted problems early on with these proposed changes on grounds of privacy and free expression giving feedback rule by rule. This was widely covered by the press and became a major news story [**coming shortly after the MHA notification**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ministry-of-home-affairs-delegates-snooping-decryption-hacking-powers-abrogates-responsibility-and-undermine-privacy/). Later in the evening that very day, MIETY [**announced a public consultation**](http://meity.gov.in/content/comments-suggestions-invited-draft-%E2%80%9C-information-technology-intermediary-guidelines) on the same rules. This was without any approach paper or explaining the rationale of the suggested changes. We found this to be not only strange, but also harmful to public confidence as internet users, who will face the impact of these changes the most were de-prioritised where feedback was first sought from large, private online platforms.

We object to the substance of these proposed changes which result in undermining our fundamental rights by turning online private intermediaries into policing agencies by – breaking encryption; empowering the government to gather more personal data; using risky automated filtering; and sending monthly reminders to behave ourselves. We clearly put across our demand to recall these proposed changes and end this consultation. It is not going to lead to any meaningful change or addressing the range of harms which today require a balanced policy conversation which should then move towards legal changes.

This is drawing scarce resources and time in a critical year for our digital freedoms. We need to seriously address issues of online content censorship, privacy, discrimination and due process. The present approach both in process and substance is misguided and even harmful.

[**Our full submission to MEITY can be found here**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pDQt1M81spH66kv0CHcUk8P9U_Dp9_oc)**. Read them! We try really hard to write them in simple, non-lawyerly or policy English.**

https://i.redd.it/jvawqsmfa1l21.jpg

Internet Freedom Foundation has been actively engaging with the issues of net neutrality ever since our triumphant win for open and non-discriminatory access to the Internet. We emerged victorious when net neutrality in India acquired solid footing through recommendations issued by the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) prohibiting Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services. In brief, [**we explained**](https://internetfreedom.in/trais-recommendations-are-another-big-victory-for-net-neutrality-but-follow-up-action-is-needed/) how TRAI recognised the principle of non-discrimination broadly interpreted with good reason, providing understandable exceptions along with a mechanism for transparency and accountability. However, over the years in extensively covering this issue, we have become privy to various bumps in the supposed unhindered existence of net neutrality in India.

Currently, a particularly concerning threat to net neutrality, looms the web. IFF has been engaging with users for a few months gathering evidence through its online [**reporting form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfW1hG9msgaILOLk1EMEY3V3UDJIZlTJPRoxgkIO7pUzuZ2aA/viewform)of extensive blocking carried out by not just one but various ISP’s. In a [**previous post**](https://internetfreedom.in/more-than-100-people-report-violations-of-net-neutrality-all-over-india-we-need-enforcement-action/), we disclosed a [**data sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5ToesR8HCcH6bmP_s7s5jN6YlYw4t4l-ovCpmY7xyc/edit#gid=1822363676) and provided a summary of the reports based on information collected.

### Updated Summary

1. Over the month, the number of reports provided to us has seen a considerable increase now standing at a total of 171 responses of blocking, beginning January, 2019 to March 8, 2019.
2. A large portion of our findings are mobile internet users at 62.9% while 29.3% are wired connections, graphically represented below as well.
3. Reports show that blockings conducted by Hathway have begun more recently over the past month and a half restricting access to Proxy Services, Virtual Private Networks and majorly the Telegram website.
4. Over the past few days, there have been increasing complaints against Jio for the blocking of Reddit in cities ranging from Bangalore, Chennai, to Pune and Noida.

&amp;#x200B;

### Seeing is believing

Understandably, one would assume a direct correlation between illegality/immorality and blocking. However, this is far from true. It has spared no corner of the web, from pornography, proxy and torrent sites, VPN's to even mainstream platforms like Archive.org, Telegram and Soundcloud. Most recently, we discovered reports as from various users as in the summary above, that **even** Reddit has been blocked specifically on Jio GigaFiber, if accessed without VPN. We provide a few instances below to exemplify our reports since naturally, seeing is believing. However, we go beyond it to active monitoring of ISPs by the DOT for compliance and eventually towards remedy.

### Is it a violation, you ask?

This blocking trend has raised significant concerns regarding its impact on net neutrality. The fundamental aspect in maintaining net neutrality is the equal treatment of all data with no restriction on the access choices of the user. The Department of Telecommunication in the amendments it carried out, aim to ensure this. Ideally, this created a prohibition on internet service providers from either speeding up, slowing down, restricting choice, bandwidth and the ability to access anything on the Internet.

It is important to understand the illegality behind these current swarm of blockings:

* Violation of Net Neutrality - Firstly, an ISP is not permitted to engage in any discriminatory treatment of content. Discriminatory here indicates any form of *discrimination, restriction or interference* in the way it treats content - it goes on to include practices such as *blocking*, degrading, slowing down or granting preferential speeds or treatment. Therefore, in light of our current block-mania, it is in clear violation of net neutrality.
* Type of Practice - Secondly, even if such practices are engaged, there is a mandate on ISP’s to be *proportionate, transient and transparent* and can be carried out only under specific conditions. We have examined a variety of reports concluding that there has been no explanation by the ISP’s for the blocking; the continuity over the last few months clearly it not temporary and neither has it been conducted transparently with no information being provided by the
* ISP Requirements - Thirdly, the conditions it fails to comply with are of particular importance to us. These practices can be conducted if an ISP is reasonably *managing traffic*, *providing emergency services* during a grave public emergency, in order preserve *integrity and security* of the network/equipment, in pursuance of an *international treaty*and most applicable to us, in *implementation of a court order or Government direction*. Evidently, the latter is especially not the reason as per an RTI request (Read here for more).

Additionally, what is of further concern is the absence of mechanism that monitors, reports and provides users with a medium to lodge complaints against ISP’s, as a safeguard. In an [**earlier submission to TRAI and the DOT**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qQcA73a63IydEZqr0XVGhG7Nak2BHvhS/view), we suggested there be an enforcement mechanism of sorts, in line with the recommendations made by TRAI. This will provide users with a well established redressal process to address net neutrality violations. We are in dire need of transparency and an enforcement mechanism as the number of merely recorded reports are becoming increasingly commonplace.

Our fight for net neutrality has stood its ground in the face of continued opposition through out these years and we will not be slack in this attempt to undermine one of India’s most significant digital victories. Over the next few weeks we will be attempting to organise a convening of important stakeholders to this conversations, examining steps for actual enforcement, remedy and complaint. We would be failing in our duty to protect Net Neutrality if we do not pick this up soon.

https://i.redd.it/ilckrmk6oxb21.png

In November 2018 the TRAI released a consultation paper on the regulation of OTT services (basically online platforms and services). Telecom companies said some terrible things about the internet in TRAI’s OTT Consultation. We wouldn’t stand for it and responded in our counter-comments. We submitted comments on 8th January 2019 and our counter comments yesterday night, i.e. January 21, 2019.

**Highlights:**

* **Licensing the Internet:** The proposals pose a test of substitutability to assert that OTT and TSPs (telecom companies) provide similar services and that they should be regulated similarly. They say this is necessary for continued investment in network infrastructure.
* **Questions on policy and economic basis:** We found from data that the economic stress on telecos comes from the intense price competition they face due to the extremely low prices of their competitors. There is also no clear data on the amount of investment needed in the sector. To pose regulation for internet services in the absence of not only causation, but even a credible correlation to economic losses of telecom companies is a harmful public policy choice.
* **Protect users, not telecos and platforms:** We submit the need for legislative action and regulatory reform in the domains of privacy, consumer protection and competition law frameworks. When it comes to internet policy, end users should be the most important stakeholders. The consultation queries posed by TRAI to an extent fall outside it's jurisdictional scope. We further suggest that it must conduct a specific consultation on interception and surveillance reform in the telecom sector.

https://i.redd.it/85zunnb5bxa21.png

This post is not about Game of Thrones, Sacred Games or Mirzapur. But it is. A lot of Indians are today turning off the television set and increasingly logging onto online streaming platforms. Here they are getting a wide diversity and choice of content they have been denied till now. A lot of this has to do with the nature of online content streaming which also facilitates at its very core a wider range of ideas and expressions that have been heavily censored and prohibited in cinemas and on TV Channels.

At this crucial time, as per a report in yesterday's [**Economic Times**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ib-may-endorse-self-regulation-code-for-online-video-players/articleshow/67550022.cms?from=mdr) and [**The Ken**](https://the-ken.com/story/video-streaming-self-regulation/), the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) has proposed ***“Code of Best Practices for Online Curated Content Providers***” and sought endorsement by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) and the Ministry for Electronics and Information Technology (MIETY). As we set out in our letter of concern to IAMAI, we call on them to reconsider this proposal, it creates a de-facto censorship mechanism which will only become more pervasive in time. This will be to the detriment of the entire online video streaming sector.

We have explained how this is harmful over at our website, written to IAMAI and are considering steps to correspond and urge the government not to take this up.

&amp;#x200B;

Update (21.01.2019) : We have received an acknowledgement by the IAMAI that they will examine our concerns. Further, we will be exploring steps to prevent that an endorsement by Government of this self-censorship code.

https://i.redd.it/tbd5hfe7laf21.png

### Highlights

* **We won:** On February 8, 2016 the TRAI after rounds of consultations and a sustained public campaign in India made the, ""Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016"". This effectively prohibited zero rated services such as, Facebook's Free Basics and safeguarded the open and free internet. This was a massive public victory. 
* **Positive follow-up actions:** Net Neutrality is a bundle of measures which safeguard user choice in their choice of online content. This should not be interfered by internet service providers. Acting on TRAI's recommendations the DOT made license amendments on September 26, 2018 which also safeguarded ordinary internet users from technical forms of discrimination such as blocking and slowing down web services. 
* **Need for action:** Some may ask what good are legal protections if they cannot be enforced? This is our fear as well. Over the past few months we have been engaging specifically for enforcement of net neutrality protections in India and are committed to exploring a range of actions to make sure they do not exist just on paper. 

### Analysis

""*We won*"", was message that was broadcast far and wide on social media on February 8, 2016. Coming after a charged online campaign under the collective of SavetheInternet.in it signalled that public victories are possible. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on that day made the, ""Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016"". These regulations banned zero-rated services such as Free Basics which would have distorted the open and free internet and made our internet service providers interfere with our choices for online content. 

This victory and India's leadership on this issue has been acknowledged all over the world. This was only possible because of a large collective of volunteers, an engaged online community, the TRAI –  so many organisations and individuals who all took leadership on this issue. We thank them all! 

It is also important to see how this regulation has aged over time: 

* **Emerging consensus:** Academic studies and analysis acknowledged the harmful effects of zero-rated services over time. For instance a recent study analysed in [a post over at EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/countries-zero-rating-have-more-expensive-wireless-broadband-countries-without-it) notes, ""[*A comprehensive multi-year study by the non-profit Epicenter.works*](https://en.epicenter.works/document/1522)*, comparing the 30 member countries of the European Union (EU) on net neutrality enforcement, has found that zero rating business practices by wireless carriers have increased the cost of wireless data compared to countries without zero rating."".* Thankfully, such services are prohibited in India. 
* **Complete net neutrality protections:** The TRAI Zero Rating Regulation also signalled a principled acknowledgement of net neutrality in law. This has further been cemented by subsequent rounds of consultations and recommendations that have then been acted on by the Department of Telecom by making changes to license agreements. India today is arguably the world leader on comprehensive net neutrality protections in law that prohibit pricing (zero rating etc.) and technical discrimination (blocking, throttling etc.). We have much to thank for, but we must also now focus on action and enforcement. 
* **But what about enforcement?**: While we celebrate let us also temper our optimism. Our victories can only be maintained and enjoyed with positive engagement on net neutrality enforcement. For instance, after disturbing reports emerged of network interference by ISPs of proxy and VPN web services we curated an online form which now has close to 150 detailed responses and we are examining a range of advocacy actions. 

We are hopeful for collaboration on net neutrality advocacy and enforcement. We are open to all thoughts and suggestions on how to undertake effective advocacy actions. If you have any thoughts, suggestions, comments — more importantly, want to commit time and help us — write to policy@internetfreedom.in. Over next week we will also start pro-actively reaching out to people on this issue and launching a range of actions. Let us work together and keep winning.

https://i.redd.it/q7x8jmpq84f21.png

### Highlights

* *Context:* The Parliamentary Committee on IT has recently published a notice for a hearing on, ""*‘Safeguarding citizens’ data on social/online news media platforms’""* that will be held on February 11, 2019. This meeting invites representatives of Government and Twitter.
* *Broaden participation:* In line with our past representations when hearings were conducted on data breaches, privacy and to review the functioning of the UIDAI we are asking for greater public participation. This includes oral depositions by experts, academics, domain specialists, technologists and civil society groups.
* *Move towards outcomes:* We also indicate the need for the past hearings on these important subjects to lead towards outcomes. The mandate of the Parliamentary Committee on IT is to make recommendations to Parliment and the work and learnings gathered by depositions and submissions may perish if reports are not prepared and tabled before the next elections.

### Analysis

In continuation in continuation of our letters dated May 21, 2018, April 21, 2018 and April 5, 2018 and a formal memoranda and submissions we made on June 01, 2018 we continue to engage with the Parliamentary Committee on IT. We have today written to the Chairperson, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur and all the Hon'ble Members appreciating the vital role that is played by it in informing the lawmaking process issues of technology and human freedom.

[**Our letter dated February 7, 2019 to the Hon'ble Chairperson and members of the Committee on IT is available here.**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RBebpOEOri-DueBzn-Wxqa_-IAvzkOOt/view?usp=sharing)

In a digitally connected India the committee has assumed vital importance and held hearings on pressing controversies including, net neutrality; data protection and privacy; data breaches and the Cambridge Analytica scandal; and overviewed the functioning of the UIDAI. It's next meeting on February 11, 2019 comes after a representation of[ **allegations of bias of social media companies**](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/twitter-summoned-by-parliamentary-panel-after-anti-right-wing-accusation-1989447), specifically Twitter. Such hearings need to be broader and involve other platforms as well. But most importantly this hearing is correctly titled as, ""safeguarding citizens"" and we believe citizens should play a vital role in it. We believe the public, academic, civil society groups, domain experts and specialists are a vital component of this exercise. They need to be permitted the ability to make oral submissions which are right now restricted only to representatives of Government and Twitter.

Secondly, over the course of the past three years, the breadth of issues considered by the committee have been of vital public importance. However, any outcomes or recommendations which may form a report has not yet been made. As our board chair, Raman Chima has notes on the specific issue of data breaches and the Cambridge Analytica scandal,  ""*a final outcome of this Committee's deliberations on this important topic is also key, to ensure that Parliament remains relevant in how it seeks to protect privacy, rather than being overtaken by developments pushed by the executive and judicial branches of government.*""

We will continue to engage with the committee as firm believers in public victories which are possible through institutional engagement.

https://i.redd.it/rqk15qe8knk21.jpg

* **Background:** The Delhi High Court dismissed a Public Interest Litigation on February 8, 2019 by the Justice For Rights Foundation.  A similar PIL has been filed with the Karnataka High Court on February 2, 2019 requesting the Government to prescribe suitable legislation to regulate viewing content on online streaming services. 
* **Need for consistency:** The Delhi High Court in its judgement reinforced the adequacy of the Information Technology Act. We wrote to the Ministry of Broadcasting and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to ensure steps are taken to similar stance in relevant cases. 

### Background

Recently, the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi was approached by the Justice for Rights Foundation praying for separate guidelines on online streaming content ([Read here for more](https://internetfreedom.in/take-it-and-go/)) where the Court took a positive stand in maintaining the sufficiency of the Information Technology Act, 2000. However, in yet another Public Interest Litigation, the Karnataka High Court has served notice in a petition approached before it, seeking regulation of online video streaming services ([Find the order here](https://barandbench.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Padmanabh-Shankar-v-Netflix.pdf)). This petition has a slight twist to it. 

### If You Can't Beat Them, Join Them

While the attempt to create *new* guidelines took a bit of a nose-dive, what better way than to slyly use existing legislation to achieve the same goal. Unlike the case in the Delhi High Court, this petition additionally desires to include online streaming within the ambit of what is known as the Cinematograph Act, 1952. As a result, this would render it as 'public exhibition', requiring such content to be certified; regulated by suitable legislation with an appropriate Board through sanction. This would potentially function much like the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) likely to further extend its moral policing habits. It's highly unlikely that anyone wants a Pahlaj Nihalani regime on the internet. 

However, the basic premise behind this petition lies in the claim that there is a lack of legislative framework in the regulation of online viewing content. Keeping this in mind however, the Delhi High Court has rightly enforced the adequacy of the Information Technology Act, 2000 in governing content and the platform, establishing that there is no need for separate guidelines ([Read the Order here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W7g9fLcgG8vYBJuDag0NQY-OZru1npo6)). 

We wrote to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on February 20, 2019 suggesting steps in ensuring consistency in such cases in all courts ([Read our letter here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k0cy7gG4V2I8klsYzMi-COGQbnvgoPnN/view?usp=sharing)). Once again, we approach their offices requesting a press release on the order passed by the High Court of Delhi to ensure the positive stand receives greater awareness amongst both the Courts and the general public. We hope the Karnataka High Court will consider this to maintain such consistency in the not only the protecting of our right to freedom of speech and expression but also in the self sufficiency of Information Technology Act.

Proposed changes to Intermediary Rules must be recalled. #ITRules #SaveOurPrivacy #RightToMeme,"### 

https://i.redd.it/v82mt026awf21.png

### Highlights

* **Background:** In December, a private meeting was held by Ministry Officials with social media companies and industry associations. In this disturbing changes to the the Intermediary Rules were suggested. They would hurt our online privacy and be a massive blow to free speech online. 
* **Roll back this consultation:** We made it a point to explain to you the damaging effect it would have on your online freedom but we are not alone. Many other digital rights organisations have articulated a principled and powerful opposition to these proposed changes. 
* **You can help:** Send an email right now. We tell you how at the end of this post.

**Why are any changes to the Intermediary Rules important?**

Intermediary rules impact all of us. Think about the legal rules that govern your ISP (think : Airtel, Idea-Vodafone, Jio or others), or a large social media platforms (Wikipedia, Github, Facebook, Sharechat, Youtube, Instagram, Twitter etc.), even small start-up online services you use and enjoy (for me it is personally IndianKanoon). Any changes to these rules not only massively change your online experience but also threaten your online privacy and free speech. In this context, the proposed changes to them gain importance. 

**What changes have been proposed?**

In changes proposed late last year ([read more here for context](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/)) the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) proposed changes to the Intermediary Rules, 2011. This was initially done privately and after an Indian Express report, and us publicly disclosing them in full, MEITY acknowledged them and opened a public consultation. But there are problems with these proposed changes much beyond the initial secrecy. And it's just not us saying this. Many other groups are taking leadership on this issue. 

There seems to be somewhat of a unanimous response of several civil society organisations and research groups for the government to reconsider these proposed changes. Even though many have articulated different reasoning, emphasised a range of problems – constitutional, policy-oriented, economic and technical. They all seem to be in broad agreement that these rules are bad for users, internet companies and the internet. They would hurt your privacy and online free speech without making you safer in any meaningful way. Even we in our submissions to an ongoing public consultation have made a clear call to MEITY to reboot this entire exercise ([read here for more](https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-meity-to-press-reboot-on-the-intermediary-rules-saveourprivacy-righttomeme/)).

But, don't only take our work for it. We have tabulated a table ([PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1peFYrzfHwa5QoFMUFFtesdmMTdqEuDLi/view?usp=sharing) or [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1peFYrzfHwa5QoFMUFFtesdmMTdqEuDLi))  with the voice of digital rights and research organisations who in 16 separate submissions make a common point. The proposed changes to Intermediary Rules must be reconsidered, if not recalled.

**What can you do to help?**

Simple, send an email to MEITY. This will not take more than a few minutes.

* **Step 1:** Create a covering email with the subject, ""Proposed Changes to IT Rules"", which reads for instance as:

&gt;“I support attached spreadsheet which quotes digital rights and research groups in their submissions against the unconstitutional provisions of The Information Technology Rules 2018 that will affect my Right to Privacy and Freedom of Speech online. I call on you to recall the proposed changes to the Intermediary Rules, 2011”

* **Step 2:** Attach the sheet of comments ([PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1peFYrzfHwa5QoFMUFFtesdmMTdqEuDLi/view?usp=sharing) or [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1peFYrzfHwa5QoFMUFFtesdmMTdqEuDLi)) by digital rights and research organisations. 
* **Step 3:** This email should be sent to gccyberlaw@meity.gov.in; pkumar@meity.gov.in; sathya.s@meity.gov.in. 

In the initial public comments only close to a 100 comments were sent to MIETY. Surely, we can do better. The last date for submission is February 14, 2019. This valentines day we have a moment to show how much we love the free and open internet.

https://i.redd.it/jfxeeehcm1n21.jpg

 

Earlier in February, the Delhi High Court dismissed a Public Interest Litigation seeking regulation and censorship of online platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. In our [**previous post**](https://internetfreedom.in/take-it-and-go/), we applauded the Court for letting us Netflix and Chill but noted that the judgement contained an erroneous reference to the infamous legal zombie- Section 66A of the IT Act.

**But wait, how did the legal zombie rise from the dead again?**  
It seems that while recording the submissions made by MeitY, an inadvertent reference to Section 66A crept into the Court’s judgement. Before the Court, MeitY adopted a progressive stance and submitted that existing provisions under the IT Act were sufficient to deal with illegal content on online platforms. However, it looks like Section 66A was inadvertently mentioned as one of the tools available with law enforcement agencies for punishing people who post offensive content. Unfortunately, the Court recorded this submission in the judgement without noting that Section 66A had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2015.

**Leave no tombstone unturned**  
We first sent a letter to MeitY on 20 February 2019 to get the inadvertent reference to Section 66A removed. Since we did not know if there was anything being done on the Government’s end, we decided to file an application for modification ourselves on 12 March 2019 to avoid any further delay. The application was listed for hearing today and we were represented by our fantastic counsel, Sanjana Srikumar. At the hearing, we learnt that the Government had filed a similar application on 11 March 2019 which had been disposed off the next day. Our application was also disposed off according to the same terms and the Court agreed to remove the reference to Section 66A. We thank the Delhi High Court for promptly fixing this error and defending a free and open internet!

Based off worrying reports of blocking and a complete disrespect for India's Net Neutrality rules by ISPs we have activated [www.savetheinternet.in](https://www.savetheinternet.in/)

The  site has two primary functionalities. (1) A take action petition to  create an enforcement structure for active monitoring of ISPs and making  sure they comply with the rules -- a government body where you can send  in complaints for net neutrality violations; and (2) Till that happens,  a crowdsourcing form to gather complaints online of net neutrality  violations (this goes beyond blocking).

We  will undertake a range of advocacy actions including filing formal  complaints with the relevant government departments.

#  The Momentous Result

On March 24, 2019, we celebrated the four year anniversary of the one of the most significant judgements in the digital rights sphere, the case of *Shreya Singhal v. Union of India*. Many of you may have kept abreast with this tumultuous journey over the years, so here is a brief recap timeline of our adventures.

***2012***: When 21 year old student Shaheen Dhada was charged under Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 for her comment on the shutdown of public functions due to the death of late Bal Thackeray, the fight for internet freedom in India took flight. Section 66A criminalized the dissemination of certain types of messages that were offensive or menacing. This provision was used so indiscriminately for the prosecuting of individuals for their basic expression of free speech. As a result, a petition to amend this Section was filed in the Supreme Court against this disproportionate law.  


**2013:** After the Supreme Court issued notice in this petition, there were several others that filed petitions challenging Section 66A. We mention the a few groups such Common Cause, the online review website Mouthshut, The Internet and Mobile Association of India and the [**Peoples Union for Civil Liberties**](http://www.pucl.org/), to draw importance to need for collaboration amongst various stakeholders from diverse backgrounds. Individuals, civil rights groups and industry associations who all came together to further and deepen constitutionality.

***2015***: The challenge to this section took two years to receive the landmark judgement by the Supreme Court declaring 66A unconstitutional, however, this was merely the beginning of things to come.

### The Illegitimate Four-Year Reign

***2016***: Even after it was struck down, reports by the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) Crime in India released during the year, informed that around 4,154 new cases were filed and 3,137 arrests were made in 2015, while 2,423 arrests were made the previous year. In addition, about 575 people were still in jail on January 1, 2016, twice as many as the 275 in prison when the law was in force a year earlier.

***2017***: There were whispers of a proposition by the Ministry of Home Affairs to strengthen Sections 153A and 505 (laws that deal with hate speech and statements of public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code through amendments, rather than modifying 66A. An idea that received support by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.

***2018***: [**A working paper**](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3275893) by the Internet Freedom Foundation through Abinav Sekhri and Apar Gupta published a study of the continued prosecution under 66A despite it’s declaration as unconstitutional. It looked to media reports, online legal databases and reports of the National Crime Records Bureau to analyse cases. Through their study, they established that 66A lived on. However, we did see an update to electronic records of the IT Act and the Indian Penal Code on *Indiacode* that incorporated the changes the judgement brought about, making 2018 a little less grey.

***2019***: Blue skies appeared when in collaboration with PUCL, we took this research to court to ensure these prosecutions were stopped once and for all. Victoriously, the Hon’ble Court once again took a positive stance by ordering that a copy of the Shreya Singhal judgement to all Courts, Prosecutors and Police Departments in India to ensure complete awareness through the grapevine.

### The Current State of Affairs

But the Shreya Singhal decision was much more than about Section 66A. It concerned the intermediary rules which govern platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. It also dealt with website blocking. Both these issues stressed on the importance of protecting our fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression.

Over the past few months, the digital sphere has grappled with intense hurdles to its somewhat generally free and uninhibited state of being. We have brought to the forefront two further issues apart from the horrendous revival of Section 66A.

* *Website Takedowns*: Late 2018 saw the introduction of the Draft Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules which largely threatened to clamp down on the right to freedom of speech and expression through breaking encryption, automated censorship, *further* Government access to personal data ([**Read here for more**](https://internetfreedom.in/a16022019/)). However, before this was released to public consultation, the Indian express reported that these changes were first debated in a private meeting. Subsequently, we thought it necessary to make these changes public. This was promptly followed by a call for comments.
* *Website Blockings*: We portrayed in [**our very visual explanation**](https://internetfreedom.in/what-the-block-our-net-neutrality-rules-require-a-monitoring-and-enforcement-structure/), the violations of Net Neutrality through the rampant spike in blocking that are being carried out by various ISP’s all over India over the last few months. Initially, we collated the data received through our online reporting form but most recently, we informed you of our re-activation of SaveTheInternet campaign in light these various threats to net neutrality.

We thought that in light of the four-year Shreya Singhal anniversary, it was necessary to highlight that these victories not only take time but continued efforts. These results require constant advocacy action and follow-up. More importantly, the joint-collaborations with various like-minded organisations activists that truly care for your digital rights is what enable these triumphs. Without any of this, we face the risk of scale-back and recession as is happening right now.

Therefore, as far as clichés go, we assure you that we along with many others will continue to rage and rage against the dying of the light.

https://i.redd.it/5hawt3hdugo21.png

It's been a week since we re-activated SaveTheInternet.in. and we have received overwhelming support! Here is an update on the reports of website blocking over the last week.

Over the last few months, IFF has been on the look out for Net Neutrality violations. Through an online [reporting form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfW1hG9msgaILOLk1EMEY3V3UDJIZlTJPRoxgkIO7pUzuZ2aA/viewform)**,** we gathered evidence of extensive blocking carried out by not just one but various ISP’s all over the country. We created a [data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5ToesR8HCcH6bmP_s7s5jN6YlYw4t4l-ovCpmY7xyc/edit#gid=1822363676) and [provided a summary](https://internetfreedom.in/more-than-100-people-report-violations-of-net-neutrality-all-over-india-we-need-enforcement-action/) of the reports based on the information collected. A round total of 200 responses of blockings beginning January, 2019 to March 2019 was received.

In light of these rampant violations, we thought it fit to re-activate our #SaveTheInternet website and a week has passed since. The website has ""[**Take Action Petition**](https://savetheinternet.in/petition/)"" button, which allows individuals and organisations to show support to list of joint demands which is then sent to the relevant government offices. The purpose behind this decision was move beyond email support for net neutrality to active petitioning.  In this short period of a mere week, we have received tremendous support with about 970 signings.

The website also has the option to [**submit reports**](https://savetheinternet.in/report/) of any net neutrality violations to us. In addition to our earlier 200, we have received a further of 65 reports of such continued blocking. This is a brief analysis of the latest reports.

### Broad Trends

* We continue to see general blocking of porn, proxy, VPN, torrent and streaming websites; Streamable, College humour, Sound cloud, Telegram, Reddit and Alexa.com, as we did in our previous reports.  


https://i.redd.it/fp9bu0kgugo21.png

* There have been a few responses that indicate blocking of sites that measure internet speeds, gaming sites and some report pure latency being introduced for certain websites.
* A large portion of these connections are mobile based but there have been a number of wired connections reports as well.
* The ISP conducting the highest amount of blockings is Jio, both mobile and wired with some from Airtel, Hathway, You Broadband, Spectra amongst a few others. The blockings have been widespread, ranging from Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal to Maharashtra, Karnataka to name a few states.
* The most recent report that has drawn a considerable reaction from users is the blocking of indiankanoon and earlier today, taxscan. Claims are that a Government order has been provided for indiakanoon, however, there has been no evidence or reason for the blocking. Additionally, after this blocking was discovered, access has been restored to the website.

A consolidated datasheet of the form which redacts the personal details of the respondents is [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NvHjlRQSrfZZ2jTq3Qy97-Jla0AVnrAIo59smAvZ4wg/edit?usp=sharing). In our efforts to address these violations, we plan on sending a detailed response to the Department of Telecommunications and the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority of India of our findings.

1553341412,india,InternetFreedomIn,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4i9oo/thank_you_redditors/,18,104,,,"Thank you, Redditors!","Hi folks,

I had been reflecting on our engagement on Reddit for the past few weeks and thankfully I had some time today to get this out. Part of why I am writing this is often people devalue the strength of online communities in the growing waves of a global tech-lash. We often concentrate on the problems of abuse, loss of privacy or, mental distraction (*as we should*) but also forget the benefits of why we keep using these tools (*as we should not*). Here is a short thank you note explaining what the Reddit community means to us at IFF and how it is becoming instrumental in charting our journey.

Over the past few months we have actively engaged on Reddit and shared how we are building out an effective organisation to fight for our digital rights. But what are digital rights? Many do not even understand what privacy means? And to those who it does make sense, they do not see any clear path to winning on such battles. That is why IFF exists. We want to champion the ideals of fundamental rights with technology. A core part of this idea is enriching public debate. Through public engagement (*like here*) and making ordinary people stakeholders in the formulation of tech policy -- letting them know what's happening in our courts and government ministries. Even to make it fun and make it easier for them to participate!

Along with conversation what also matters are solid wins which come through institutional engagement. Some of our recent work demonstrates we can achieve public victories on important issues such as Section 66A, online streaming, internet shutdowns and net neutrality. This impact comes through first with small but tangible steps which seem incremental but build into giant leaps over time. None of this would have been possible without all of you. Most of the community here has been overwhelmingly supportive of our work. Has been curious, engaged and questioned us to do better. We could not ask for more. But we do when it comes to money (*which for us is not a bad word*).

To us money means resources which we strive to use effectively. That can strengthen our mission, primarily through staffing the best talent and building a team of digital rights all-stars. Here the Reddit community has been a tremendous boost to our work. A lot of the financial support for IFF has come in totalling to about 2.7 lakhs in the past three months. This is what we like to call grass-route(r) donations. Presently, in a given month we average about 80-90 donations and now with a monthly subscription plan that we built out we have 40 members (we started with zero donations in October and about 30 in November). Yes, these are modest figures even for a non-profit like us, but are have helped pay costs and hire people. They have demonstrated that IFF provides a valuable social service and many people are there to support it.

One area which is on the top of my mind --- where we can be better -- is involving volunteers. While many volunteers are working with us, we have lost many others due to a lack of interest. We hope to work up the magic sauce to make this work by one of our next hires a community and communications outreach person.

Let us know what we can do, or if you would like to help up. We have limited staff and resources, but are always open to thoughts and suggestions.

Thank you Redditors, have a great weekend!

Join us in our mission!","Over the past two months, we have been a noisy bunch over at r/India. Making posts every other day about online privacy, censorship and net neutrality. As we explained in detail with our [republic day letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ajyuju/a_republic_day_letter_from_iff/), this is because one of our principal goals is towards community building and organising. Our core belief is that battles on digital rights will only be won with greater public engagement.

Over the longer term, this will require high-quality staff. It will include programme officers who look at movements in policy process. A talented team of product technologists, community organisers, designers and even meme-makers to support and spark public campaigns. A policy technologist with whom IFF's lawyers can talk and understand technology, before they craft a constitutional argument.

But, this will only be possible with funding. The right type.  From every day (and night) internet users like you.

At IFF we recognise, to ask for money we have to provide a continuing utility. Value through our work, engagement and listening to your concerns closely. Forging a meaningful link between IFF and its donors. This is why we have to built a [membership program with recurring donations](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/). This model helps us have a predictable flow of funds and focus on our work. More importantly, it challenges IFF to meaningfully stay in touch with its individual donors. This is the culture we are creating where our funder profile matches with our work for internet users in India.

We invite you to try it out this membership model. Donations start as small as Rs. 100 a month and go up to Rs. 1500. For all members, we undertake to send monthly email updates and respond meaningfully. This even includes a quarterly call with IFF leadership for the highest tier of supporters. So, please consider a contribution by [clicking here](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/).

And, even if you do not for the moment want to make a financial contribution at present, please do consider upvoting this on Reddit or sharing this post on social media. We promise to continue our mission for fighting the tough fights, for your digital rights --  on the internet, in policy consultations, committee rooms, parliament and courts.

In gratitude,

Team IFF

https://i.redd.it/bldfh1q7tve21.png

On 20th December 2018, the Cyber and Information Security Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued an order which authorises ten security and intelligence agencies to intercept, monitor and decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource.

We called to attention the risks this poses to our online privacy saying that it enables surveillance without any transparency or oversight. It lacks any meaningful safeguards. These arguments are at the centre of the [**case filed by IFF** ](https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-court-issues-notice-on-iffs-petition-for-survelliance-reform-saveourprivacy/)which is challenging the legality of the digital surveillance system before the Supreme Court of India.

In order to get to the bottom of this order and do something about it, IFF filed six RTIs seeking answers to the following rather basic questions:

1. How many times has the government used its powers for an interception?
2. How many agencies have been authorized to intercept, monitor or decrypt data?    
3. The names and the directions provided to the abovementioned agencies.
4. Date, time and duration of meetings conducted by the Review Committee.
5. How many times has the government received requests from different agencies seeking interception? Number of requests deniedNumber of requests approved
6. How many times has an order been issued to prevent any offence which affects the sovereignty, integrity, defence or security of the state? Number of times order issued to investigate into an offence

According to us, these are very reasonable queries. They can help us understand how surveillance works in India. How much does the state tap our smartphones? How many times does it ask for our personal data from online companies? Such disclosure can suggest broad operational trends and the implementation of safeguards. Such aggregate data would in no way impact national security.

Well to our disappointment all six RTIs were rejected. The grounds cited are sections 8(1)(a), 8(1)(g) and 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act 2005 on the grounds that ‘Disclosure of information related to lawful interception/phone tapping/monitor or decrypt is exempted’. This basically means that the government is unwilling to tell us who has access to all our private data and why they have access to it. If anything this reply confirmed was the complete secrecy and lack of oversight in digital surveillance by the Government of our personal data.

Next steps? We will be filing an appeal against this denial and pursuing these RTIs to their logical conclusion.

We would also like to indicate that RTI Activist, Mr. Venkatesh Nayak (Coordinator, Access to Information, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative) has filed similar RTIs and received a similar rejection. He has recently penned a legal analysis on it [**at the Leaflet**](https://theleaflet.in/computers-intercepted-transparency-interrupted-mhas-cpio-refuses-information-about-december-2018-authorisation-order-under-the-it-act)​.

https://i.redd.it/w7exgs3hbxe21.png

On January 10, 2019, following up on reports of network interferences to proxy and VPN websites from Reddit and a story in Quartz India we made an [**online reporting form**](https://internetfreedom.in/more-than-100-people-report-violations-of-net-neutrality-all-over-india-we-need-enforcement-action/proxy%20and%20VPN%20websites) for users to report such instances. A summary of the reports is provided below and a data sheet has also been made available available as we seek further data and request for collaboration from the wider net neutrality community in India as we continue pushing for enforcement.

## Summary of reports

1. A total of 134 reports have been provided to us from the different cities and states spread across evenly over a 2 week reporting period. These include reports from major metropolitan cities and as well as smaller towns such as Siliguri, Udupi and Mindapur. We can reasonably infer this is a pan India problem.  
2. The reports primarily arise from users of mobile internet users (64.4%). They are concentrated across two telecom operators which also have licenses to provide internet services. These are Reliance Jio with approximately 85 complaints and Airtel with 41 complaints. Other telcos and ISPs which also find mention are, ACT Fibernet, BSNL, Vodafone and Hathway.  
3. The reports on blocking of proxy and VPNs are concentrated for Jio. These include detailed statements which go beyond the blocking of pornographic websites or domains which may be blocked by interim injunctions by orders of courts.  Most reports on Airtel conflate the blocking of pornographic websites but also state that it is blocking the Telegram domain (different from the usage of the app, or its download through an App store).  

A version of the form which redacts the personal details of the respondents is [**available here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5ToesR8HCcH6bmP_s7s5jN6YlYw4t4l-ovCpmY7xyc/edit#gid=1822363676).

## Preliminary Inferences

1. Users are generally not aware of the reasons for network interference with websites and internet services in India. There are no clear statements or information available on the reason which may emerge from any legal order that is made available to them. They also are left wondering if this fault may be caused due to a technical error or may have commercial or regulatory interest attached to it. Further, there lacks any institutional process to gather or request such information in a standardised manner.
2. There is a lack of any data gathering or reporting mechanism available for complaints about blocking and throttling. Hence, in the absence of any such system users are left to correspond with the consumer helplines of telecom operators which lack the technical ability and the incentive to address issues of systemic, network interference. It is not publicly known whether such monitoring even takes place by the Department of Telecom or by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.  

## We need enforcement to #SaveTheInternet

The extent of the complaints and our analysis indicates the need to press demands for the enforcement of India’s net neutrality protections. We call on academics, activists, technologists, civil society groups, network engineers and those from the wider net neutrality community to help us collaborate with data and then press for enforcement.

Please do write to us, we would like to share your experience and work on net neutrality engagement since the regulations were made, share our learnings and data, and discuss policy and enforcement actions in the true spirit of collaboration.  Write to us as policy@internetfreedom.in

Remember when we dramatically posted here, [""Help! Stop India from becoming a surveillance state""](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a8jp77/please_help_stop_india_from_becoming_a/)? This was when around the end of December last year a MHA notification was issued authorising 10 central agencies to snoop in computers. As we explained this was incredibly problematic, since it was without any proper checks and balances. 

While the public pressure did work to an extent and more people became aware of the issue, due to a lack of a positive response by the Government, we were forced along with 4 other petitioners to approach the Supreme Court. Today the court agreed to hear this case and issued notice in it directing a response by the Government. 

The full details, with the petition, are [available here](https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-court-issues-notice-on-iffs-petition-for-survelliance-reform-saveourprivacy/).

### Highlights

* **Background:**  In a public interest litigation filed by the Justice for Rights Foundation in the Delhi High Court, a plea was made for separate guidelines to regulate content on online streaming platforms. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) informed the Court that the Information Technology Act is a robust enough legislation. On February 8, 2019, the High Court agreed with this submission and dismissed this PIL. 
* **Industry proposes Self-Regulation:** In January 2019 at the India Digital Summit in New Delhi, the Internet and Mobile Associations of India (IAMAI) along with some prominent online video streaming companies created a code for self-regulation. As per press reports this has been presented to MEITY and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) for endorsement. We have in the past cited concern on this measure. 
* **Giving credit where it is due:** We wrote to MEITY appreciating the position it took in affirming the sufficiency of the Information Technology Act for online video content streaming even though some provisions within it require reform. We have also called on for additional steps including seeking a correction of the order (given it cites the non-existent Section 66A) and asking a copy of it to be furnished in similar public interest litigations. 

### Background

Three interesting events have taken place bringing us to this particular intersection. 

*One:* On October 11, 2018 a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by the Justice for Rights Foundation in the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi (W.P. (C) 1164/2018) requesting the Court for guidelines on regulating certain kinds of content on the online platform. This included web based shows such as Sacred Games, Game of Thrones etc., for vulgarity, pornography, abusive language, as you can imagine, the list goes on. This is not limited to certain adult-based content but even the use of the phrase 'Holy Cow' in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ([Read the PIL here](https://barandbench.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Delhi-HC-Netflix-Amazon-online-shows-Petition.pdf)).

*Two:* On January 16, 2019, the Economic Times reported an agreement among certain companies and the IAMAI on a code for the self-regulation by online content providers. We explained the deterrent effect this would have on your online viewing experience ([Read here for more](https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-a-rethink-on-the-proposed-self-censorship-for-video-streaming-platforms/)). 

*Three*: On February 8, 2019, a division bench of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court consisting of the Hon'ble Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Hon'ble Justice V. Kameswar Rao delivered a verdict on the PIL filed by Justice for Rights Foundation dismissing the petition. This was possible largely due to the positive submissions by MIB and MEITY. 

### Appreciation with a side of caution

The Hon'ble Court affirmed that while there is no separate provision for regulating online content, the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 were not only merely applicable but an adequately armed with Section 69 to block illegal content. It also contains an entire chapter of offences which can take care of illegal content. While we are concerned with some of them, this is an incremental victory. It prevents a heavy, licensing style system from emerging in the video streaming space which would threaten our viewing choices online. 

A large part of this result is due to the submissions of both the MIB and MEITY which pointed that there is no need for further guidelines when sufficiently stringent provisions are already in existence. Agreeing with them, the Hon'ble Court instructed that if the petitioner continued to consider content provided on certain platforms prohibitory, it should take it up with the relevant statutory authority. That's legal for 'tough luck'. You can find the order of the Court [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W7g9fLcgG8vYBJuDag0NQY-OZru1npo6/view?usp=sharing).

This is a positive outcome due to the submissions made by two government ministries. We have called on them to cement this with taking the following actions: 

* **Incorrect reference to Section 66A:** The Hon'ble Court order has referred to Section 66A of the Information Technology Act which was struck down as unconstitutional. Here  government ministries should ideally approach the Court and request for a correction of this error. 
* **Utilise the Order:** After such an application has been made and a corrected order is available it may be used in similar PILs which are pending in different courts over India. This will prevent any inconsistency and help maintain our online freedoms. 
* **Avoid according sanction to the self-censorship code:**If the IAMAI Self-Regulation Code for online video streaming platforms was to receive validation, it would result in it being accepted as an industry-wide norm. Cut to, the pre-censorship of your favourite shows. This would defeat the very beauty that lies in the uninhibited nature of online viewing content. Your shows would just be one magnificent 'bleep' like *Udta Punjab* and its 94 cuts. It is for this reason we urge both MIB and MEITY to maintain its position which it took in this case. 

We will be sending a letter for these follow up actions and also seeking a meeting with their offices. You can find our letter to MIB and MEITY [at this link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16ce4AZnFeya06YZm-qSLPhNTPlzVlWwlWljEhEMEUNc).

Around 2002, when the internet was around, but still not quite... everywhere. As the years rolled on, promises of a digital transformation emerged in sputters. I think I was not alone when I hoped that gigabytes of bandwidth could cure all ills. Fix our lives -- even larger social problems. Well, we are still not quite there.

But our lives are not quite the same.

In time, many of us have grown to not only use but love the free and open internet. But each day it is under threat. Take, for instance -- the ""Intermediary rules"". Any changes to them will impact all of us.

Think about the legal rules that govern your ISP (Airtel, Idea-Vodafone, Jio or others), or large social media platforms (Wikipedia, Github, Facebook, Sharechat, Youtube, Instagram, Twitter etc.), or even smaller start-up online services you use and enjoy (for me, it is IndianKanoon). Changes proposed to these rules not only massively change your online experience but also threaten your online privacy and free speech. 

**So how can you prevent these changes?**

* First, get to know about the Intermediary Rules. To make it easier, we have collaborated to create a video explainer. Yes, please do *youtube and chill* ([English version](https://youtu.be/TfMEOF3gL6g) / [Hindi Version](https://youtu.be/MCh835mOt3I%E2%80%8B)) 
* Second, tell the government to roll back these proposals. How? [Click on this link](https://internetfreedom.in/civil-society-and-research-organisations-are-unanimous-proposed-changes-to-intermediary-rules-must-be-recalled/) and follow three simple steps given at the end. 

These proposed changes illustrate the wider threats to our online freedom. To help win on these battles we need an organised fighting force for our civil liberties.

https://i.redd.it/4g6drd7sjto21.png

**Highlights**

* *Background:* There have been increasing reports of website blocking by various ISP's all over India. To which we built a crowd-sourced information form encouraging users to report violations of net neutrality they were facing.  
* *Need for an enforcement mechanism*: The main threat to net neutrality is the absence of mechanism that monitors, reports and provide users with a well established redressal process to address violations.

### Background

Owing to a large public movement on Net Neutrality known as SaveTheInternet.in, the Telecom Regulations Authority of India (TRAI) made the, “Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016” which banned zero rated services after much public protest. Further consultations on the issue of technical discrimination led to the TRAI eventually introducing amendments to the Unified License conditions which upheld the intrinsic connection between net neutrality and free speech.

### Need for Action

In our previous posts, we provided information of our analysis of the reports of blockings that we received ([Read here for more](https://savetheinternet.in/blog/what-a-week-updates-from-savetheinternet/)). We also explain why website blocking is a violation of net neutrality [here](https://internetfreedom.in/what-the-block-our-net-neutrality-rules-require-a-monitoring-and-enforcement-structure/). In brief, when any blocking is carried out without direction or order of the Court/Government, it is considered to be discriminatory treatment. Additionally, even if this measure is being engaged, it is necessary that it be done in a manner that is “proportionate, transient and transparent”. Neither of these conditions have been met and have left users with no understanding of the reasons for such blockings or a mechanism for redressal. Hence, in light of the growing intensity of such violations and after seeking advice from external legal counsel, we have made a formal representation to the Department of Telecommunications requesting for certain interim steps to be carried out ([Read here for more](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wS1gUa0nl3YLM2Tlhjpej8l97cZan-yZ/view?usp=sharing)).

* That as an interim solution, investigation into the reports of violation submitted by close to 250 prople, until an enforcement body in line with the recommendations of the TRAI, is set up.
* That the DOT enforce its authority to ask for records/information of compliance by licensors especially with regard to the complaints reported to us.
* That in ensuring deterrance of such violations, necessary fines for breach be considered.

However, these are *just* the initial steps in supporting TRAI's recommendations in creating an enforcement structure for Net Neutrality.

https://i.redd.it/xxlfwpx1yvl21.png

Have we got news for you!

The Centre for Communication Governance at NLU Delhi and the Internet Freedom Foundation invites you to attend a spirited discussion on “The Present and Future of Net Neutrality” this Thursday (March 14, 2019) at the India International Centre Annexe (Lecture Room - II).

Why the rager? We know you too have noticed the endless website blockings recently. First, Telegram, then Redditindia, today Alexa.com? Such restricting of access to websites is the most visible form of Net Neutrality violation as we have explained in our previous post. We began tracking violations through our online reporting tool, witnessing continued blocking over the last couple of months currently totalling to 171 reports. This clearly does not seem to be a temporary issue. Take a look at the variety we discovered!  Apart from the actual blockings, our main concern lies in the inability of users to lodge complaints against ISP’s.

Hence, this discussion will be led by experts designed to analyse the existing regulations and obligations on net neutrality. We intend to discuss measurement and enforcement steps to be taken in ensuring enforcement mechanism that monitors, reports and provides users with a well established redressal system to address net neutrality violations. There is need to make sure ""India's got the strongest net neutrality laws"" are not just on paper. We would love for you to come by to brainstorm together! This event is open to the public free of charge (unfortunately, only the Delhi public for now). However, registration is required and we're filling up incredibly fast. Please do register ASAP. See you there!

Agenda

Two panel discussions will take place: Panel I - “Net Neutrality Regulations in India” which will be moderated by Sarvjeet Singh, Executive Director, Centre for Communication Governance at National Law University Delhi.

Panel II -  “The Future of Net Neutrality” which will be moderated by Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Policy Director of Access Now and Co-Chair of the Internet Freedom Foundation.

The problems faced by the farmers large stem from their own community. At this point a large portion of them are basically economic liabilities.

It's is wasteful where 50% of our population generates only 18% gdp . We don't need to this many people and most of them are in disguised unemployment anyway

Raising MSP is basically BS and would just worsen the situation . The value of agricultural produce is usually quite low as compared to even other primary activities , this is true everywhere. Raising MSP would just put the government under more financial pressure.

The problem is largely because the land holding are too small . According to google in 2015-16 the average size was 1.08ha.

This is the biggest problem as there is simply no viable way to earn a profit from 1.08ha of normal land and crops.

It maybe possible if the crop is highly valued such as spices , medical herbs , rare or expensive flowers or other cashcrops but these things grow in a select few areas. 4-5ha can earn a decent if not high profit provided use of technology and commercial practices

Therefore the farmers just end up in an endless cycle of debt trap every few years. Small holdings cant earn a profit, the produce from these small lands just goes mostly for subsistence and there is little marketable surplus.

Despite what people say about giving technology etc. It won’t work. It would just put the government in debt instead of the people because of the same reason. These holdings are too small to effectively use technology , these farmers would gain some but still wouldn’t have enough profit to continue maintaining and using modern farming techniques and the same situation would be created.

Not only this but if a large area is controlled by a single person , he can work more efficiently , try more things as well earn enough to purchase technology himself without going into debt

There are only 3 ways I see.

1.      Consolidate the farmers land’s into corporates. I still don’t understand why farmers haven’t realized this . There are very few cooperates in this field , just seeing Mother Dairy or AMUL should have been example enough. The only way to make them do this is literally to use force as most of them are either not educated or unwilling for some stupid reason

 

2.      Encourage growing of more valuable crops wherever possible there is no reason to grow wheat or rice at place where the climate can support more valuable crops . Also by making these  people have more competitive market practices. The best way is to force them to do this by reducing protectionism

 

3.      Simply getting themselves out of agriculture . It is known that they have higher fertility rates. The only thing stopping their kids from acquiring education is their own stubbornness and idiocy. There is no reason to not send one of your 4 kids to school when literally everything related to and used in schools is free for them. They also gain money by just sending their girl child to school under Beti Padhao , Beti Bachao.

 

All in all we need to look beyond these woes and go for the long term using force if necessary. If we don’t this shit will keep repeating every few years. This is not the governments fault , these guys have every facility that maybe needed to get out that situation , it is not our responsibility if they fail to use it.

Unemployment will probably stay over 5% for sometime to come. Let's be honest no matter what any government tries our economy is not big enough to support 1.3 billion.

Absorbing people into agriculture and low or unskilled  jobs will just make things worse in the long run.

We all laughed when Modi said that we could sell pakodas but he wasn't kidding.

Selling pakodas and having a small shop is actually the only way everyone can earn money and yes there shouldn't be shame in doing so.

We aren't communist either. Big companies or enterpreneurs will always constitute the majority of the economy and this is not bad , unnatural or something we should oppose

Tldr; our economy is not big enough to support 1.3b people , unemployment will stay over 5% and it isn't govts fault. Economy is naturally dominated by a few
