spoiler alert people watched nt care ever watch analytical review movie dunkirk inception interstellar though fascinating unrealistic defied rule science mathematics common sense dunkirk christopher nolan s best movie yet recently watched wanted key thought see else people may gleaned movie gleaned something pertains indiachina standoff among thing basically dunkirk 400000 men british french stranded enemy territory ww2 enemy closing side british waiting rescue get back britain visible across channel dunkirk situated france s basically however movie span much unique nolan mindwrangling make interesting simple premise stated movie begin staggered timeline follows pilot spitfire 40minute long journey dunkirk follows struggle 3 soldier ship water trying escape beach day even end staggered timeline following seaman soldier day incident following pilot minute climax imo apart trying capture chaos war reflects two thing 1 british navy army existed hundred year airforce relatively new may also symbolic fact nation existed forever continue exist forever even face new one may come 2 advent new technology make u dependent see dive bomber keep killing thousand sinking rescue destroyer soldier keep asking airforce next focus butterfly effect farrier s fuel gauge broken given choice turn back chooses stay course end saving entire rescue chosen turn back plane shot would nt shot rescue may taken place effective similarly tommy tagged gibson along end saving life opening door ship sinking torpedo also see massive powerful destroyer bombed enemy unable rescue stranded soldier feat accomplished civilian boat highlight fact military might country spirit people win war something winston churchill alluded one address nation also try present one underestimate small nation like britain represented small boat may accomplish feat big nation represented destroyer may able achieve also another moment soldier ask civilian moonstone saying let nt reiterating fact military may let country country let soldier also see spirit people see dawson son heading fearlessly towards dunkirk rescue stranded soldier shivering soldier fortis leader afraid go back many time try force change course however hold steady determined complete mission also see civilian trust quick effective military bureaucratic red tape dawson nt wait navy set exact thing requisitioned and part movie would like mention relates india fact strength military nt everything war spirit nation matter india never cower china may better machine better people next element poetic justice movie see tommy stand gibson dutch boat saved moonstone highlander want sacrifice gibson french tommy member highland regiment forced come air burnt alive poetically speaking burn hell alex pragmatic v tommy moralistic comparison face resolution guilt different time tommy considerate observant remember one talk grouping bullet hole notice man handing blanket train station blind old guy say well done asks survive old guy say s enough guilt burden resolved peacefully sleep train alex hand superficial nature burning guilt le regard others think guy ashamed ca nt even look eye face guilt night even read hatred people headline newspaper look people see applauding spitting face reflects see world lot feel inside also touch upon fact ultimately soldier guilt burden lessened country feel successful nation make feel victory front eye nation always want validation also see peter tell fortis leader george okay even though dead suggests sort duty civilian grant clemency soldier relieve burden also movie seems sort touch fact one good soul worth many average soul seems like good people keep taking place many average people movie eg gibson save tommy alex others drowning end drowning farrier save 300000 british soldier beach dive bomber army broken perimeter end taken hostage german always seems like take place many good people god heavenuniverse content exchange one soul soul many also show miracle nt happen every miracle cost life someone else someone else s sacrifice someone else s gain glorification war duty towards glorifying young men encouraged die futility many time name war see aboard moonstone dawson peter george set sail rescue stranded men dawson peter save many men fulfill important mission george join want hero war zone want photograph paper observing trying make useful end dying could actually something substantial futile death suffering war highlighted man trying escape destroyer get caught ferry destroyer end crushed leg also difference dawson peter look shivering soldier leader fortis air trio dawson try understand pain look human peter look coward wanting die war end however see experience change peter give clemency fortis leader lying saying george fine see dawson approves reflection war change people reflection duty towards soldier duty towards nation also see irony dawson sympathizing plight shivering soldier afraid go war kill george trying prevent dawson rescuing soldier dawson s son died war see effect war people camera show peter tommy two people almost age one weighed horror war lad coming term disillusionment war also see civilian make hero hero formed nation accepts see peter dawson get george s picture printed newspaper peter gain satisfaction reflects every life lost battle treated respect irrespective circumstance satisfaction loved one childrensiblingsspouse make ultimate sacrifice vain even many war futile contrast thinking people accordance rank situation soldier fighting dutch boat want sacrifice french nonhighlanders survive hand french gibson save tommy alex twice opening door second time slipping rope boat also see discord french soldier asks tommy move along french line beach beginning movie admiral hand want stay back help fench end movie seen earlier movie admiral saying get army back next battle happen britain seems dejected britain seems dejected britain seems hold destroyer saving next battle see military let people civilian never another example highlander boat refuse let tommy alex gibson slip rope also see spirit civilian hail arrival soldier done survivedon hand rank may really mean much see farrier end saving day fortis leader trembling mess end killing civilian movie try highlight soldier ordinary men best survive extraordinarily stressful event one minute one event time also focus effort many remain unsung war like soldier accuse collins aka airforce enough station dawson reassures know country never let soldier nation s validation important soldier fighting ending fact farrier keep gliding even last drop fuel run capture spirit soldier nation fight last breath fact even dying manages save thousand people shooting last plane show even soldier country going save people country give miracle living farrier instead ejecting plane land give proper patriotic sendoff burning go show people country nt jump go respect end even burning due war internal struggle whatever also reflects fact though main player may gone farrier many people survived would carry legacy line ending movie say even britain went colony abroad would carry legacy word regarding legacy colony point movie lastly show plane flame structure still stand respectfully good person like farrier showcase entire europe burned world war making spirit structure europe survived due good men reflection respect country determined character people entire movie theme common war army spirit people army may let country country never let poetic justice find way war change people duty citizen laud soldier choose fight regardless everything also appreciated small thing incorporated eg beginning dive bomber bomb beach explosion far away sound delayed visual explosion explosion come near delay decrease something correct according law physic never seen depicted movie commented head watching movie past tommy meet gibson attending nature s call s wrenching survived attack life go attend business disturbing attack life routine soldier reading newspaper u movie capture well dive bomber throw bomb bridge tommy cover ear s depiction war hero like many movie true depiction soldier human chose go war face horrible situation also depicted farrier show perplexion uncertainty many time really liked dutch merchant sailor nowhere came help guy fact none army men knew anything tide anywhere fact presence mind help people crazy stunt machine gun brawn like tommy decides take stretcher get aboard ship farrier keep track fuel asking collins incident dutch nt understand ballast told weight little thing quite meticulous s put together right shall add think something else forgot jot someone brings good point let know gleaned http wwwredditcom r india comment 719nda

understanding petro dollar possible decline fiat currency affect india maybe s time look elsewhere hold foreign reserve whole thing came recently discussion people use dollar international trade would happen major economy world stopped using dollar impact brics u many war middle east supposedly oil never really take oil u rich 800 military base around world defence budget larger rest world combined country still hold u dollar reserve u trillion dollar debt much debt u economy still afloat thought putting together anyone else may want learn gleaned reading matter economist anyone want correct anything would welcome accept criticism reference material substantiating point 1944 country entered bretton wood agreement basically said world ’ currrecies would backed u dollar u dollar would backed gold country could convert currency u dollar redeem u gold exchange rate 35 dollar per ounce gold since u largest gold reserve time 75 entire world s gold everyone agreed also allowed u treasury fix exchange rate dollar different currency set interest rate interbanking transaction etc however multiple war u ’ 60 caused domestic inflation u value dollar fall caused panic country started redeeming gold u treasury u gold fell 20000 tonne 8100 tonne quickly thus 1971 nixon closed gold window ie suspended ability nation redeem u gold dollar took gold backing u dollar allowed u retain gold reserve made need u dollar among country non existent everyone started move away dollar u economy started spiral price gold became 135 dollar per ounce top arab world hiked oil price u desperately needed stabilize spiral brokered deal saudi oil producer would trade oil nothing u dollar convince opec middle eastern north african oil producing country also invest opec ’ oil profit u treasury buying u treasury bond basically mean opec buying u debt u printing dollar amount foreign investment u treasury made oil producing nation oil profit basically profit every barrel sold opec make way u treasury become value dollar printed ultimately profit oil stronger dollar lesser profit oil weaker dollar thus u get double benefit every barrel oil way exchange u would sell saudi advance weapon gold demanded basically weapon gold sale exchange trading oil dollar prop u dollar gold still propping u dollar indirectly forcing oil producer trade dollar thus petrodollar born caused world need u dollar wanted buy oil needed u dollar either converting currency selling stuff u latter preferred cheaper exchanging currency also grows economy u became benchmark international trade since country hope grow economy without using energy aka oil ’ oil without u dollar long country need oil u print dollar thin air balance oil barrel explained without actually even owning single drop oil country need gold balance currency u need control oil need control currency traded keep economy afloat later u foreign policy similarly u bokered deal latin american country trade u dollar also give precedence u eu japanese product trade country decide shun dollar trade currency would eventually cause opec switch well dollar could collapse well u basically printing enormous amount money thin air money used domestically much larger extent globally international oil trade dollar stop people stop needing dollar use currency internationally circulating dollar would come back u many dollar little amount treasury would cause hyperinflation economic spiral however logical next step would destroy excess dollar coming abroad would keep country ’ economy afloat okay remember dollar printed foreign investment treasury profit oil trade dollar would go away well essentially leaving nothing treasury dollar valued hence dollar literally worth money printed second since u currency basically petrodollar power depends control oil right whoever control middle east major power today saudi arabia control middle east u control saudi arabia ussaudi brotherhood sort make impossible country influence russia tried decade establish strong foothold middle east unsuccessful also dictated u foreign policy far last 5 decade like said u need control oil reserve currency oil traded hence war hear oil actually oil per se intimidation tactic country announced would longer accept dollar currency international oil trade egs ayatollah iran announced intention denounce dollar oil trade use currency instead u backed iraq go war iran even provided weapon mass destruction use iran later used excuse invade iraq prosecuted saddam hussein iraq invaded kuwait major producer oil able pay loan kuwait later asked euro used oil trade rather petrodollar u invaded iraq gaddafi asked gold based dinar instead u dollar oil trade u invaded libya chavez u staged coup venezuela however starting nonpetro currency would break link oil middle east would become le relevant economic power interest energy concern still important le economic geopolitical chessboard u today may actually solution achieving peace middle east however another thing happens middle east control price oil tied dollar recently middle east opec basically saudi arabia decided drop international price economic reason country oil production major source revenue trade dollar eg many n african country venezuela seen economy completely stabilise destroyed country sick u saudi controlling market way affect country adversely hence country switching international trading system gold based currency cause economy stabilise international reserve eu etc hand seen increased holding opec country worried increasing power country international banking system would glad get rid holding non dollar currency would cause fall u dollar value lieu another thing need considered lot developing country international trade deficit trade deficit currency country debt owed internationally accepted currency eg dollar debt dollar conversion interest rate borrowing determined according rule u treasury rate u treasury linked value dollar country giving loan prefer dollar historically dollar strong trusted collapse hence money owe safe country taking loan also convert debt dollar easier country debt owed change value debt owed manipulating currency dollar determined conversion currency fixed rate safe everyone however slight problem owe debt 1 dollar someone pay debt depend value dollar currency particular instant dollar gotten stronger wrt currency shall pay money dollar gotten weaker owe le money currency hence fall dollar would beneficial country owe debt dollar bad country loaned debt dollar also taking debt dollar becomes cheaper value dollar fall since u treasury interest rate directly tied dollar hence becomes cheaper borrow dollar also said grows weaker still yo owe le money one thing consider regarding fall dollar uptil oil producer buying u treasury bond due bretton wood deal country u corporation u treasury give fixed rate interest investing treasury rate turn linked value dollar stronger dollar interest u treasury bond foreign country invest mean foreign country would much rather invest money u treasury assured fixed rate interest invest 3rd world country take risk maybe losing however value dollar fall country would much rather draw u treasury invest startup different country domestically etc side coin would country dependent u investment value dollar fall investment received u would lesser value hand one thinh like said investment dollar governed u treasury rule basically u bank cut tax money transfer conversion artificially keeping low fuel domestic world trade etc dollar collapse people ’ trade dollar would trade currency inetrbanking across world would governed rule currency trade eg brics nation follow tariff etc shanghai bank reserve held effect would depend rule bank deal detrimental beneficial depending bank ’ policy compared dollar also country holding u treasury would lose entire value foreign reserve hand coountries like brics reserve international bank would retain value foreign reserve bank mean indian currency would also fall fall dollar current state usually run around perception indian currency backed gold ’ true truth 99 today ’ currency u dollar euro indian rupee fiat currency ie value determined gold hold economic strength government average 4–7 country ’ currency today backed gold u dollar 45 indian rupee 5 rest held term foreign reserve country like form u dollar around 70 u treasury bond world bank imf currency around 25 brics foreign reserve etc currently r 1000 r 50 gold around 670 held form u dollar r 280 currency might ask well remember bretton wood agreement time u 75 world ’ gold backed dollar dollar backed currency currency country backed directly indirectly dollar gold difficult keep gold country convenient country hold foreign reserve dollar especially fixed exchange rate provided hence portion currency held dollar however nixon shock 1971 dollar removed gold backing automatically currency backed dollar 99 world currency also became fiat currency result however dollar still good trusted one thought much especially since dollar printed thin air however prospect trust dollar fading started worry expert senseless printing dollar exchange fiat currency total amount currency nowhere near compensated gold reserve even gold world put together would form 10 currency world putting disturbing detail aside dollar collapse 670 rupee 1000 would become worthless ’ wise hold u dollar many country woken fact china secretly amassing large amount gold opec country started removing capital u treasury see oil producer receiving u gold exchange trading oil u dollar accumulated holding country ’ treasury crazy gold received bought material asset like real estate etc even country simply sell u treasury bond buy asset gold real estate recent year start depleting treasury cause fall value dollar turn causing country withdraw invest elsewhere coupled russia china trade rouble yuan india iraq trading oil outside dollar germany china trading outside dollar strenghtening brics bank etc dollar showing steady decline india also wisen start replenishing treasury gold sell holding dollar euro invest currency rise one reason brics could important india country brics whether like another thing using another currency would would take away power u slap economic sanction whichever country choose one major reason putin teamed china order bypass u sanction edit thing worry nation international trade foreign reserve dollar give u single handed say economy like nixon s unilateral decision changed fate currency decision also change economy u dictate rule nt follow sanction country want take back power making decision hand next petrodollar based commodity depleted oil reserve declining world moving towards source gree energy nuclear energy etc petrodollar decline destined however would u next could shift backing currency nuclear reserve new crazy idea someone s hat inevitably affect country want say hand china s attempt start gold backed currency may pan like said gold world sufficient back currency world also since currency still large amount dollar backing fall dollar would make percent currency valueless therefore even reserve another foreign currency could still cause fall indian currency though might little mitigated hand fiat currency run investor
