Spent around 2 to 3 years after engineering preparing for government exams and after that I worked in a small digital marketing company. Currently I am working as a content writer and I earn 15K in hand with no other benefits. 6 day a week work and my parents were worried about my marriage because of my age. Therefore, they started searching for girls for me to marry. Apparently, I didn’t wanted to marry but due to the fact that sooner or later they are going to force me to marry, I decided to choose the best girl out of all those I have met. I chose one…our marriage got fixed and I really like that girl. My parents lied to her family about my salary and told them that it is 25k per month. I don’t like lying to my future wife and want to tell the truth. However, if she accepted me then she will be disappointed with my earning potential and if she rejects me then the marriage will break. My parents will get to know that I told the girl the truth despite being told not to by them. Also, if this marriage breaks then my parents will be disappointed in me and then the next girl will not be of my choice. I am in a dilemma. My parents are not allowing me to change the job right now as it might impact badly on marriage and telling me to search job after 6 months of marriage.

1546651818.0,3,4,13,"This is going to come across as a really valley girl problem. But honestly I've been too cut up about this. Using throwaway 


Backstory recap: fat girl, posh school, no friends, very middle class, supremely under confident, weird, nerd, no sense of style or fashion, very obnoxious 

I spent most of my childhood alone, with no one except my mom and dad for company and a motley crew of stray animals. I honestly did not have a single friend till 15 (she's still my best friend today though) and it wasn't an easy ride. I felt people don't really like me and that could be true because I would just clam up when faced with bullying or friendly interaction.

My father passed away at 16 and I went into a full nervous breakdown. I enrolled in college, still scared and obnoxious, but I could now talk to people. Not in a deep manner, more like in an unfeeling, small talk manner. Made a few friends and then dropped them because it was fucking intimidating.

Post a magnificently horrible relationship, I began to open up slowly and managed to get a whole group of friends in 2015-17. Which I lost after 3 of them pulled a prank on me that landed me in the ICU in the middle of the night. (I don't do harddrugs and don't honestly care if you do, but I got into an argument with one of the 'pranksters' who decided to spike my drink. On that night, I hadn't eaten a single thing all day, since I was doing intermittent fasting, and stopped by their house for a birthday drink before going home. They found opium along with a cocktail of drugs and pills in my system, it became a medico legal case, cops were called, the whole schbang).

I got into a serious relationship in 2016 (I'm married to him now, absolutely happy). 

Unfortunately, apart from him and two other close friends, I don't really have a friend group. He had a friend group, but he's a super introvert and from what I heard, he was the weirdo in that group.

I feel like I dragged him down with my unfriendability (not a word, please roll with it) even though he assures me that he only likes to spend time with a few of his close friends and cousins.

Why I'm rambling at 7 am when devastating and pressing issues are happening around the world: is this fucking normal? I'm totally content with not having a big group of friends and not having people to share everything with but I'm so guilt ridden that he's stuck with someone like me. 

I'm no longer weird or obnoxious, I've become fairly outgoing and I love talking and listening to people. But I have this weird gauge when the smallest things cause red flags to me and I can't stand certain things like bitching about a person when they're not there or bullying even when it's supposed to harmless.

I love people, I honestly do. I understand they have flaws. I know that I'm not everyone's cup of tea, but I cannot understand why I cannot maintain even superficial friendships..

But of late, after 40, I have been losing erections after some time and need to get stimulated again to get it back. I have no problems getting an erection, but I have seemingly lost that ability to sustain it continuous without stimulation for a long time as I always could earlier.

Since I don't think this is exactly a Viagra problem, I thought that maybe I could try an Ayurvedic course for a few days and see if it makes a difference. But there is a bewildering variety available there.

There are mixtures of different things like Himalaya Tentex Forte, Zandu Vigorex, Stay-On, Patanjali Musli Paak, Baidyanath Vita Ex etc. And then there are stand alone single ingredient stuff like Shilajit, Kapakacchu, Ashwagandha etc.

Sanity in this insane world that we've never imagined we'll ever be is non-news. And it should be yesterday because you've been through it and it's fresh in mind. I'll go first.

1. Yesterday I saw three donkeys after a very long time. I used to see and hear them almost everywhere. They've become a rare sight while I am growing up. They look old and don't look like they are in a good shape.
2. Yesterday I thought for few minutes why wasn't I am seeing monkeys in my neighborhood? They used to be everywhere in my childhood. That once again reminded me of a video made by one History professor on Pigeons in US. In early 19^th century 
2. Yesterday I watched a video on retrograde motion of Mars ~~mercury (and also sun)~~ again after a very long time. This time around I really wondered what it takes to observe such a motion. 

    a. First, curiosity of what's out there in the space; instead of just ignoring because it's been always there and can be seen everyday.

    b. Keep seeing one specific part of space, notice a specific object in the sky

    c. Identify the same object the next day

    d. Notice that that specific object has shifted it's position in fucking space and not a coordinate plane.  mean, you've got to have much more than a photographic memory to keep track of location of an object in space

   e. This comes before (d). The idea that I should keep track of it's location when you never knew it could move around/rotate/revolve.

    f. And the notice that the movement is strange. How many of us (in India) would do this in 21^st century? Apparently, this was observed by Greeks back in ~ 200 BC.
   
4. One auntie got mad at her husband/children and was screaming and shouting in no particular direction for a long time, even after they're gone. It seemed to stop at lunch time
5. I thought I should try making dosa using Chik Peas (Channa?) Yesterday I made batter and today morning I tried making dosas. It was a disaster. Was able to make just one dosa and it did taste dammed good. I am trying to make idli with the rest of the batter. It's work in progress.
6. All of a sudden Elpy mode is freezing my emacs. Need to find out why soon. I can't stand a monster memory guzzler Intellij.

1552747241.0,3,6,20,"Long wall of text ahead:

Hi, I'm a class 11 student going into 12th currently prepping for jee (pcm with economics) and basically I have various fields that I'm interested in, like basically almost all fields like econ, math, chemistry etc. and I'm very confused as to what path to take. In order of preference I like :
economics/math, chemistry then physics
(Note: there's not a big gap between all 4, but just a general layout)

I feel physics is ok and chemistry a bit better but it seems too much memorization.

I most likely want to work in R&amp;D in the field I join. I just feel that I would enjoy that type of work much more. I do not want to do a PhD as I don't think I will like academia and it's environment as such and 5 years I feel is too long for education. Im still thinking about it and trying not to jump to conclusions.

I do have a lot of interest (more than the others) in psychology (especially cognitive) and philosophy but I did not really think about it a lot as I have heard you need a doctorate to do meaningful work and if not most people end up becoming HR managers or something. I could not find a lot of data to research about this field though in India, abroad scenario is decent. 

I liked an applied maths or stats(didn't consider pure as found it to be too abstract) but in that case I'm scared I'm not smart enough to do it as I am decent at maths and have heard it's quite tough (though I like it but never really was the topper or anything in it).

I have considered engineering (as is the norm). I did like comp sci., materials, ee as potential fields. I know most of engineering is designing machines and processes but I don't think I would enjoy it much.  hence I'm not sure I will like engineering as a whole. But the salary and job security is quite lucrative even though I might not be that interested in it as other subjects and tbh peer pressure also. I am not that confident about JEE and don't think I will get an iit esp cs but you never know.

Coming back to other fields, economics is what I'm leaning towards most. I am interested in it as it satisfies my itch of psychology and maths.  There are various fields here too not to mention switching to finance so quite versatile. Also liked Econ as job prospects are quite a lot: finance, govt, think tanks, data analysis etc. etc.

I would like to earn a decent salary but I also do not want to be poor. I do not really care that much about a high salary as long as I find the job interesting. I also don't have any particular preference to be in India so abroad isn't really an issue. My parents are open-minded and never forced me into anything. Financially middle-upper class. 

Apart from studies I like to read philosophy and debates. I've basically given a bio data at this point. I do feel I'm overthinking a bit but I don't wanna be like many people who end up hating their jobs...

1553718534.0,3,21,8,"TL;DR : 12th student super stressed about future and career. And I want to hear stories of people who’ve been successful w/o BTech, MBBS, or LLB. 

Hey everyone 

I’m going to be giving JEE, BITSAT, CET, etc but I’m not particularly interested in engineering. Physics and Chemistry make me cry. I’m going to be honest, I hate the idea of engineering. I have known since I started high school that I do not want to pursue engineering. I wanted to study commerce after 10th because I’m genuinely interested in economics, accounting, bst and those subjects. 

I was interested in becoming an actuary. Lots of people recommend PCM at the +2 level to strengthen my base in mathematics. I was still against it. After a lot of crying and trying to persuade my parents, I still had to take science. Fine it wasn’t their fault, many Bsc degrees did require PCM and they did for me. 

Now almost done with 12th boards, which I’ll probably get ~87 percent in because I genuinely hate physics and chemistry. And I have a lot of pressure to give JEE and many engineering entrances. Parents talked to colleagues and many of them said if she’s smart, why does she want to get a BSc? Recommended CSE or MnC at IITs. So now, I have to give those stupid entrances. 

After all of that, there’s doubt in my head about other degrees. BTech degrees seem like the only possible option if I want to make big bucks. I feel like if I don’t get a BTech, that’s it I’m done. No good career. 

So basically, after 10th I wanted to study commerce but couldn’t. Agreed to study PCM for Bsc in stats. Now I have to do engineering. I’m not studying anything that I want. Just because I get good grades in PCM does not mean it’s doesn’t make me want to rip my hair out, because it really does. 

The point of this post is, I want to hear success stories of people who haven’t done MBBS, BTech, or LLM/LLB. I want to be convinced that not studying engineering is not the end of the world. I feel really bad about my future now. So if anyone could help me out, I would really appreciate it.

I don't know exactly how to explain my problem, I hope people from [r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india)will not make fun of it and will provide some really helpful replies. All my life I have studied in top institutes of this country(earlier due to my intelligence and later due to my reserved category). From the past few years, I have become a (below) average student in life(since my class 9). Things are getting deteriorated from then. I find difficult solving higher secondary maths and don't know any calculus/derivatives. But still I got admission in top college due to my category. Now that I m in PG, when I study logic/any maths related stuff in cse, I find it extremely difficult to understand abstract concepts of it due to my weak knowledge of maths and logic. Problem is not just I don't know fundamental maths, problem is my mind has become dumb from last many years that it has lost its logical/abstract conceptual building capacity. Due to this I scored average GPA in UG. I have to study for much more time compared to my classmates, still I score way less than them(some of them study like a day/night before for exams yet score better). Even now, when the teacher explain some concept in class, my mind gets lost easily but when I focus I do understand some logical concepts(eg. tableau method logic) but I can only solve those questions on which I practices before; unable to do some other/slightly higher difficult questions which require logical solving power.

Sometimes, I want to die because I'm unable to cope up with studies/life/career(as I can't go back in time to study 9-12 maths again). Tried for govt job like ssc cgl but was eliminated from tier 2 because of low marks in maths.

I want to change my life and break this path of deterioration. I want to build again the conceptual/logical ability of my mind and re-work on my maths skill(at least those concepts which would be helpful for me in current course). Also, I am not street-smart which works as a double-negative for me.

What can I do to recover my long lost mind power and utilize it to develop? I don't do any meditation/exercise, will meditation help me focus better in class or study? Please help me!

P.S.- I am disabled person, hence unable to do excessive exercises(running) or go out seeking professional help. Also, I do watch porn and fantasize it a lot (another bad habit I want to get rid of, as many times, I fantasize it in class with teacher which lost my focus in lecture).

1548617220.0,3,23,12,"I am turning 22 next month. First and foremost, I fucked up my Engineering (cs) real bad. My CGPA is somehow decent around 6.5 and I feel really bad about it because I could've done better if I had paid attention to the exams. I was not able to secure a job from college even in mass recruitment companies like TCS. Most of my friends with whom I had spent my whole four years now have good jobs and I wonder what kind of a failure I had been. I know I should look for a job now but somehow my morale has been down ever since. I have lost interest in everything, don't even smile anymore. Friends keep posting pictures of themselves enjoying and hanging around in bars and pubs and here I am thinking what went wrong. It was all my mistake. There's no one to blame but me. Adding to all that. my girlfriend left me 4 months ago saying why you got to be so depressed. I understand but I couldn't give her more of my time like other guys give. Nothing seems to be in postion right now, my mood suddenly changes like a wind. Loneliness made me somewhat closer to spirituality for there's nothing wrong to enjoy your own company. I used to smoke a lot of dank ganja during college days with my buddies endlessly but now I smoke to get some perspective on life. I also tripped on shrooms and that trip made me aware of how hollow your life is.


Right now, I don't feel like moving out of my bed. I live with my parents with all the comfort and amenities. It's surprising they haven't disowned me yet. You may tell me to shut the fuck up and work hard but I'm living a delusional life without thinking about the future. Should I live in the present ? I don't think so.

1547842536.0,3,35,36,"It's a simple, half-silly/half-serious question to ask, but the longer I think about or try to justify it, the more frightening it becomes. Here's my rationale:

I was formerly with a private ISP. Shifted to BSNL for their fiber line - faster speeds at a lower price. I also believed that they could not be less reliable than the previous ISP (Asianet) with whom I had a terrible experience.

However, I have since realized that I only really need high speeds for high porns. I mean, when you've got that instant gratification 4K thunder thighs triple-extravaganza on call... how can you resist? But that turns out to be a Catch 22, for me.

While the govt might need a warrant or some interest in me in order to request my browsing history from an ISP, their own company's servers have no reason not to log my every request. What stops BSNL from logging every one of their users? What do we know about their privacy and security (what we do know [isn't very good](https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/a-study-of-the-privacy-policies-of-indian-service-providers-and-the-43a-rules) )? 

So what, I hear you say, it's not a worry because I don't watch anything illegal? [The nothing to hide argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument#For_privacy) is an absurd proposition in the first place, and falls flat when you consider that some Sarkari Babu can bring up your naughty nautanki, and in the public domain, given our judgemental-asylum culture. 

I have no beef with the govt now and they have no beef with me, but should we have beef together someday, should I expect some NSFW Kompromat courtesy BSNL servers? Should I worry that I opened an article on Oommen Chandy just before (or during - I have severe ADHD) a steamy session - allowing them to put 2 and 2 together to make the point that I fap to Chandy?

Please don't suggest paid VPNs to me as I am broke. I don't care how you divide up or rationalize the financing of it I cannot afford it and I don't want to pay money to fap it goes against my atma.

Earlier in February, the Delhi High Court dismissed a Public Interest Litigation seeking regulation and censorship of online platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. In our [**previous post**](https://internetfreedom.in/take-it-and-go/), we applauded the Court for letting us Netflix and Chill but noted that the judgement contained an erroneous reference to the infamous legal zombie- Section 66A of the IT Act.

**But wait, how did the legal zombie rise from the dead again?**  
It seems that while recording the submissions made by MeitY, an inadvertent reference to Section 66A crept into the Court’s judgement. Before the Court, MeitY adopted a progressive stance and submitted that existing provisions under the IT Act were sufficient to deal with illegal content on online platforms. However, it looks like Section 66A was inadvertently mentioned as one of the tools available with law enforcement agencies for punishing people who post offensive content. Unfortunately, the Court recorded this submission in the judgement without noting that Section 66A had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2015.

**Leave no tombstone unturned**  
We first sent a letter to MeitY on 20 February 2019 to get the inadvertent reference to Section 66A removed. Since we did not know if there was anything being done on the Government’s end, we decided to file an application for modification ourselves on 12 March 2019 to avoid any further delay. The application was listed for hearing today and we were represented by our fantastic counsel, Sanjana Srikumar. At the hearing, we learnt that the Government had filed a similar application on 11 March 2019 which had been disposed off the next day. Our application was also disposed off according to the same terms and the Court agreed to remove the reference to Section 66A. We thank the Delhi High Court for promptly fixing this error and defending a free and open internet!

They seem to be either a bunch of thieves or the people who work there are seriously incompetent. Possibly the most pathetic company in the country - I'm disgusted at how much they're able to get away with. Shameless people!

About a week ago, I realized that their channel selection page timed out every five minutes and raised a complaint. They took several days to fix the issue. Tried doing it again today - the experience is seriously broken. In fact it is absolutely impossible for someone to complete the process without losing it. They seem to have put something in place just for compliance and are hell bent on swindling the people. Not sure how TRAI lets them get away with this.

[Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/GajaBuja/status/1089556780672110592) with all details.

Not sure what would wake these people up and make them empathetic to customers. If there was one guy in the whole company who had an Airtel TV connection and tried doing this, they'd have not put in place such a broken implementation.

Unemployment will probably stay over 5% for sometime to come. Let's be honest no matter what any government tries our economy is not big enough to support 1.3 billion.

Absorbing people into agriculture and low or unskilled  jobs will just make things worse in the long run.

We all laughed when Modi said that we could sell pakodas but he wasn't kidding.

Selling pakodas and having a small shop is actually the only way everyone can earn money and yes there shouldn't be shame in doing so.

We aren't communist either. Big companies or enterpreneurs will always constitute the majority of the economy and this is not bad , unnatural or something we should oppose

Tldr; our economy is not big enough to support 1.3b people , unemployment will stay over 5% and it isn't govts fault. Economy is naturally dominated by a few

People with more disposable income spend more. Their diets will improve. Besides if 2% of GDP lifts up 20% of the population then its money well spent IMO.

1547027780.0,2,40,0,"This is a blatant rip off of 8 Mile with an added masala of bollywood and cancerous rowdiness of Ranveer Singh. On top of that, bollywood makes shitty raps that means nothing other than a self-fellating bunch of tatti that's spewed with highly disgusting misogyny and stolen beats. The original hip hop culture was a fight against an unjust system. Today it is a vestige of a bygone era that is only reminiscent of what was once a show of art and discovery of a new style of music. What is left now is a barren landscape of electronic distortion. From this, we have the current crap (crop) of bollywood tatti that will be showered on us on 14th February. Somehow, it will be a 'new generation' thing that will rebel against some unknown powers that this film is trying to portray. It is being made by a person who has not seen the other side of the street and will not hesitate to misuse it for a pile of money that is not earned with dignity for it is an unabashed soulless copy of a surprise hit 8-mile. I can't wait for more shit 'rap-battle' movies to come after the success of this and idiots out there praising Ranveer (Apparently Self Made) Singh for his 'earth-shattering-mind-blowing' performance that is supposed to get him an Oscar and what not. There will be articles all over praising 'authentic' acting from Aila Bhatt and numerous phone ads in which she will talk about her struggle as a Muslim. 

Everything, about this trailer, looks fake. Just because you show an ariel shot of a slum does not make it look authentic. There is literally no underground rap-battle scene in Mumbai. There are no empty warehouses where people congregate to drop beats along with the rich and poor competing to battle out poetic superiority. 

Maybe I will watch it when it comes on streaming services. Until then, I know this cancer will be out there turning frogs in the water gay and making some useless asshole to think he can rap in some unknown underground rap battle den and turn into a star overnight.

And, don't get me started with 'Indian Rap Scene'. Most of these so-called 'creators' have been blatantly copying from American hip scene and shamelessly lifting beats. They have only added hip-hop to bollywood and have added nothing original to the milieu.

That being said, I understand your desire to watch this film and to fellate on Ranveer Singh, but for god sake, this is not original and it is not great film making.

It's a different thing if you know the person and you want to click selfies with them. But just walking up to white people and demanding selfies is simply crazy.

What do they even do with these selfies?

Note:-Unlike from the Newspaper articles given in the net, this is ""from"" the person who wrote it and what Many many had told...

This is related to the Science stream..

It all started on February 5th and we did not get enough time for revising or so ...Let me start from the practical section....

*Physics Practicals (Feb 5)-The experiments were easy. Almost everyone got the correct answer and the procedure part was typed in a simple way and everyone were satisfied...

*Chemistry Practicals (Feb 7)-This was easier than physics. Everything was balanced...No one found it difficult to get the confirmation tests..

*Biology Practicals (Feb 11)-The questions were of an easy pattern...The identification of specimens were not hard and the physiological experiments were also easy....

*Computer Practicals (Feb 13)-I'm a Bio student,so, with what i have heard, the Practicals were easy..

Now the fun begins...

*Computer Theory(Feb 18)-For many students the paper was easy...but for some ,output questions were hard. The K map and programs were easy by the way...(Said by a trust worthy source)

*English Grammar (Feb 21)-Although some grammar questions were a bit tricky but, question paper was overall very easy.The passages were silly but they essay choices very good.

*English Literature (Feb 25)-The Tempest was easy.. However, the short stories from""Echoes"" had dull selection... It compressed of 1 dull chapter and two philosophical stories.. The poems from""Reverie"" had a slightly better choice as it had one simple poem and two philosophical poems.. students actually did not expect this dull paper...

*Chemistry Theory (Mar 1)-This had a slightly unusual question paper ...the questions were somewhat different from the previous year types ,the numerical section was easy... the inorganic was kinda easy but they give more equations in organic section. The students actually did not expect some type of questions to be found here. Many did find it difficult... The most common review is, ""Just Satisfactory""... This paper was negatively reviewed by many students...

*Maths (Mar 5)- Sigh , this was the hardest Maths question paper CISCE has sent since idk....many many years i think.... The question paper was lengthy, the questions were harder... Many were not able to finish on the correct given time. Section A was hell for....many section B was kind of moderate while section C (which was mainly for the commerce) was much more easier...students had high hopes for this one but it was ultimately lead to a disaster... After all the exams which we are faced,this was the most negative received exam paper... For many, their dreams were shattered..

Analysis:-this year's question papers where harder than the previous years... Many had hopes, which lead to an utter disappointment... The chemistry and maths qp actually played with everyone... This was not a ""SATISFACTION""EXAM!!!

I actually have no idea what these ISC people are doing. Just making the question paper hard does not make a good standard. It's like the ISC people are trying to be the CBSE board. if this trend continuous for the coming exams and for the coming years,I don't think there would be anyone left to study for the ISC.Then, people would opt for CBSE or any local syllabuses... The main reason which people choose ISC was ""JUST"" .because they were studying in ICSE in the 10th standard. Now they are making fun with your lives.. it's like making all these 14 years go to the trash... And since India is a highly competitive country,the Board marks will surely affect those who are aspiring for high colleges...it has made thousands of parents lose their hope for the child and the pupils also have lost their hope for the coming exams and the ISC is doing a great job in that.

I don't know who is actually the wrong here...IS it the teachers who has not trained the students properly with proper methods of teaching and proper revision?????? Or is it just us who did not study properly for this board exam???? Or is it just council who is trying to bring a change in the ""Standard""of the paper????whatever it maybe it is just messing with our lives. And like common people ask ""what will you do without having good marks?""which is our situation... Demotivation is Never A Factor for Quality...

Based on the reviews of many,here is my rating of each subject in their difficulty level..

Computer Theory-1.5/5

English Grammar-1.75/5

English Literature-2.5/5

Chemistry-3.5/5

Maths-3.75/5

Note:-this is just the average ranking which I made after reviews from many many students... Personal ranking might be different, but, this is just a summation... I earlier did post this but, had to remove due to some problems... Thanks for spending your time reading this and share your thoughts... It took me some time too....

1551773503.0,2,3,16,"**Summary**

College dropout, only studied up to class 11

Self-learned everything I know today

About 18 years of work experience

Skills - C#, ASP.NET, MVC, JavaScript, PHP, ActionScript, plus databases and other relevant web technologies

Anonymised Résumé - https://www.filedropper.com/resumethrowaway

**Problem**

Seeking a job as a senior programmer or architect of some sort, but unable to get a foot through any door since more than 2 years.

**Current Job Description**

I have a job as a technical architect since the last year or so. I was working as a product manager at the same company before that. We use Microsoft technologies at this place. The job has paid bills until now. But the future is bleak.

The product we sell was built by a very poorly led team, and as a result, the implementation sucks donkey's balls. This severely affects our revenue stream and we lose customers as quickly as we get them. The previous architect was fired last year and most of the young developers have found other jobs and moved on. There's no cash left any more to rebuild from scratch and I'm afraid the company will go belly up in a few months.

**Steps Taken So Far**

I signed up with the usual job sites - Naukri, SO Jobs, Head Honchos, etc. and customised résumés for each application. I apply only to 1-2 jobs per week, so that I can really pay attention to what they want and highlight my relevant experience in the application. The only company that called back was Thoughtworks and told me honestly that I didn't have what they were looking for. Others haven't as much as nodded in my direction.

I'm at wits' end now and have no idea what to do. I'm past 40 and don't really have the chops to get into middle-management.

1546334126.0,2,18,19,"Since childhood, I was never into Indian movies like yeah been to theater a lot of times but mostly it felt average, nothing to give much of thought and just a means to forget your life and get into another world. Even some golden movies like DDLJ were uninteresting to me/never seen it so I thought maybe I like hollywood or other countries' movies because of the big budget, foreign feel with new things, great VFX, use of English and what not but honestly those things were secondary or external factors. It was mostly about great acting, good cinematography, the way they create private real life moments in front of camera, the way they live in those moments.

It's been nearly half century for the beginning of indian movies and we have nothing but few movies which were amazing attempt to sell new ideas making it worth a while eg. Swades,Dil Chahta hai and few others . Real was always rare in our movies and there was hardly any effort to move ahead of keeping love as focus or end goal.

Average movies also create average critics and also average or below average actors who make their whole career based on it being loved by average fans following. Honestly instead of porn ban we should had shitty movie ban which sells the idea of objectifying woman and normalize forcing love on some random person till they accepts it and yes these affects people as you can already see how people think beloved celeb personality is same as they are in their movies. All and all I  want to say it, 2018 was amazing leaving me hope for bollywood but nepotism still exists, my sister told me that the role of female lead in Simba(another average movie) was signed by a acting reality show winner but then was replaced by Saif Ali Khan's daughter.

There are some amazing underrated critics like Film Companion(Sucharita), Cinema Beyond Entertainment,Stutee Ghosh from the Quint,Mensutra(maybe)  and with the end of nepotism, I wonder how much Bollywood will improve with new quality actors and their creations.",t5_2qh1q,Just a thought about Bollywood after seeing recent Indian movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/abgu95/just_a_thought_about_bollywood_after_seeing/

1553709154.0,2,40,33,"In the past few years, a disturbing trend has become part of historical conversations. People, often lacking any actual background in Indian history, criticise Gandhiji for reasons that are not even factually correct. They believe that Gandhi had little to no effect on the Indian Independence movement and that he colluded with the British, although there is no significant evidence for either claim.

There are a few possible reasons for this. For more than half a century, Indians have believed that Gandhiji was a saint, quite aptly called a Mahatma. However, this portrayal of Gandhiji has proved to be rather counter-productive. The people were bound to be disillusioned by this image as he was only a man. Sadly, though, this disillusionment has come with a vengeance. People have suddenly jumped to the opposite end of the spectrum. This change in sentiment is due, in no small part, to the RSS and the venom that the organization spews through its members. There's also the disillusionment brought about by age. People tend to believe less and less in idealistic principles like Satya and Ahimsa as they grow older, instead believing in some sort of ""direct action"".

Many people place Bhagat Singh and Netaji Bose on a higher pedestal. While I do understand that their ideologies might be rather attractive, neither of them had a sustainable vision for India. Bhagat Singh believed in a strictly Socialist state, even leaning towards anarchism and Communism. His ideals of violent action would have brought more evil than good. Subhash Chandra Bose on the other hand committed a great folly asking for help from the Imperialist Japanese. It's hard to imagine what he expected. The Japanese free India from the British and then? They just hand it over? If the Japanese had not turned back from the North-East, we would probably have to fight a second War for Independence. This is, however, not to downplay the roles of either of them in the Independence movement. Every single one of the freedom fighters was a brave Indian and gave what they believed the country needed, and I deeply respect every one of them for it.

There are several criticisms of Gandhi. Some legitimate, some not so much. We could discuss any criticism you guys want to put forth. I just made this post because my heart sinks whenever I look at Facebook comment sections with people uttering absolute falsehoods against Gandhiji simply because they've bought into the propaganda around them. I couldn't just stay quiet anymore.

I am suffering from gyno ever since I was 12. Today I am 17 and I am currently appearing for my 12 boards. I am planning to go for a surgery next month when my exams get over and I get a proper period to rest and recover.

All I would like to ask is that, is there anyone who has been through this suffering, and would you recommend surgery? 

If you have already been through the knives, how was the experience and what would be some of the advices related to operation you would like to give me.

I'm ashamed of this., so I want to get out of this country on job possibly, if not on education as well.

Here's the mind-blowing overall medal tally:

- Gold : 85
- Silver : 154
- Bronze : 129

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs &amp; abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men &amp; women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

[Their homecoming pictures are the best thing I've seen today.](http://www.newindianexpress.com/galleries/sport/2019/mar/24/special-olympics-indias-medal-winners-return-home-amidst-glitzy-and-glory-102173.html)

1547451595.0,7,17,69,"After a win against Thailand and a loss against UAE, Blue Tigers are ready to take on Bahrain on 14th January in the final game of the group stage.

**Venue**: Sharjah Stadium, Sharjah, Capacity: 11,000

**Time**: 9:30 PM IST

**Opponent** : Bahrain started strongly as they managed to hold the hosts and group favourite UAE to 1-1. However, against all odds, in the next game they lost 0-1 to Thailand and now have found themselves at the bottom of the group with just 1 point. They'll be desperate to win all 3 points to qualify for the next round.  

**Where to watch?** : The game will be available on Star Sports, Jio, Hotstar. The users not in India can join us at /r/IndianFootball on match thread. We may have some more information about other options for the streaming on the day.

**Lineups**: Indian coach Stephen Constantine has started the same XI against both UAE and Thailand. We can probably expect the same against Bahrain as well. 

*Starting XI* : Gurpreet Singh, Anas Edathodika, Sandesh Jhingan, Subashish Bose, Pritam Kotal, Pronay Halder, Anirudh Thapa, Halicharan Narzary, Udanta Singh, Sunil Chhetri, Ashique Kuruniyan.

*Subs*: Narayan Das, Amrinder Singh, Balwant Singh, Jackichand Singh, Vinit Rai, Sumeet Passi, Salam Singh, Vishal Kaith, Sarthak Golui.

**Bottom-line** : As this is the final game of the group stage, the games will be played simultaneously. We won't know what exactly is needed for us to qualify. However, these are the three scenarios:

1. India wins - We'll qualify as either the group leader or 2nd in the group.

2. India draws - We'll go through to the knock-outs as one of the top ranked team among 3rd placed teams, or possibly even runner-up in the group. 

3. India loses - We still have chance to go through to the knock-outs, provided **Thailand lose against UAE** and the complex math in other group works out in our favour.

I'm 22 and will complete my engineering degree in the summer. All in all, I have become a completely disorganized individual. I'm having difficulty sleeping at nights and experiencing irregular sleeping patterns. I can't seem to get out of the rut or cycle that I'm in right now. For a month and half, I've been living alone in isolation in my hostel with dark curtains all the time just doing random stuff and killing Taliban in Medal of Honor but nothing seems to be working for me. I don't think parents would understand if I told them about my current situation, so I'd lie. I stopped looking out for jobs since a month or so because of some rejections and it's just too much for me. Everyone's running like crazy like there's some race going on. So called friends taunt me, ""What you gonna do, Bro. Why don't you have a job? Look at me!"" Well, I know that sucks. I didn't get out of my room for a week after that. I've had suicidal thoughts and still have. For over a month, I have kind of feeling lost in my own small world. I know you'll suggest to go out but my mind doesn't let me. It's jammed. I want to get out of this depressing cycle too. I think societal pressure played a big role on me starting from High School itself. It feels like the more and more I isolate myself, the more comforting it becomes. I missed out on relationships also. A girl used to like me and I think we didn't have quite an understanding, rather a lot of misunderstanding, especially by my side. I don't regret it. I simply can't care about relationships. I come from a very good family, at every aspect. Sometimes I feel like it's just too much. I need a break or something. I just want to die.

The guy is eating this heart shaped choco-bar ice cream sitting on a bench and he sees hearts are popping and flowing in a particular direction from his bar. Then he peeks in that direction and sees this over-sized lady blushing and thinking the hearts are for her. But then she leaves to reveal this beautiful girl (I think is played by [Nauheed Cyrusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauheed_Cyrusi), I could be wrong tho) who's also eating the same ice cream.

1549567106.0,1,40,93,"Just wanted to talk here - this is probably gonna be an incoherent wall of thoughts, but well, things aren't so great here either, basically, after surviving a brain haemorrhage in 2010, which is why we moved back to India(that happened so suddenly, and I had PTSD for about a year after that), my mom now has breast cancer which has metastasised to her lungs, brain, thyroid and abdomen and things aren't looking so great. I try to spend my free time with her reading magazines, and other miscellaneous stuff, thanks to cyberknife treatment, she is lucid at the moment and can walk around for a bit 

My dad is planning to quit working (In the country we previously lived in), and move to India and take care of my mom. He's 58, and says that he doesn't have interest in working anymore and that we would also be financially secure if his 2 bosses give him the compensation money when he quits. However, this would mean that me, my mom and dad will lose our international health insurance, for which now is a shitty time. He also recently got influenced by a relative who introduced him to a naturopathic doctor who will give him some herbal med for my mom to eat which apparently won't affect her ongoing meds, which I'm not really okay with but I support him on it anyway. When I tell him about how losing health insurance would be a risk and what is he going to plan, he just told me ""well that's life"" but apparently I'm supposed to magically not let this affect me and seriously prepare for boards/jee, in my middle school days too, my mom had stroke twice, for which I used to remain seriously prepared with all her files and would also comfortably transport her to the hospital in an extremely efficient way while also controlling my panic. She received her cancer diagnosis in march 2018, and it got worse in December 2018. Every day I just see it as ""its another 15 hours, the probablity of something going wrong and me not being prepared for it is less"". Also, my grandmother is kinda old and ""not really sane"" - she orders food as if she owns a robust factory and mass distributes the food to the neighbours forcefully, she even once yelled at my mom for being bald, she woke me up at 5 AM to buy milk even tho the milkman comes at 6 AM and other stupid stuff - she's kinda like the dictator of the house, which is still well within tolerable limits, as she has a rare blindness inducing disorder which she got in her young adult age

when relatives visit me, instead of appreciating me for taking care of my mom, they just say in a sad undertone ""at this age you should be preparing for iitjee and not worry about complex medical systems"" well genius I have no other choice huh now do I?

It was doing fine, but since last requirement, I felt too much of pressure in the company. I got sleepless nights, and decided to resign. I resigned the very next day. Then I realised, I would be jobless. So, I talked to my tier-2  ex-company and they are ready to take me in.

I see a lot of software engineers, a lot of frustrated engineers in my office. I find that most of them are depressed. But, still they continue their job. I don't know how can someone work in so much pressure.

It's been around 2 months of notice period, I have resigned and doing nothing. Most of the times, I watch movies and spend time in bed. 

But, I feel like an escapist. Sometimes, I think that I should leave these SE jobs, and start preparing for government jobs. Sometimes, I feel what will happen if I get the same work environment in government jobs too?

##A few facts and some history

The [Nilgiri District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nilgiris_District) is the western most district in Tamil Nadu, bordering Kerala and Karnataka. 

&amp;nbsp;

The [Nilgiri Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgiri_Mountains) kind of is the meeting point of the Western and Eastern ghats, when viewed in a map(you can see a small curve of mountains), but is completely detached from the Eastern Ghats. Although they are commonly called the Nilgiri ""Hills"", they are actually mountains, with the highest point being [*Doddabetta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doddabetta), which roughly translates to ""Big Hill"" in Kannada and probably [Baduga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badaga_language). This also happens to be the highest peak in the South of India.

&amp;nbsp;

The Nilgiris District consists of 4 major towns and several small villages. The capital is Ooty or Udhagai or Udagamandalam or Ootacamund. Interestingly though, the District was founded in Kotagiri, one of the other major towns. The other two major towns are Coonoor and Gudalur.

The major economic activies include tea plantations and tourism with real estate being the most recent addition.

&amp;nbsp;

##Getting Here

All towns, as a result of being perched upon the hills, requiring a climb by road for the final stretch. The only other way would be by helicopter, and we do have helipads here, but I'm sure most people on reddit would prefer to use other conventional means.


&amp;nbsp;

####Air

That said, the nearest Airport is Coimbatore International Airport, which is about 78 kilometres from Coonoor, 76 kilometres from Kotagiri and 97 kilometres from Ooty. The other means is by helicopter as I mentioned earlier.

&amp;nbsp;

####Rail

Coonoor and Ooty have railway stations but the services are limited to the Nilgiri Mountain Railway. The nearest proper railway station is Mettupalayam, but there is only 1 long distance train and the rest are passenger trains to Coimbatore.

Travellers from Chennai (and other places on the way from Chennai to Coimbatore) can travel directly to Mettupalayam on the [Nilgiri Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgiri_Express)(12671/12672) and thereafter by road to either Coonoor or Kotagiri. If you need more help with this PM me.

Travellers from other places will have to terminate their train journey in Coimbatore and thereafter travel by road.

If you intend to travel to Gudalur, taking a train is not the best option since it has to be access through Ooty on this side and through Kerala or Karnataka on the other.


&amp;nbsp;

**Nilgiri Mountain Railway**

The Nilgiri Mountain Railway runs from Mettupalayam to Ooty via Coonoor. They stop in many of the smaller stations too. I don't have the schedules as of now, but I will post them later. The journey is through a picturesque route, but is quite slow and will take you atleast twice the amount of time it will take you by road. The Mettupalayam - Coonoor route is serviced by coal fired steam locomotives whereas the Coonoor - Ooty route is serviced by a bio-diesel locomotive. There are a lot of tunnels, which make the ride interesting.


&amp;nbsp;

####Road

People from the Northern half of Kerala, near Wayanad will find it easier to reach via Gudalur, while travellers from other parts would find it easier to reach Coimbatore and continue their journey from there.

People from Karnataka will also find it easier to get here through Gudalur as well. Getting to Gudalur will require you to pass through the Bandipur and Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and the roads passing through them are inaccessible to civilian traffic between 9 PM and 6 AM. 

People from Kerala might face this issue too, but there are other routes which are not huge diversions.

For people from Bengaluru, if you intend to avoid the Bandipur - Mudumalai route, you will have to travel to Hosur, from where you will reach Krishnagiri. From Krishnagiri you have the choice of travelling to Salem, or via Mettur. Both routes will take you to Mettupalayam. The Salem route is longer but is entirely 4 lane highways except after Avinashi(close to Mettupalayam) whereas Mettur route is shorter but passes thorough several town and the roads are just 2 lane. The route after Krishnagiri also applies to people travelling from Chennai and other adjacent areas.

There are bus services to every major town and route buses to all villages.

I've travelled only to and from Bangalore by bus and will therefore only write about what I know. I am confining it to over night buses only.

To get to Ooty or Gudalur, the best bus to take would the SETC[TNSTC] or Airavat[KSRTC] which take the Bandipur - Mudumalai route. 4 buses, 2 from each service is exempt from the 9PM to 6PM closure, and there is a chance to spot wildlife(Last time I took the Airavat, people claimed they saw a Tiger, but I was fast asleep and woke up only after all the interesting stuff had happened). To clarify, 4 buses from either side.

Alternately, there are a lot of services that run through Hosur - Krishnagiri route, but I would recommend private services. I have taken the Green Line A/C Sleeper and it's by far the most comfortable bus I've been in, but it comes at a cost of ₹1500(excl. taxes) during the weekends and ₹1000(excl. taxes) on week days. In contrast, the Airavat Club Class, although it is only semi-sleeper, costs ₹808(incl. taxes). There are other cheaper services as well, like Mayura, SRS and KPN, but I have not been in those.

Most Krishnagiri - Hosur route buses will get you to both Coonoor or Ooty. The pick up/drop point in Ooty is the Bus Stand whereas in Coonoor it is near the Outstation Bus Stop, opposite Hyderabad Biriyani House(Somersait Building).


&amp;nbsp;

##Accomodation

For those looking for youth hostels and dormitories in Ooty, there is Zostel with prices ranging from ₹500 to ₹1000. While there are other hostels available, none are as good.
In Coonoor, there is the Backpacker's Burrow which sells rooms at ₹500. This is next to the Hopscotch Restopub, which I will talk about later. There are no other hostel services in Coonoor.

There are plenty of small hotels and lodges but you cannot expect much from there and most are the same in quality.

Ooty has a lot of good midsize hotels, and a quick googling will help you find one. In Coonoor, Hotel Vivek and Venky's are decent midsize hotels, but recently Venky's was in a scandal for allowing prostitution in the premises. There are Blue Hills and Riga but they're pretty run down. 

In Ooty, in the Luxury Hotel segment, you will find Gem Park, Sullivan's Court and Taj. In Coonoor, there is the Gateway Hotel(old, but people still prefer it over everything else) and The Orchid Square Hotel. The Orchid Square was built recently and it quite luxurious and modern. McIver's is another good place with a phenomenal view.

In the resort segment, I would recommend Destiny(lies near the Emarald lake. Huge property, run by the people who run, or used to run, KingsCliff hotel. It's quite beautiful), D-Rock(Near Lambs Rock in Coonoor. Gets quite cold and the view is just stunning) and The Realm Resort(16 kms outside Coonoor. Good place to be away from the bustles of the town.) 

When it comes to home stays, the entirety of the Nilgiris is covered in them and you will not have trouble in finding them.

The Clubs in the Nilgiris with decent accomodation would be Wellington Gymkhana Club, Ooty Gymkhana, Ooty Club, Lawley and Coonoor Club.

Kotagiri doesn't have any good hotel but has plenty of homestays. Gudalur has a few new resorts and a new hotels but I'm not very familiar with them. The new hotel is on the Ooty road, run by the Sasthapuri people from Calicut.


&amp;nbsp;

##Food

**Ooty**

Virtue Bakes has some really good baked stuff. For the sake of history, you could visit Shinkows, which is an old authentic Chinese restaurant, but Pow Ki is not as sharp as he was and the food is crap.

Royal Cafe has some good food, and Quality Restaurant has some good stuff as well. For some more mainstream TN food, you have Kuppana 

Modern stores sells some really good chocolates. The almond chocolates are to die for. King Star is famous for it's fudge. Try the almond fudge, it really good.

For Indian snacks, Prabha sweets is a good place, but we now have A2B as well.

The Culinarium, lies between Ooty and Coonoor, Yellanalli to be exact. It's run by the Pony Needles company, this is the same one as the one in Bangalore. It's a tad expensive but it's worth it.


&amp;nbsp;

**Coonoor**

Coonoor has a lot of specials, stating from the Crown Bakery bread, coconut balls and cakes. National bakery sells good *Varkey*. Indian Bakery *Varkey* is overrated.

Hotel Ramachandra has some really good Chili Chicken and a Mughalai Paratha type dish known as the ""Wellington Special"". It is a Ceylon Parotta, lined with egg and filled with Mutton Keema. Be warned, eating half is humungous a task by itself. 

Hotel Sri Lakshmi is a good vegetarian joint.

Open Kitchen has good pizzas and burgers. 

Cafe Diem(I have been told that their name has been changed; will update soon), has a beautiful view and has some good vegetarian continental food.

Other good restaurants are Quality Restaurant, Green Fields Restaurant, Jharokha, and 

&amp;nbsp;

**Kotagiri**

There are no good food joints in Kotagiri. Nahar has okay vegetarian food and Tandoori Hut has some decent non-veg.

I'm not familiar with food in Gudalur, so I'm going to leave it out.

&amp;nbsp;

##Alcohol

Alcohol is available in any of the TASMAC outlets dotted across the place. For foreign liquor you will have to go the Elite TASMAC in Ooty or some of the bars. The clubs will serve good liquour for very cheap and the bars in the luxury hotels will have some good stuff.

Hopscotch is pretty much the only happening restopub in the entire Nilgiris. They have events most weekend and the crowd is nice and the food is excellent.

&amp;nbsp;

Side Note: Hopscotch, Hotel Vivek, Greenfields restaraunt and Backpackers Burrow are in the same compound. It is owned by Suresh Lakshan Hotels, who also own Sri Lakshmi, Ramachandra and the Realm Resort.

 &amp;nbsp;

##Places of interest

In Ooty there is obviously the Botanical Garden, the Rose Garden, the Arboretum, Karnataka Park etc. In Coonoor there is the Sims Park and Katteri Park. But all these places are good to visit only when it is full blossom. So visit after mid March, until the end of June for an optimal experience.

The Doddabetta Peak in Ooty, Lambs Rock and Dolphin's Nose in Coonoor as well the Kodanad View Point outside Kotagiri are prominent viewpoints.

A trek to the Droog or Rangaswamy Peak is recommended.

Boating is available at the Pykara Dam, Boat House in Ooty and in Sims Park and the Wellington Lake in Coonoor.

The Boat House also has a lot of other rides which may interest you and near the Boat House, you have Thunder World, which is a park run by LA Group(Black Thunder, Jenny's Club etc). It has quite a few rides and a Dinosaur attraction, which is quite nice especially for kids.

In the Summer there are horse races at the Ooty Race Course. (I have never been to one so far, but intend to soon)

While in Ooty, you can also visit the ""Miles"", which are beautiful spaces with a lot of tourist movement. I, personally do not see anything attractive about these places, but a lot of movies were shot here.

The Ketti Valley is a beautiful place to visit, and the drive is just amazing. Take the Lovedale route, it's really beautiful.

Kundah, is one of the most beautiful places in the Hills. It is slightly remote but it is worth it. Visit the Pillur dam while your here. You could drive to the gates of Korakundah tea factory(civilians are not allowed inside), the drive is long but extremely beautiful. There are a few other areas nearby(I'm not able to recall the names), which are worth visiting.

The Ooty Gymkhana and Wellington Gymkhana have 18 hole golf courses while Highfield in Coonoor has a 9 hole course.

There are occasional cricket tournaments that take place as well.

&amp;nbsp;

####P.S: Please do adequte research and do not rely on this guide alone. I will make update the post or new information, once in a while. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out, but give me some time to respond.

&amp;nbsp;

#####The [Neela Kurinji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strobilanthes_kunthianus) is in bloom this year. It blooms only once in 12 years. The moutainside covered in purple is a sight to behold.

EDIT: This might be just in pockets since there was a bloom last year as well. I shall update this info soon.

&amp;nbsp;

Hope you have a wonderful time!

1549736452.0,1,39,20,"Okay, a little info about me, I am 24 years old working class male living in a metro city. So, around six years back I had issues with depression was under medication and all, but I stopped going to my Psychiatrist and joined a engineering college thinking I am alright and things will eventually turn out fine. 

Time passed on, I even made some friends but that part about me which craved a connection was never satisfied, I always felt like an oddity, someone who cannot relate to anyone, someone whom people don't want around, I even let people use me by helping them too much, by letting them make fun of me, and then college finished and I got a job, but I was never mentally satisfied in my life since I was diagnosed with depression. 

It's like depression broke my entire mental state, It made me believe in the meaninglessness of everything, made me lazy, destroyed my fears of things that can completely destroy my life, made me an social outcast and I have never been able to grow out of that personality. 

I think no one really knows me, no one in my family knows me except for maybe one person, no friends, no one. I became bad at connecting with people and sort of started accepting my loneliness but nowadays it gets really tough sometimes because of family issues, life in general and I feel like I have made no progress in my life ever, I have just wasted it away. 

You see, that feeling that you are worthless, but I am trying to change my lifestyle, my attitude towards life, towards myself and be a better version of myself. 

Now you can say why am I writing all this stuff up here, the reason is because I need some sort of support in my life, I am completely broken from inside tbh, and it will take some time and some support to grow again. I just needed to put some things out, because I cannot talk about this to anyone in my life. Not to my family, not to anyone of my friends, I am a lonely fuck.

Indians abroad (this is for about 90% of them) are like this:

They mostly mingle with people who are either Indian, or from an asian country for some strange reason, effectively blocking out interactions and experiences that they would normally have, and live in a bubble.

I've lived significant portions of my life abroad. Arabian Gulf, Finland &amp; Sweden.

Every single slur, dirty comment or remark passed about me, my religion, habits, language or culture has been from Indians, in or outside india.

This should say a lot about the sort of people we are. Generalising is dangerous, so don't take this out of context.

Europeans, particularly in the Nordics can be quite 'cold' by Indian standards. You can't chat up random people on the streets, it's just not done.

From experience, i've seen that the Indians who claim to experience racism or instances of intolerance are the ones who don't make the effort to integrate in a new culture. They search for Indians and then, in isolation, bitch about how Europeans are terrible people.

This is by no means implying that some people are not assholes and are racist. Idiots are everywhere. I have personally found people to be more accepting of alien cultures in the West. Indians, on the other hand, tend to isolate you horrible if you don't conform to their standard of what being Indian involves.

Another thing Ive noticed, is that as an individual, they have negligible self confidence. No personality or charisma of their own basically. They are more comfortable in groups, (mostly all guys) which is when they are in their element. You will hardly see an Indian going backpacking alone, or even talking to strangers at bars and making new friends (again this is most of them, not all) Really uneasy when alone is what Im trying to say.

This one time at a bar, there was this group of Indian guys (I dint know them) who were being really obnoxious. For sure they were. I was cringing looking at that table for a long time as I was the only other person who knew what they were saying. It was absolute bullshit. Cat-calling women in Hindi and all. They were politely asked to leave and then they created a racism ruckus.

Also this one time this Indian family had booked this bus I was on. Man they were loud as shit, and then made the whole bus smell of fucking achaar. It was disgusting! and there were no windows also. Everybody was so pissed, and they were finally asked to throw it away. The smell stayed for the whole journey. Obviously they will tell their family and friends that it was racism.

Im not denying that there aren't any genuine incidents of racism, but all Im saying is that a lot of them are self-inflicted.

I am a computer science student currently pursuing B. Tech. Today I got to know about the ongoing sale on Durgasoft online courses. 

I was interested in purchasing several courses from there but they end up exceeding my budget. As it is the last day of the sale, I desperately want to buy them.

Is there anyone here who would want to share these courses along with me? We can buy them together if it is possible.

The course material I am interested in are : 

1. Python by Durga sir.

2. Spring Core by Ramesh Sir.

3. Spring Advanced by Ramesh Sir.

3. Hibernate by Ramesh Sir.

4. and Web Services by Ramesh Sir.


Is there any other way I can get these courses for less value. Right now they are available at 50% off with an effective price of INR 4720 each.

Are there any other online courses better than Durgasoft? 

Please help me out here. Any sort of advice regarding this would be appreciated. ",t5_2qh1q,Looking for a partner to buy Durgasoft online course.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b42za6/looking_for_a_partner_to_buy_durgasoft_online/

If it is then which wallet are you using? Will I have to pay for the wallet service, and how can I convert it into any currency like USD or INR (like through PayPal or something).

Also, I just to avoid super interesting questions and suspicions, I earned those bitcoins through this software called [CryptoTab](https://get.cryptobrowser.site/5157331) which is essentially your regular chrome browser other than the fact that it mines bitcoins using my computer's processing skills while I am online. In my few days time with it and the research before that, I think  it is quite safe and definitely legit because when it is mining bitcoins, CPU usage goes as high as 90% but it doesn't slow down my pc either. It just slows down the mining process by reducing the CPU usage to about 30-40% when it detects some other program requires to use the CPU. I can even set the mining speed depending on how much I want it consume of my CPU power. You can get this browser too and start mining bitcoins today :- [https://get.cryptobrowser.site/5157331](https://get.cryptobrowser.site/5157331) . It is supported on both Windows and MacOS.

the fact that even well educated folks from premiere colleges in this country have turned bhakts, 

the whatsapp and social media propaganda which is destroying the minds of the uneducated and undiscerning once and for all,  (Congress has fast joined this bandwagon, but is still lazy as fuck)

the constant and blatant lies, 

the constant ridicule and demonization of  historical stalwarts like Nehru, 

the fear of lynchings, and top it all ministers taking photos with lynchers, 

the fear of getting vyapamed, (though this I am sure happened in Congress time too)

the constant meddling in affair of Delhi government.. (and other non-BJP ones I am sure)

The 5 minutes that I listened to him talk honestly included some of the most cringeworthy and moronic things I've probably ever heard

One of the things that he said was that ""Youngsters criticizing elder BJP statesmen like Modiji"" are by definition, ""anti-nationals"", because the latter have been Indian ""nationals"" since before they were born.
He also said India is going to be in the top 3 biggest economies by 2023 if BJP was voted to power. 

In response to a girl asking him about the lowly 140th place given to India for press freedom and one of the worst scores for human rights in 2017, he said ""We very well know how international institutions have become blatantly anti-hindu and anti-India over the recent years"" and that we may not take their word for it and ended the Q&A segment right after (I'm paraphrasing some parts). 

Also there were instances of him failing to strike seemingly obvious applause lines and would just wait for applause but with very little reaction from the crowd for the first few seconds after which the teachers and others would gradually clap on cue. Like I mentioned, absolute cringefest

The week in which his talk was supposed to be scheduled was also the week of my department fest wherein students and teachers were told to wear a specific colour of clothing for each day of the 5 day fest. And conveniently enough the color assigned on that day was orange and all the teachers wore bright orange silk sarees and they had a bunch of cameramen lurking around at all four corners of the auditorium

Boy do I have stories for you today!

Last week, a Rajya Sabha member was suspended for a day for making ‘unauthorised inane noise’; a controversial amendment was passed which allows foreign funding for political parties; the government of the day tactfully avoided being embarrassed by a new ‘Jumla’; and Big Tobacco fought the Government with Zero Hour Notices.

Let’s get right into it!

#Money Bill strikes again!
___
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a troubled lot. They have an easy majority in Lok Sabha, which allows them to push their bills through, but they don’t have the numbers in Rajya Sabha to do the same. For the past two years, the opposition in the upper house has blocked their legislative agenda through the creative use of their throats and by camping all around the speaker’s grand throne-chair, protesting away to glory. But the Government of the day seems to have a few tricks up its sleeve. They seem to be aiming to completely ignore the upper house by using the [Money Bill route](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/492acw/lets_talk_about_the_new_aadhaar_bill_it_can/). Twice!


The first instance of ‘Operation Money Bill’ was observed on March 11, when the Lok Sabha passed the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016. During the consideration of this bill, many members screamed bloody murder and opposed this legislation being certified as a Money Bill. It went to the Rajya Sabha for recommendations. The bill got passed, 4 days later, on March 16 in its original form. The government of the day seems to have hit Parliament procedure gold. So merely two months later, they decided to do it again.

And this time, it was to bring in FDI in politics!

The Finance Bill 2016 was passed in the Lok Sabha with a clause that did not belong in that legislation, namely, amendments the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA).

___
#BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players
___

The FCRA Amendment is a strange one. Earlier foreign companies were not allowed to make donations to political parties. For obvious reasons. Otherwise entities like Monsanto [would have a field day](http://imgur.com/AsZqfLk). 

The logic being that foreign entities should not be able to influence our Parliament to make laws that favor them. In 2014, both BJP and Congress were found guilty by the Delhi High Court of accepting foreign contributions from UK based company Vedanta. So the government of the day decided to deal with it by making a retrospective amendment to the FCRA act by hiding it within the Finance Bill.

This amendment has cleared Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha has no say in it (because, you know, ‘Operation Money Bill’) and the President’s approval will come soon. Say hello to FDI in Politics.

___
#The Curious Case of Finance Bill, 2016
___
During the debate on the Finance Bill on Wednesday, Asaduddin Owaisi raised a point of order to question the government on the validity of the FCRA amendment. He argued that this act comes under the Home Ministry and amending it through a Finance Bill goes against the provisions of the Constitution. He demanded that the discussion should be suspended immediately since the bill is flawed. 

The decision landed on the lap of deputy speaker of Lok Sabha Arjun Charan Singh, who looked like a dog-lover with a cat in his lap. Unsure what to do. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was away on an official visit to Germany so MoS Jayant Sinha tried to do a [ninja save](http://imgur.com/G9lMcPM). He told Owaisi that Jaitley will respond to his query while replying to the debate.

**[24 hours later](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/e/e8/24_Hours_Later..._.png/revision/latest?cb=20130519222728)**

While giving his reply speech, the Fin Min sort of ignored the FCRA issue. Instead, he spoke about giving funds to the Polavaram Dam. It upset Biju Janata Dal from Orissa enough to stage a rather noisy walkout. The debate ended abruptly and clause by clause on the Finance Bill began. 

Still no word about the point of order despite Owaisi asking the speaker for a ruling.

[Cricket sounds #1](http://imgur.com/DKiZ6Mw)

The Finance Minister had made 49 official amendments to the Finance Bill, so the speaker was going through them one by one. Clause 233, which concerns the controversial FCRA amendment, was clubbed in with Clauses 220 to 230, schedules first to fifteen and passed together.

[Cricket sounds #2](http://imgur.com/wn6P3Mv)

After the clause by clause consideration was completed, the speaker gave a ruling to Owaisi’s point of order and denied it. Ignoring protests from some members, she called for the passage of the bill.

[Cricket sounds #3](http://imgur.com/JxBvCE6)

Not a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha. 

The Finance Minister be like [#EpicWin](http://img.memecdn.com/epic-win_o_834502.gif).

#The ‘Jumla’ that escaped
___
Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad raised the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) issue in Rajya Sabha. Jairam Ramesh has written about this extensively in The Hindu ( [Part 1](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/jairam-ramesh-on-the-krishna-godavari-basin-scam/article8486493.ece) & [Part 2](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-article-by-jairam-ramesh-on-the-kg-basin-scam-part-ii/article8533360.ece) ). 
To give you a short rundown of this ‘Jumla’, in 2005 GSPC claimed that the KG Basin had an epic deposit of natural gas worth an estimated Rs. 2,20,000 crore. They spent Rs 19,700 crore over a period of a decade for ‘gas exploration’ but did not get even a tiny whiff of the sweet sweet hydrocarbon gas mixture. Five CAG reports over the past five years have pointed out discrepancies in the way GSPC operated. The Congress has been dying to dig deep into this issue and they finally did it in Rajya Sabha. They took out their shovels, ready to break the earth while singing merry songs of victory.

But then, they struck a rock called Arun Jaitley even before they started digging.

Jaitley told Azad that this issue cannot be raised in Parliament because the [Public Accounts Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee_(India) (PAC) is already examining it. The PAC is a committee of selected members of Parliament, constituted by the Parliament of India, for the auditing of the revenue and the expenditure of the Government of India. The house cannot deliberate on matters that a Parliamentary committee is already deliberating. 

___
#Rule 255: Kick the disrupter
___
Rajya Sabha was yet again disrupted at the beginning of the week over the Agusta Westland issue. Members trooped into the well, shouting garbled slogans against the Government. Then, Rule 255 happened. 

> “The Chairman may direct any member whose conduct is in his opinion grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from the Council and any member so ordered to withdraw shall do so forthwith and shall absent himself during the remainder of the day's meeting.” [Source](http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rs_rule/generalrulesproc.asp)

Hamid Ansari, Chairman of Rajya Sabha invoked this rule and ordered Sukhendu Roy of the TMC to be removed from the upper house for a day. Roy was seen standing at his seat and demanding (very loudly) to know who benefitted from the Agusta Westland scam. 

Here’s an excerpt from the debate:

[""Please stop making inane noise""](http://imgur.com/JQhbrjq)

[""Please stop talking... or else""](http://imgur.com/vl0UVaB)

[""RULE 255 BITCHES!!! GTFO!""](http://imgur.com/v3kMrpA)

After the Sukhendu Roy left, taking his ‘unauthorized inane noise’ with him, the Congress continued its valiant attempt to stall the proceedings in the house. Nitin Gadkari, visibly upset, requested Ansari to smite them with his awesome legal powers and invoke 255 on all of them. Ansari pointed out that Rule 255 applies only to individual members and cannot be enforced en masse.

[Obama... I mean... Ansari out!](http://giphy.com/gifs/obama-mic-drop-out-3o7qDLkrKr034Z3hQI)

#Big Tobacco vs Unhealthy Lung pictures
___
There have been three zero hour notices raised in the Lok Sabha this session regarding increasing health warnings on tobacco products to 85%. To give you some context, the government had passed an order in 2014 which mandated tobacco manufacturers to show gruesome pictures of decaying lungs that cover up to 85% of the product packet. 

The pictures would dissuade new smokers from taking up the deadly cause and it has been proven to be quite effective in many countries around the world. This order was to come into force on April 1 this year and there has been a battle raging between the Tobacco industry and the government on the sidelines. /u/dextermilburn has been talking about ITC shutting down and opening factories [in his posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4inj30/last_week_in_indian_economy_for_the_week_ending/) for a few weeks now. The Parliament also became a stage where this battle is being fought by filing notices in favor and against the government’s move.

Last week on May 3rd, Baijayant Panda raised a zero hour notice supporting the government’s move to increase the warning size. He urged the government to hold its ground on increasing health warnings and to implement its order diligently. 

On 27th April, two other members had raised a notice to oppose the government’s move, namely R Dhruvanarayana and Sharadkumar Bansode. Both of these members spoke about how tobacco farmers and beedi manufacturers will be adversely affected if these warnings are imposed. They wanted the government to consider the plight of the farmers connected to the industry and not impose the order.

Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court had a hearing where upheld the Government’s 2014 order and asked Tobacco companies to implement it.

**What is a Zero Hour and why is it important?**

‘Zero Hour’ refers to a time period in the Parliament when members can raise matters of urgent public importance to bring it to the notice of the government of the day. Every day when the Parliament is in session, there is one hour allotted to raise such notices. A member is required to file the notice in Parliament before 9 a.m. on the same day. A ballot takes place in which notices are randomly selected and are allowed to be raised. In Lok Sabha, the Zero hour usually happens from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and in Rajya Sabha, it happens from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. It’s upto the speakers in both houses to decide the time slot of the zero hour, depending on how heavy the legislative business is.

The Zero hour is easily one of the most ignored aspect of our Parliamentary process. It a perfect way to judge what is on the minds of our elected representatives. For instance, in the past two weeks numerous notices were raised on the water crisis and drought situation in the country. Considering that these notices are randomly selected through a ballot, the sheer volume points towards the fact that this crisis is bigger and badder than we imagine.

**RBI Drops Rates Like They’re Hot**

After four interest rate decreases in the past one year, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates by 0.25% again to a more than [5-year](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-repo-rates-decision-idINKCN0X20C1) low of 6.5%. This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy.


**Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol**

Heartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever. The state has decided to go the route of Gujarat, Nagaland and Manipur to completely ban all sales of [alcohol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales) (you didn’t know it was banned in Nagaland and Manipur as well, did you?). The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company.

**One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure**

Indian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress? Only time will tell.

**Are Diamonds Forever?**

That’s the question the government is asking itself as it prepares to end its legal monopoly over diamond mining in India. After the first ever auction of a gold mine in February, which was won by Vedanta Ltd. ([VEDL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AVEDL&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), India is gearing up to do the same again and auction its first [ever](http://www.vccircle.com/news/infrastructure/2016/04/05/after-gold-india-set-its-first-diamond-mine-auction) diamond mine. The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.

**Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers**

In Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well. For Amitabh Bachchan though, this just negates all the good PR that the *do boond zindagi ke* polio campaign brought him. As for you, see if you can even point to where Panama is on a globe.

###Scumbag journalist: 

###Writes article saying ""Do the math"". Does no math.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

>The 508km-long Mumbai to Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) is scheduled for completion in December 2023, but commencement date has been sought to be advanced to August 2022.

>Initially, each high speed train will have 10 cars and the capacity to accommodate 750 people, The Times of India said. It will increase to 16 cars that will accommodate 1,200 people.

>According to initial estimates, around 1.6 crore people are expected to travel by the bullet train annually. By 2050, around 1.6 lakh commuters should travel by the high-speed train on a daily basis.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

1446914505.0,6,73,15,"The trend right now is to continuously harp on certain shortcomings and create an environment of negativity about Bengal. And it's shocking how the ones who leave Bengal are busy bad-mouthing the state the most. That actually causes a very negative perception about it.

Contrary to the prevalent perception, the Bengal govt has done a significant amount of work in the last 4 years. Lets talk about them first.

->Growth:

i) Gross Value Added- India is growing at 7.5 percent while West Bengal is growing at 10.48 percent 

ii) Agriculture- India is growing at 1.1 percent, West Bengal is growing at 6.46 percent 

iii) Industries - India 5.6 percent, West Bengal 8.34 percent 

iv) Services- India 10.9 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent

v) Per Capita Income - India 6.1 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent.

These are as per statistics of the Central Statistical Organisation.

-> Investment Proposals:

i) Since TMC came to office, Rs 84,923 crore of investments are either completed or in process.

ii) In the Bengal Global Business Summit, Rs 2,43,000 crore of investment proposals are tabled and work has already started on the Rs 91000 crore within the last five months. 

iii) Changi airport has come to West Bengal creating the first ever with BAPL private sector greenfield airport in India, nobody talks about that. What is interesting is 1800 acres around the airport - 56 percent of which will have to be non-polluting industry is going to come up there, transforming that entire area as an Aerotropolis. 

iv) SAIL is already implementing on a promised Rs 16000 crore investment in the state and has now promised another Rs 40000 crore of investment. 

v) Anil Ambani's group is investing in cement. 

vi) Tata Metaliks has asked for expansion of its plant. 

vii) NTPC is coming up with two more power plants,work has already started on those. 

viii) TCS is almost ready with a new campus bringing in 20000 new jobs. Cognizant and Wipro have announced 5000 and 2400 new jobs respectively. 

ix) Wipro has started work on the construction of a new campus already. 

x) The largest Software Technology Park of India (STPI) is coming up in Kolkata for a Rs 100 crore investment. 

xi) Caparro Group has committed to investing in a small car manufacturing hub in Bengal,land has already been bought.

xii) Bengal Birbhum Coalfields, the newly formed company in which Bengal has the largest share, could well be a game changer for the industry-starved state.The company will develop Deocha Pachami, the country's largest mineable coal block, which happens to be in West Bengal's Birbhum district. 

xiii)Chinese bus manufacturing company Zhongtong has decided to set up an assembling unit at the airport city in Burdwan's Andal. The company has proposed to invest Rs 250 crore in the first phase and scale it up to Rs 1,500 crore. Zhongtong plans to manufacture buses in Andal later. 

xiv) Mahindra & Mahindra is investing 150 crores in Kharagpur.

->Finance Hub

Setting up a greenfield Finance Hub is a real tough thing. BKC took 3 decades to get built. Bangalore tried this. It failed. GIFT Tried this. In spite of ""Brand Gujarat"" and PR skills of Modi, it has failed to attract as many investors as New Town Finance Hub attracted. Getting 19 national level Financial Institutions commit investment by buying land at 13 crore / acre in a time span of 4 years is just AMAZING boss..
Is the Media ever coming up with these news? Even if they are coming up, they are portraying these things in negative light telling how many plots are yet to be sold.

->Tourism:

i) We know what traffic Darjeeling was receiving before TMC came. If you want check the pre-2011 statistics of Bagdogra Airport. Annual traffic was around 2-3 Lakhs. Last year (2015 March) it reached the mark of 1 million air passengers / year. in 2011, Bimal Gurung and his gang was creating trouble almost every other day through Bandhs and stuffs like that. Do we hear of those things now? That was MB's diplomacy and political shrewdness .

ii) Jangalmahal: It was a Naxalite den. Today we have several tourism initiatives happening there , tourists are visiting those places in good numbers. Bengalis love to roam around. They are getting new places to visit in WB itself. Tourism industry ( hotels and cottages) does not require much land and generates a lot of blue-collar employment in the form of drivers, stewards, cooks, guides,etc.

That's what a good administration was supposed to deliver.

->Financial Improvement

i) In 2010-11 (March 2011), debt-GDP ratio was 40%. In March 2015, it was 33%. 

ii) WB Govt own tax Revenue in March 2011: 21,000 crore WB Govt own tax Revenue in March 2015: 41,000 crore 

iii) Capital investment in state budget ( investment in creation of physical assets i.e. Roads, Bridges, irrigation canals,etc) increased by more than 500% in 4 years.

Does media ever report these incidents?

iv)Revenue Doubling happened at a time when oil prices crashed and state govt's tax collection on petrol and diesel got severely impacted.

Don't you think these show better administrative skills?

->Kanyashree Programme and Fair Price Medicine Shops

Similar models are getting implemented across many states at all-India level now. We know the good points of these schemes.This is a unique example where United Nations is now saying 53 developing countries who met in London must adopt the Kanyashree program.

->Revival of State PSUs

i)Only three states have discoms that are profitable (without subsidies) - West Bengal, Goa and Maharastra - according to the Planning Commission. 

ii) Transport PSUs were sucking up hundreds of crores of subsidy every year. Daily earnings of CSTC in 2011: 20 lakhs Daily earnings of CSTC in 2015: 30 lakhs

Now almost all the transport PSUs are profitable.

iii) Loss making Tantuja and Manjusha is profitable now. So is the newly launched Biswa Bangla Brand. It's not just about profit of these PSUs. More Profitable these companies are, more weavers, craftsmen, handloom workers can benefit from these platforms by getting more orders and earning more money. More direct as well as indirect employment is generated. Also , these profits form ""non-tax revenue"" of state budget, which helps in more capital investment.

Again, is the Media ever highlighting these things?

->FAILURES

The major failure has been in generating white collar jobs ( Both in IT and Manufacturing). And this happened because they did not market ""Brand Bengal"" well. Not giving SEZ Permission was perhaps the most stupid decision ever.

But Media is continuously highlighting these stuffs only. In 5 years, there has been only 2 Foreign Trips by MB and Media is complaining. On the Contrary, MB and her bureaucrats should have made several trips to Silicon Valley and should have tried to incentivize more Hi-Tech Companies to establish R&D Centres in Kolkata.

->BOTTOMLINE:

Every State has its own problems.

Do people in Bangalore always complain about broken roads? Do people in Gujarat always complain why GIFT could never become a success in almost 9 years or why Ahmedabad could never become a big IT Hub?

No....Boss....No

1438254466.0,6,6,2,"Already posted in relationships but need some Indian prospective. 
Hello everyone. I am 28 years male and I have been married for 4 years now. I am from northern India from a small village. but I got married to Aussie girl who was 18 at time of marriage.My parents live in India while I am in Australia from 8 years. 
I am pouring my heart out please don't mind the Grammer or long post. 


 To start with it was very well. We got together love blossom she had bad childhood memories coz of divorce between her mum and dad and she never talked to her dad. she wanted to marry someone who would not leave her ever. I told about my cultures where marriages do last longer and since it was my 3rd gf and first serious one so we got married despite sharp reaction from her side and my family also worrying about society. However I told her that in 5 years  I do want to return back to India and settle permanently she agreed. We 2 didn't care about anyone got married  after few hiccups especially her father threaten to kill me and destroy the marriage.  she moved in she was 18 I was 24 at that time. I did got residency on basis of this relationship but i wasn't fooling or using her to get this thing. We did trip to India together with her mother and step father and friends in 2012  got married in big fat Indian wedding style. She loved the experience of India. We were happy things were great she started to learn cultures got job in Indian restaurant to have better understanding of India. My family love her and I m proud of her to this date

Problems started with I realising she was getting lazy when we came back after 1 month around this time period she wouldn't show much interest in cooking we were living in shared house I tool responility of financial aspect worked hard like most Indians do 6 days a week. I later find out she was going clubbing and meeting other guys while I was at work. She cheated on me that's what I feel when she hide things from me. I got upset but I wanted her and got carried away by tears and I saw from her view point that she is young and need adventure and teenage partying thing. I trusted her words and we moved to new place as I fought with my roommates regarding some other issues. I could only manage a old house which was close to my job although she wanted to move closer to her mum but due to 3 hours drive from my work every day we rejected the thought. 

In 2014 I got permanent residency we went to india again for my sisters marriage she was 6 months pregnant. This time also she enjoyed there getting loved by all my family and she is proud of my family we like to show her off and other people are jealous. 1month later on return I started missing my friends and family more. Tears in my mother's eyes and she wanting me not to leave have impact on me bit due to some financial issues I have to return. I had built a new house in the city. Had few investments and we wanted to run a business some day most likely bakery because my wife love to bake and or open a dance school some day. She did left school b4 wedding She wanted to be teacher I supported her and got her in college where she finished year 12.all this time I only worked so all financial department was mine. 

Her step father got diagnosed with parkisons disease in 2012 and in September 2014 she asked me it's better if she move to her mum so she could care her during pregnancy as it's closer to hospital and she can look after her step dad while mum works. I respected that and agreed. Now that's where problem started me working random shifts but agreed to see her every weekend. In between we had fights where I wanted her to move in with me and she used same excuse that she need to be there. 
In January she gave birth to beautiful daughter I was casual at work still I took 2 weeks off taking care of baby. After that she still stayed at mums didn't want to move in coz of unhygienic conditions in bathroom coz its old. 

I wanted to settle down but again she wanted house around her mother's side I got 6 days permanent job so I couldn't travel everyday from mum s house. We chose a land near my work and paid deposit. I worked whole night in morning she would visit once fortnight to go look at display houses There was issues with house designs and we resolved by adding what we both want. 

Now I wanted her to move in with me coz I can't travel every weekend either. And her step dad died. She always said she is staying away because of being caring him.  I was sharing house with two other guys and she isn't happy with condition of bathroom and cleanliness but mind u she never try to clean the house herself even her dishes and stuff I have to nag her and write a list so she could do which is what she used to do with her mum. She started to get depressed and went to psychologist regarding her step father passing grieving. She invited me too. Personally being raised in country where I haven't seen so much fuck given about these issues solved with help of psychologist. We went now I got big surprise she hardly told me this but in front of her psychologist she said she has been feeling small, useless and fat and ugly . she lost her friends after baby she is lonely and  Although she did gain lot of weight. Again I put few points in my defense and counter arguments like I m working my arse off while she is just spending while staying away from me. Then psychologist told us we need counselling which I didn't agree. I felt I did  sacrifices like she did too leaving friends and family for love to be together there are some cultural aspects which makes it harder in communicating what I meant and what she make of it. My jokes she doesn't find them funny. 



Fast forward in June she came over with promise she would stay permanent after I did some repairs to house but  stayed a week with baby then she had excuses that she booked appointments for baby and her driving lessons at mum s place so she want to go back. Despite my only hope that now we would stay together she wanted to go back again which pissed me off eneded up in fight she gone back. She has planned with her mum to go out long weekend on romantic place she wanted us to go and she would move in after this. I was very very excited so 4 of us our 6months baby me wife and her mom. She said she want me to forget everything and just make her feel happy for these two days. I didn't knew what was coming we hardly ever talked as she hinted me we could talk her moving with me after trip which was like no in my head. So whole mood was off during this trip. On last day she told me with 😢 tears that she won't be moving ever and she is breaking up with me. I expected her saying no to moving but breakup was big thing. Although in past I have said so many times to her to breakup while in anger and she would cry to that but I forget after fights and treated like it's normal. I m realising now how big of fool I was. 

She is changed now totally switched off no feelings for me she want me to visit see daughter once a week or have relationship with daughter only not her. My heart is bleeding I am feeling suicidal. Can't talk with my friends about this in detail not with my parents either. I am realising now I have not lived up to mark as husband and I should have listened and done things but finances and responsibilities of sisters marriage and other stuff put lot off stress on me. I have been depressed for ages. She is agreed to marriage counselling which is in two weeks. Her birthday is on 31st  I want to surprise her and see her while she visit her friends she doesn't want anything b4 counselling. I am agreed to move into new house although it's just 12months when our house will be ready. Ready to change shifts from night to Morning. 


So my issue now is I am confused 
I wasn't  a better husband now option is to be better father like she wants me to but without her in my life which I don't want to do. I want either whole family of us together or nothing 
Or to be better son cancel the land deal don't take huge loan and spend my life paying it off  and  I want to move to India some day she said she doesn't know if she will now. Also her mum and sister putting words in her ears and making her against me. 

I want to repair my mistakes show her that I do care and love her the way she wants. I fear our relationship will. Never be the same and she would always give me threats of I ever did or expect even normal things like food while I come from work or other expectations of she taking care of herself. now at this stage I need to be clear in one direction not to get confused or hanging between India and Australia or parents and friends or wife and kid. I would be much better if this would get clear. Please give some advice or thought as I don't have western thinking experience. I am trying to change myself to be better person.

###Headline Stories
***

**Pandering To The Base**

Every politician does it. From the Donald in the US to Modi in India, it’s a political science lesson that crosses borders. As much as we parade the “developing-nation” tag around, India’s economy is still heavily dependant on agriculture as it employs almost two-thirds of the nation’s people. And these farmers also constitute Modi’s base and naturally, his government needs to pander to them before the forth-coming state elections. After a union budget that was largely seen as pro-farmer by earmarking almost $826 million (₹5,524 crore) for crop insurance plans, the government might play two more cards to appease the backbone of the economy. One, officials said last week that they are considering imposing a [penalty](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-crop-insurance-idUSL3N16U22P) on delaying of claim settlements for crop insurance. That’s when you buy insurance and if the rains don’t come in and your crops fail, you get paid a settlement. Two, the government is likely to extend the the current 25% wheat import tax which expires in March to continue [beyond](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-wheat-duty-idINKCN0WN1H7) March. The tax was imposed to shield domestic wheat farmers from cheap imports. Wasn’t exactly effective since wheat output in 2015 was down 10% from 2014, despite the tax.


**The Great Indian Addiction**

Indian people are addicted. It’s not a drug, gambling or internet addiction. It’s an addiction to gold. Gold imports make up a quarter of India’s trade deficit because we import almost 10 lakh kgs of gold annually. Billionaire Warren Buffett says about gold: “It doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you.”  Clearly, Indian people think that Buffett uncle doesn’t know anything about gold. Rehabilitating the Indian people from this addiction can be hard but the government is trying. Recently, it introduced a 1% excise duty on imported gold jewellry. How did that go down? Jewellers went on an indefinite strike which was called off last week after [assurances](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-strike-idINKCN0WM01T) that excise department officials won’t harass jewellers. The government also started a campaign to monetize the privately owned horde of Indian gold to cut down on imports. How has that worked out? The scheme only managed to attract 0.015% of the estimated horde of gold that is currently in family lockers and temple vaults. There was some golden news on that front last week as the iconic 200-year-old [Siddhivinayak](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-siddhihvinayak-temple-idINKCN0WK1ZF) temple in Mumbai announced its participation in the scheme.

**Because Karma Is A Bitch**

Petty sabotage and backstabbing isn’t just limited to undercover spies and Indian politics anymore. The corporates are adopting these strategies as well. Last week, Uber filed a lawsuit at the Delhi High Court against its biggest Indian competitor, Ola. The lawsuit accuses Ola of creating 90,000 fake Uber accounts and using them to book over 400,000 rides, only to be cancelled at the last [moment](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/23/11292310/uber-ola-lawsuit-india-fake-rides-lyft). Classic prank by Ola, right? Except Uber claims that Ola did this to disrupt its operations and frustrate its drivers. And Uber would know that because it has been accused of doing the exact same thing to its biggest US competitor, Lyft. Two years ago, Lyft accused Uber of booking and cancelling over 5,000 rides using fake accounts that were traced back to Uber employees. If true, Ola will only have taken a page from Uber’s own playbook. If you’re a betting person, be sure to put your money on Uber - that company’s got deep pockets and can drag this out as long as it takes. It recently declared $1 billion (₹6,688 crore) in annual profits from it’s [top 30](http://www.newsweek.com/uber-profits-elsewhere-support-sustainable-spending-china-ceo-440705) cities alone. To be fair, they also said they were sustaining huge losses in China where the company holds a 30% market share.

**Auto Engines Are The New Moon Landing**

69th Richest Indian on the famous Forbes Rich-list and the co-founder of Infosys, Nandan Nilekani is known for investing in startups that focus on big, transformative ideas. In his investment portfolio is Team Indus, a company that aims to land a rover on the moon and Systemantics, a company that focuses on robots. Last week, Nilekani made his [biggest](http://thetechportal.in/2016/03/24/sedemac-mechatronics-funding/) startup investment yet in a company called Sedemac Mechatronics. What’s bigger than futuristic robots and landing on the moon? Time travel, perhaps? No, apparently, it’s building small engines and powertrains for auto companies. Nilekani led the latest round of funding in Sedemac which summed up to a total of $7.5 million (₹50 crore). Sedemac counts the big boys of the auto industry like Tata Motors, Mahindra Group, Ashok Leyland as its clients and was started by an engineering professor at IIT-B with a couple of fellow IITians.

**The Chinese Dragon Wants In On India**

The “Big Three” of e-commerce in India - Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon - will soon become the “Big Four” with the entry of Alibaba, the chinese e-commerce giant in India. Officials from the company that is poised to [surpass](http://www.businessinsider.in/Alibaba-on-course-to-become-worlds-top-retailer/articleshow/51507633.cms) the world’s biggest retailer, Walmart and claim that tag for itself, said last week that Alibaba was looking to expand its presence in India. It is looking to directly enter the online retail segment later this year. Run by China’s richest person, Jack Ma, the company already owns 40% of Paytm and 4% of Snapdeal. Are Indian e-commerce companies coming together like brothers-in-arms to fight off competition from this foreign entity? Of course no. The Indians didn’t unite when the British literally invaded and aren’t going to do that now with the Chinese either. In fact, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal and his Snapdeal counterpart Kunal Bahl already found themselves in a war of words on [Twitter](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/flipkart-s-sachin-bansal-takes-jibe-at-alibaba-s-india-entry-116032600040_1.html) over Alibaba’s planned expansion in India. Alibaba, which still conjures images of forty thieves in one’s imagination, may tie up with the [Tatas](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-21/news/71705366_1_digital-india-alibaba-group-chairman-cyrus-mistry) to launch its online retail business as a joint-venture. This is because FDI regulations still don’t allow foreign companies to sell directly to Indian consumers, which is what Alibaba wants to do. Amazon, the US ambassador to the industry, merely connects buyers and sellers and doesn’t sell itself.

**Oli Gets Oil**

Nepal’s Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli recently took a trip up north to Beijing and stumbled his way into signing an agreement with China for the supply of petroleum products to [Nepal](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-nepal-idUSKCN0WP1WV). The country, which serves as a strategic buffer between India and China, adopted its first post-monarchy constitution last year. But protesters opposing the new constitution blocked trucks carrying fuel and essential goods coming from India. This five-month long “unofficial blockade” of Nepal had disastrous consequences for the Nepalese economy due to its overwhelming dependence on India. The distraught country says it now wants to import 33% of Nepal’s fuel from China in the future. Basically, after being deeply hurt by what the Indians did, Nepal is now looking for some quick rebound action from the Chinese. Indian officials, however, are far from alarmed that Nepal is trying to move away from the Indian sphere of influence. Why? Because there is this big huge chunk of rock called the Himalayas between Nepal and China.

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

1496556903.0,6,29,40,"Bitcoin currently has grown so much in size that its market cap is bigger than any of USA's top airlines. Yes, these are Airlines like Delta with hundred's and hundreds of Boeing airplanes in their fleet connecting every city of America yet a simple technology run on a computer has usurped all these airlines. No mean feat. 

Australia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming. 

Meanwhile Indian Gov is actively trying to play down BTC, some ministers are still calling it scam, play of the devil, likening it with ""chit funds"" etc. What the fuck is wrong with the finance brains and the IT brains of our country that we (as a country) are missing out on the biggest IT development since world wide web thanks to illiterates talking their talk. 

And Im not talking about middle men like ""Zebpay"" and ""Unocoin"" - Bitcoin was invented to cut these middlemen out of the chain, yet these are the ones who are profiting selling BTC to Indians at a 25% markup price and taking a hefty commission. 

We are also giving a big play to more middle men companies like PayTM who are trying to reinvent the currency wheel and are doing such a bad job at it, yet most Indians will tell you that PAYTM is the best and Bitcoin is a scam. Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them - yet PAYTM is such a big rage here - outdated technology, very poor profitablity, the PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm.


Make no mistake, India will follow the rest of the world eventually, as we always do, and end up accepting BTC in 2020, but by that time the world would have already moved on and derived the most out of bitcoin. Many businesses are already hedging their funds vs BTC or investing part of their profits into BTC and the growth of 2500% since 2015 will only make more companies turn to BTC.

1513290195.0,6,8,9,"Amazing logic indeed. This is a crazy world! Interesting article written by an Indian Economist

Japanese save a lot. They do not spend much. Also, Japan exports far more than it imports. Has an annual trade surplus of over 100 billion. Yet Japanese economy is considered weak, even collapsing.

Americans spend, save little. Also US imports more than it exports.
Has an annual trade deficit of over $400 billion. Yet, the American economy is considered strong and trusted to get stronger.

But where from do Americans get money to spend? They borrow from Japan, China and even India.
Virtually others save for the US to spend. Global savings are mostly invested in US, in dollars.

India itself keeps its foreign currency assets of over $50 billion in US securities. China has sunk over $160 billion in US securities.
Japan's stakes in US securities is in trillions.

Result:
The US has taken over $5 trillion from the world. So, as the world
saves for the US - It's The Americans who spend freely. Today, to keep the US consumption going, that is for the US economy to work, other
countries have to remit $180 billion every quarter, which is $2
billion a day, to the US!

A Chinese economist asked a neat question. Who has invested more, US in China, or China in US? The US has invested in China less than half of what China has invested in US.

The same is the case with India. It have invested in US over $50
billion. But the US has invested less than $20 billion in India.

Why the world is after US?

The secret lies in the American spending, that they hardly save. In fact they use their credit cards to spend their future income. That the US spends is what makes it attractive to export to the US. So US imports more than what it exports year after year.

The result:

The world is dependent on US consumption for its growth. By its deepening culture of consumption, the US has habituated the world to
feed on US consumption. But as the US needs money to finance its consumption, the world provides the money.

It's like a shopkeeper providing the money to a customer so that the customer keeps buying from the shop. If the customer will not buy, the shop won't have business, unless the shopkeeper funds him. The US is like the lucky customer. And the world is like the helpless shopkeeper
financier.

Who is America's biggest shopkeeper financier? Japan of course. Yet it's Japan which is regarded as weak. Modern economists complain that
Japanese do not spend, so they do not grow. To force the Japanese to spend, the Japanese government exerted itself, reduced the savings
rates, even charged the savers. Even then the Japanese did not spend (habits don't change, even with taxes, do they?). Their traditional postal savings alone is over $1.2 trillion. Thus, savings, far from being the strength of Japan, has become its pain.

Hence, what is the lesson?

That is, a nation cannot grow unless the people spend, not save. Not just spend, but borrow and spend.
Dr. Jagdish Bhagwati, the famous Indian-born economist in the US, told Manmohan Singh that Indians wastefully save. Ask them to spend, on imported cars and, seriously, even on cosmetics! This will put India on a growth curve. This is one of the reason for MNC's coming down to India, seeing the consumer spending.

This is not a comprehensive list (you can find a comprehensive list by /u/yogesh_calm [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/podcasts). While lists like that are great to have, it's hard to figure out whether a particular podcast is worth listening to. So here I have tried to include some notes about the podcast and recommend a particular episode as well.

1491491104.0,6,1,12,"""India is heading for a Revolution

India is inevitably heading for a revolution. Why do I say so ? Let me explain

India is potentially a highly developed country, but actually a poor and backward country.

It is potentially a highly developed country because it has two of the basic requirements to be a highly developed country, viz. a huge pool of technical talent, and immense natural resources.

This was not the position in 1947 when India became independent. The British policy was broadly to keep India backward, feudal and largely unindustrialized, so that Indian industry may not emerge as a big rival to British industry. So we were not permitted by our British rulers to set up a heavy industrial base, but were permitted only some light industries like textiles, plantations, etc which, too, for a long time were mainly under British ownership. So till 1947 we had very few industries and very few engineers

The position today in 2017 is very different. Today we have a heavy industrial base, and a huge pool of competent engineers, technicians, scientists, managers, etc. Our I.T. engineers are manning Silicon Valley in California, and American Universities are full of our our mathematics and science professors.

In addition, we have immense natural wealth. India is not a small country like England or Japan. It is almost a continent.

So we have all that is required to be a first rate modern, highly developed country, like North America or Europe.

And yet the reality is that we are an underdeveloped, poor country, with massive unemployment, malnourishment, lack of healthcare, good education, etc for our masses.

We can consider some facts :

1. the level of unemployment can be gathered from two facts (a) 1 crore ( 10 million ) youth are entering the Indian job market every year, but only 1.4 lac ( 140, 000 ) jobs are being created every year in the organized sector of the Indian economy. So where do the remaining 9.86 million youth go ? They become hawkers, street vendors, bouncers, criminals, the girls often become prostitutes, and many end up as suicides. In 2015 the U.P. govt. advertised 358 jobs of peons ( chaprasis, i.e. class 4 employees ) for which there were 23 lac ( 2.3 million ) applications. 250 of the applicants had Ph.D. degrees, 2500 were M.Sc., M.B.A. engineers, etc all begging for a [peon's job](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/phd-holders-among-23-lakh-applicants-for-peon-jobs-in-up/story-OqHzHbvo16gUN2DfTkfYlI.html). Something similar happened when police constable's jobs were advertised in Madhya Pradesh, and peon's jobs in West Bengal

2. 50% Indian children are malnourished., which is a situation far worse than in sub Saharan countries of Africa like Somalia. A [UNICEF](http://unicef.in/Story/1124/Nutrition) report says that one out every [three malnourished child in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition_in_India) is an [Indian child](https://www.savethechildren.in/resource-centre/articles/malnutrition-in-india-statistics-state-wise).

3. Poor people in India have hardly any access to healthcare. There are no doubt some excellent hospitals in big cities of India, but they are exorbitantly expensive. Poor patients simply cannot afford good doctors. AIIMS, ( All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, ) looks like a railway station, with thousands of people sitting there, and no one caring for them, unless one is rich or powerful.. So where do the poor people go when they fall sick ? They go to quacks. Quackery is rampant in India.

4. The govt. spends a huge amount of money on I.I.T.s and elite institutions like JNU, but hardly anything for primary schools in villages, where the foundation of knowledge is laid.

5. [57 individuals in India control 70% of India's wealth](http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-interviews-blog/57-billionaires-control-70-of-indias-wealth-india-is-second-most-unequal-economy-after-russia/)

6. Far from there being any 'vikas', the Indian economy is lying stagnant, with chances of genuine growth remote. Whatever 'growth there has been has only benefited a handful of crony capitalists, but not the Indian masses.

According to Mark Twain, there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. Statistics is such a wonderful thing that with its help one can manufacture any figure one wants, like a conjuror pulling a rabbit out of a hat.

The latest figures given by the government of India authorities claiming 7.9 percent growth in GDP in the last quarter is an excellent example, and reminds one of Lord Haw Haw (William Joyce), or the Nazi propaganda minister, Dr Goebbels, who kept proclaiming on radio to the German people right till the very end that Germany was winning the Second World War – when in fact it was losing.

According to this claim, the Indian economy is the fastest growing economy of the world, outstripping the growth in GDP of the Chinese economy, which grew by only 6.9 percent in the same period. Evidently, according to this figure, we are heading for an El Dorado some time in the future, and as Dr Pangloss would say (see Voltaire’s ‘Candide’ ), quoting the German philosopher Leibniz, this is the best of all possible worlds.
But a scrutiny of these figures throws up several doubts. Are the figures true or dressed up, like a Potemkin village? Also, assuming they are true, is this GDP growth benefiting the Indian masses, or only a handful of big businessmen?

Exports have fallen from $187.29 billion in the period April -October 2014, to $156.29 billion in the period April-October 2015, ie a drop of 17.6 percent. So if exports have fallen, and manufacturing has grown by 9 percent, as claimed by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, where have the increased quantity of goods manufactured been sold? In the home market?

But India is a poor country, with 80 percent people holding little purchasing power. And with the sharp escalation in food prices, real incomes have really gone down.

According to the statement of Raghuram Rajan, the RBI governor, most factories are running at 70 percent of their capacity, while in 2011-2012 they were running at 80 percent of their capacity. This apparently shows manufacturing decline, rather than growth. According to a Business Standard report, corporate profitability is below one percent on an average.

Bad loans by banks continue to mount. According to CARE, non-performing assets during July-September, 2015 stood at about Indian Rs3.37 lac crore, an increase of Indian Rs71,000 crore. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, the number of stalled projects – the bulk of them in the manufacturing and infrastructure sectors – went up. Small and medium enterprises are having a difficult time trying to survive. The real-estate sector, which provides a lot of jobs, is down in the dumps, with construction of new buildings going down, and the number of unsold homes going up.

An article by Andy Mukherjee published by Reuters states that the GDP growth of the Indian economy is one third a statistical mirage, and real GDP growth is more likely to be about 5 percent rather than 7.4 percent as claimed by the Indian authorities. Mukherjee says:

>“The illusion comes from a recent supposed improvement in the way India calculates its Gross Domestic Product. In theory, Indian authorities claim that Indian GDP is close to international standards. In practice it has become utterly unreliable.”

What is the real GDP growth of the Indian economy? [Breakingviews.com](https://www.breakingviews.com/) answered that question by looking at three indicators: corporate earnings, auto sales and imports of computer software (since retained earnings finance new investment projects, auto sales are a proxy for consumer demand while software imports reflect productivity gains). Mixing the three in a simple index suggests that growth in the most recent quarter was closer to 5 percent.

But let us assume that the 7.9 percent figure is correct. The further question that still remains is: is this GDP growth benefiting the Indian masses, or just a handful of big businessmen? Is the rich-poor divide growing? Dilip Shanghvi, Gautam Adani, Mukesh Ambani, Aziz Premji, Pallonji Mistry, etc are worth billions of dollars, while the majority of Indians are struggling to make both ends meet, as prices of food soar.

What has happened to the slogan ‘sab ka saath, sab ka vikas’? It seems it was only a ‘jumla’. The communal fire is being stoked up again in UP and elsewhere. When there is an economic crisis which the govt. cannot resolve, it resorts to fascist methods, as it happened in Germany and Italy with the rise to power of Hitler and Mussolini

India stands at 135th in human development out of the approximately 200 countries in the world. For more on [this](http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2014/jul/25/India-Ranks-135th-in-Human-Development-Index-639966.html)

To abolish all this, and raise the standard of living of our people – that must be the goal of all patriotic modern minded people--. we have to create a modern, highly industrialised country in which all our citizens are getting decent lives.
But what has this government done in this direction? The answer is: a big zero, and only jumlas and dramas.
The test of every government or system is one – and only one: is the standard of living of the masses rising under it or not? If not, the government or system is a failure. From this standpoint (and it is the only correct standpoint), the Modi government, like the previous Manmohan Singh govt., is a total failure on all fronts
The question naturally arises that when we have all that is required to be a first rate highly developed country, why is India still poor and backward ?
The answer is that apart from the two requirements to become a highly developed country mentioned above, viz. a huge pool of technical talent, and huge natural resources, there is also a third requirement, which unfortunately we do not have, and that is a modern minded, patriotic political leadership. Let me explain this in some detail.
India borrowed the parliamentary system of democracy from England, and incorporated it into our Constitution. Now parliamentary democracy is based on majority vote, but the truth is that the vast majority of people in India are intellectually very backward, their minds full of casteism, communalism and superstitions. So when most indians go to vote they do not see the merit of the candidate, whether he is a good man or bad, educated or not, etc, but only see the candidate's caste or religion ( or the party representing a caste or religion ). That is why there are so many people with criminal antecedents in our legislatures.

Our cunning politicians take advantage of this, and have learnt the skill of manipulating caste and religious vote banks.

The interest of the nation is to rapidly modernize, for which it is necessary to destroy feudal forces like casteism and communalism. On the other hand, the interest of our politicians is to win the next elections, and for that they have to appeal to, and therefore perpetuate, casteism and communalism, which are feudal forces. Therefore the interest of our country, and the interest of our politicians are diametrically opposite to each other. How, then, can our country progress ?
Most of the Indian politicians are rogues, rascals, gundas, criminals, scoundrels, looters and gangsters. They have no genuine love for the country, but only seek power and pelf. They are shameless and incorrigible, and cannot be reformed. They are experts in manipulating caste and communal vote banks, and they polarize society by spreading caste and communal hatred. Don't such people deserve to be shot, like mad dogs, or like the aristocrats in the French Revolution who were guillotined?
It is thus obvious that parliamentary democracy is not suited to India. Our Constitution has exhausted itself, our 'democracy' has been hijacked by feudal minded people, and all our state institutions have become hollow and empty shells.

On the other hand, the socio-economic distress of our people keeps mounting.

I submit that the solutions to the massive problems of India lie outside the system, not within it. No amount of reforms will do, what is now required is a revolution. What form this revolution will take, and how much time, cannot be predicted, but what certainly can be predicted is that it is coming.
It is only after such a revolution, which will be led by some genuinely patriotic, modern minded persons, that a just social order will be created in India, in which our masses get decent lives, and a high standard of living.""

**27 Banks today = 6 Banks Tomorrow**

Strength in unity is the chant on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s mind as a new expert committee was set up to explore possible [bank mergers](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-govt-may-form-6-stong-banks-from-merger-of-27-psbs-to-tackle-rising-bad-loan-issue-2186336) to bring down the number of state-run banks in India from 27 today to just 6 in the future. And with the bad loans crisis looming over the banking industry, strength is just what the doctor prescribed. Apparently, since public sector banks are already short-staffed, bank employees don’t have to worry about downsizing in case any of these mergers actually happen. Words of caution, however: Too big to fail?

**IIP: Third Time’s (not) the Charm**

For the third month in a row, [industrial production](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/G1Hs0uma1LuBdMLkYpQlFL/Indias-IIP-contracts-15-in-January-third-month-in-a-row.html) in India went down. The numbers for the month of January released just recently by the Central Statistical Organization don’t look good - a 1.5% drop in industrial production, that’s against a 1.2% drop in December and a 3.2% drop in November. That is bad with a capital B. Silver lining on the cloud that’s raining on everyone’s parade? Mining and Electricity sectors grew by 1.2% and 6.6% in January respectively. Raghuram Rajan, the main god that economists around the country worship who also moonlights as the Governor of RBI, has called the numbers “disappointing” while stating that though the economy is in recovery, the process is volatile.

**Housing For All by 2022**

So you thought Swachh Bharat was Prime Minister Modi’s only pet project? Then you haven’t heard about the Housing For All initiative under which the PM aims to provide homes for all Indian families by 2022. The country inched a step closer to that goal when the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament, passed a landmark bill seeking to regulate the [Real Estate](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-realestate-regulations-parliament-idINKCN0WC1DJ) sector to bring more transparency and protect consumer interests. And this bill.. get this, was passed by bipartisan support as even the Congress came out of the woodwork to extend its support. Now when was the last time you heard about the ruling and the opposition party coming together and working to pass important legislation? Almost makes you wonder if they are.. [up to something](https://j.gifs.com/v29nEn.gif).

**Not Happening: EPF Tax**

The government has suddenly become very sensitive to any kind of backlash as was apparent when Arun Jaitley announced that a key budget proposal to tax withdrawals from EPF exceeding 40% of total investment would be rolled back. The proposal led to controversy among the small but vocal professional class who viewed it as a tax on the hard-working middle-class employees, and thus was promptly [shot down](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-pensions-epf-tax-withdraw-jaitley-idINKCN0WB0BE). Might it have anything to do with the not one, not two, not three, but five states holding elections in April and May? With politics, you can be sure that the elections have a big role in.. really everything that politicians do or don’t do. 

**Vijay Mallya Just Can’t Win**

It’s hard to empathize with the problems of rich billionaires, but poor Mallya just can’t seem to catch a break. A debt recovery tribunal in Bengaluru has [cash blocked](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-barred-from-accessing-rs-515-crore-severance-pay-1284719) Vijay Mallya by halting the $75 million (₹515 crore) payment he was set to receive as settlement from Diageo plc., the largest shareholder in Mallya’s United Spirits Ltd. ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=yRjmVsGsBsWd2Aas8ovwBg)). Later, a bunch of banks ganged up on him as they seized [trademarks](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-mallya-idUSKCN0WC184) related to the now defunct Kingfisher Airlines, trademarks such as “Kingfisher”, “Flying Models” and “King of Good Times”. And then came the accusations that Mallya has fled the country, which led to the banks asking a court to return and impound his passport. Moral of the story: Kids, never borrow $1.4 billion to run a flashy airliner when you can’t repay it. Especially when you already own a successful liquor company.

**Ambani vs. Netflix**

Mukesh Ambani has decided that there is no way Netflix can just waltz into India and lay claim to his homeground without facing any competition. Not one to keep his hands off any pie, he is reportedly entering the country’s cable TV sector through his latest venture called RJio. Ambani’s Reliance Industries ([RELIANCE](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ARELIANCE&ei=DBnmVsG4Atf3jAHklKf4DA)) which already owns TV channels like CNBC, Colors, ETV and many more is planning to spend about $2 billion (₹13,403 crore) over the next three years to capture 20 million TV subscribers. One of the offerings in store from RJio is [Jio Play](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-reliance-cable-tv-idUSKCN0W92J4), a movie and TV series streaming service, in short, it’s version of Netflix. India being a massive entertainment market, Netflix probably isn’t going to watch this from the sidelines. Grab the popcorn, this movie just might get interesting.

1491427486.0,6,77,259,"NO PROGRESS ON THE PANAMA PAPERS. OVER 1800 INDIAN NAMES HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED.

""The Panama Papers illuminate a key aspect of why the system isn’t working–because globalization has allowed the capital and assets of the 1 % (be they individuals or corporations) to travel freely, while those of the 99 % cannot.

Globalization is supposed to be about the free movement of people, goods, and capital. But in fact, the system is set up to enable that mobility mainly for the rich (or for large corporations).

The result is global tax evasion, the offshoring of labor, and an elite that flies 35,000 feet over the problems of nation states and the tax payers within them.""


PANAMA: No questions asked!

The ways of India’s rich and famous are increasingly becoming public knowledge. The disclosure that as many as five hundred prominent Indian’s, including Incredible India’s latest brand ambassador - Amitabh Bachchan, owned offshore companies in Panama is just the latest of the unraveling. All one can say is that he is in the good company of the likes of Vladimir Putin, David Cameron and Nawaz Sharif among others.

Panama is a small sliver of a country in Central America joining North and South America. Its immediate geographical neighbors are Costa Rica in the north and Colombia in the south. It is the narrow isthmus that separates the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. A 77 kilometers long manmade canal capable of accommodating large ships joins the two oceans. The revenues from this were for long the nations biggest source of income since the canal opened in 1914.

Panama soon found that becoming a tax haven that assured investors of their privacy provided a more lucrative income. The proximity to the Americas, and the balmy Caribbean islands, and countries like Colombia with its huge cocaine production and export business, and Latin America’s many kleptomaniac tin pot dictators made Panama even more attractive. Till not long ago the Canal Zone was under the protection of US troops and that too served as an incentive for Americans seeking an offshore tax haven.

Panama is a tax haven, which means it is a country that offers foreign individuals and businesses little or no tax liability in a fairly politically and economically stable environment. Tax havens also provide little or no financial information to foreign tax authorities. This in short is the reason Panama is so important to our moneyed people who have good reason to hide their real wealth.

Why do the rich then want to hide their wealth? This is simply because officially they are not as wealthy as they really are. And if they honestly declared their true wealth they would not only be liable to pay more income tax but could also open many of them to various charges of corporate fraud and malfeasances that could earn them hefty prison terms.
To comprehend this one must understand how most of our “captains of industry” many of whom sit on the Prime Ministers Council of Trade and Industry became rich and powerful?

When an “industrialist” launches a new project, the project costs are usually hugely overstated. The suppliers of plant and machinery then pay the promoter kickbacks, which become the promoter capital. Thus, the more the number of projects an individual promotes the wealthier he or she becomes. But it is not income you can declare. So it gets hidden in a tax haven. This is how the big bucks are made and salted away.

A good part of this money is round tripped back to India via nearby tax havens like Mauritius or Singapore. Not surprisingly in 2015 the top FDI investing countries were Mauritius (27%) and Singapore (21%). Both are now the home of hundreds of corporate entities that act as a pass through for funds being held overseas for Indians or Indian entities. These countries are little more than cutouts for monies held in other more distant tax havens like Panama, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Lichtenstein. The smaller the country the more pliable the officials.

The fourteen PSU banks control almost 80% of the commercial credit advanced in India. In addition the government also owns the two big project finance institutions, IDBI and IFCI, and large institutional investors like LIC and general insurance companies like Oriental and GIC. The state ownership of these, with powers vested with the powers that be in New Delhi, political and bureaucratic, ensures that the projects are suitably “gold plated” without any rigorous scrutiny. And why scrutinize when projects seldom fold up and in a system where restructuring means lending more money to evergreen the loans?

The list of NPA’s includes almost the entire roster of top Indian companies. As of June 2016, the total amount of Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) for public and private sector banks is around Rs. 6 lakh crore. The NPA figures along with total debt for each of the 49 public and private sector banks were shared by the Ministry of Finance in response to a Parliament question. According to RBI estimates, the top 30 loan defaulters currently account for one-third of the total gross NPA’s of PSU banks. Till March 31, 2015, the country’s top five PSU banks had outstandings of Rs 4.87 lakh crore to just 44 borrowers, if borrowers were to be categorized in terms of those having outstandings of over Rs 5,000 crore. These businesses include Essar, Reliance ADAG, Jaiprakash Associates, Adani's, GVK, GMR and Lanco. Some of them like Essar have defaulted in the before. This stress problem is fairly endemic.

Of the big companies or groups only Tata’s, Reliance Industries and AV Birla can be considered free of financial stress. Most if not all the money earned by gold plating plant and machinery, under invoicing of exports and over invoicing of imports is retained abroad. Has anyone wondered why the UAE is the second largest destination of India’s merchandise exports ($33 billion in 2015) and third largest source of merchandise imports ($26.2 billion in 2015)?

The UAE is also the largest source of legal and illicitly imported gold. Last year India officially imported over 900 tons of gold worth $35 billion. The mysteriously owned corporations incorporated in tax havens like Panama mostly finance these exports. And a good part of the illicitly exported gold also.

According to Global Financial Integrity, a Washington DC based think-tank; Indians were estimated to have illicitly sent out $83 billion in 2015. Where does this money go? Countries like Switzerland that offer banking secrecy usually do not pay any interest on such deposits. So money goes to corporations in tax havens from where they are invested in businesses world over. Have you ever wondered how many of our top businessmen have managed to become so big overseas so soon?
This is where the Panama’s of the world come in. 

There was a time when Panama in India was synonymous with a cheap brand of cigarettes manufactured by the Dalmia Golden Tobacco Company. In the West, Panama was a man's wide-brimmed straw hat made from the leaves of the Toquilla tropical palm tree. That Panama too is now forgotten. Now Panama is synonymous with offshore corporations and assured secrecy. The times have changed.

#But wait... the Bill says 'Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services'. How are they allowed to do these *other* things?
___

There has been a lot of debate for years about the Aadhaar card. On March 16, Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 was passed as a money bill. During the debate, our finance minister said time and again that the Aadhaar cards will be used specifically for providing subsidies and other financial benefits. He *said* it, but if anyone had bothered to take a peek into the proposed bill, they would have understood what was going on. 

But alas, the bill was brought on a Friday, our representatives had to fly back home. It's [""Take out the Trash"" day](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4l3qup/how_pleb_mps_try_to_impose_their_will_and_fail/)! So, meh.

*For a detailed analysis of what the Aadhaar Bill contains and why it was passed a s money bill, [read this](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking)*

**Changing the bill *after* it becomes an Act**

Aye. That can be done. 

There is a whole **Clause 54** left lying around titled ""Power of Authority to make Regulations"" in the [passed Aadhaar Act, 2016](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/168717.pdf). This particular clause lets the government change multiple aspects of the bill by issuing notifications. These notifications are then supposed to be laid formally in both houses of Parliament once the next session begins.

[Clause 54: Regulations rock peepal!](http://imgur.com/A5DXwmx)

[MOAR REGULATIONS!](http://imgur.com/q5hLCrm)


Look at these particular subsections. The government can change provisions for any of these *without the prior approval of Parliament*:

- [Biometric Information](http://imgur.com/i4lD5oS)

- [Other purposes](http://imgur.com/wqW7aPQ)

- [Other tech safeguards](http://imgur.com/xrJZpCO)

- [Maintaining, updating and deletion of Aadhaar numbers](http://imgur.com/3xhjdhm)

All of these subsections are so bloody vague that they can cover anything that a citizen does. What the heck does ""other purposes"" even mean?!

I have never seen anyone in Parliament challenging a notification. Many Acts are slyly changed in this manner. Please note (before you start outraging about how evil the present government is), this phenomenon is not something that was started by the Modi government, all governments in the past have been doing it in one way or the other. By keeping the wordings vague in the proposed bill itself, it gives a leeway for the executive to change it at a later date without consulting Parliament.

But... this has to stop somewhere, right? RIGHT?

___
#What can we do about it now?
___
Well, nothing, I’m afraid. I just wanted to put it out there. The only public intervention possible was *before* the Bill became an Act.  

Unless the [Supreme Court strikes down the Aadhaar Act’s validity](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4g34n7/an_important_supreme_court_hearing_is_coming_up/) or says it’s an invasion of the fundamental right to privacy, the public can’t do anything about it except watch & get Aadhaar cards in the process. 

If the SC *does* strike the Act down, I’m afraid it might be too late. The government is already on an overdrive to get maximum Aadhaar registrations. They are claiming that more than a billion people are now registered, even Aanganwaadis and Government hospitals are doing daily drives to get newborns registered.


I will end with a quote by a wise fictional one eyed man called Alastor “Mad Eye” Moody:

1542939833.0,6,4,9,"Hello everyone, let's discuss about our states. We all know that some of our states are too populated to govern efficiently. However, creation of so many smaller states is very difficult. So, we need Autonomous Regions (AR).

For example, UP has close to 200 million people. There are only four countries on earth with more population than UP ! Even Maharashtra and Bihar had 100 million plus people in 2011. West Bengal had more than 91 million in 2011 too. There are only 13 countries on earth with 100 million club. The US state with highest population is California (39 mil), we have 11 states with more than that.

So, it seems that for better serving the populace we need states with lesser population. State governments tend to keep all power in the hands of a select few leaders and thus failed to spread development evenly around the state.

However, dividing our states into smaller one would be very problematic. It would create political shit storms and turmoils so powerful that no central government would withstand that. Just see what happened during the creation of Telengana. 

So, the better solution would be dividing states into semi-autonomous regions. There are 14 such regions already exist in India like Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Kargil, Ladakh etc.

Bigger states should be divided into a few autonomous regions (AR). It would have its own local governments with limited powers.

The AR's could be like that:

1) Population below 10 millions except the Metropolis AR's like Mumbai, Kolkata etc.

2) The local government of the AR should be formed via Panchayet and Municipal elections by their elected members. Another extra election should be avoided.

3) These AR's should have powers and funds for village and town developments, local road constructions, sanitations, health cares, school education, waterbody and forest conservation, tourism development, industrial developments, land and land reforms etc.

4) The state government will control the police, judiciary, state civil services, higher educational institutions, state highways etc.

5) The state government and the central agencies will collect the taxes. The ARs would collect some local taxes like tolls, small business license fees etc. The tax revenues would be distributed among the AR's, state governments and the central government by the rules of the finance commissions.

6) The AR's would have limited legislative powers which would enables them to pass some laws. However, they would be under the legislative authority of the state.

7) So, there could be more than hundreds of such AR. Every metro city city should form its own AR.

Let's debate.

1509618876.0,6,25,37,"So I read a post about a teen about his options if he went ahead to skip college and I wanted to know what options I got.

I am 23, undergrad in BBA in Finance and working in a family business for almost a year. I do not know if I am meant for the business and how the future for the business holds. 

But lets say, if I were to join the work force at the age of 30, what skills can I self-teach to make myself employable in the next 7-8 years? I mostly do door-to-door sales for my business, but not sure if I enjoy that. Programming, graphic design, AI, etc. what would you suggest? I am average at maths. 

I am not planning to get a masters degree. Will that hurt me in the future?

Also, on a side note, how can I become street smart?

Now, does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? I couldn't find out. Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit.

What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. We just don't have daily interaction with the RBI, so most don't know or care. RBI policies and actions affect everything. And I mean everything!

1512477486.0,6,24,58,"Under the proposed Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017, one idea is to have a bail in clause. 

The bill has suggested that the use of the 'bail-in' provision may result in *cancellation of a liability, which could extend to bank deposits,* or could lead to modification of the terms or changing the form of the asset class.

How is this even on the table?

But my grades are pretty low and am pretty sure my CGPA will be low when my my final results come out. I have also flunked in few subjects in my 5th sem for which I am busy giving re-exams so I'm not able to focus on admissions and before I realised the last date for admission has already passed for most of the colleges across India. The only hopes I have are with MS university Baroda (where I did my B.Com Honours) where I am sure to get admission but it's not very reputable. Or Indian School of Business and Finance Delhi where the admissions are still open. But the problem with ISBF is that they are only offering PG diploma courses (1 year courses) and the fees are expensive af (2.5k admission fee and 5.1 lakh annual fee for just one year). Also there is a lot of competition for admission and I have to give an entrance test and personal interview. My options seem to be shrinking by the minute and I don't know what to do. My parents are dead against me taking a year's gap and bugging me night and day for flunking in my 5th sem exam. What I need is genuine advice and a little support, something am not getting at all.

1523387545.0,6,6,4,"In light of the ring fencing of banks by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its first monetary policy review of 2018-19, entities regulated by RBI shall, with immediate effect, not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs. Banks & other financial institutions which are already providing such services have been given a window of **3 months** to terminate these services.

Even though the exchanges & crypto community in India are seeking remedial action against RBI's diktat, I am not very hopeful that we'll be able to get a stay order from the Supreme Court of India in favour of crypto-currencies. The primary reason for my skepticism being the *little to no understanding of the crypto world that Indian government possesses.* It's noteworthy and depressing at the same time that Finance Minister of India [compared cryptocurrencies to ponzi schemes late last year.](https://qz.com/1171183/bitcoin-is-neither-legal-nor-illegal-in-india-and-everyones-confused/)

Not many users out here know that [Indian crypto markets crashed flat 25-30%](http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/with-rbi-s-near-ban-announcement-cryptocurrency-prices-crash-sharply-118040501410_1.html) in less than an hour of RBI notification on **April 5, 2018** because of panic selling by investors whereas the foreign exchanges didn't show any substantial fluctuations because of the same.

This decline in value is sure to repeat at the end of the 3 months window (keeping in mind the **assumption** that RBI's decision holds at the end of these 3 months) with a greater percentage fall this time because investors will not be able to convert their fiat to crypto anymore in India for the immediate future. Personally, I won't be much surprised if XRP value comes down to 0.05$-0.10$ at that time. Without any exception, same shall be the fate of other VCs too.

So, the opportunity lies for those who have accounts with foreign banks since they shall be able to procure cryptocurrencies at dirt cheap prices here in India and be able to sell them abroad at the normal prices prevailing in world markets. This shall be beneficial for both categories of people, those looking to profit out of arbitrage and those intending to HODL them. I admit this post benefits only some investors based on their geographical presence and not the cryptoverse at large but one should make the most of what she/he has. *When life throws rocks at you, build a fort out of them.* ;)

I'm so sad about the tragedies going on at our borders right now. To me, an Indian life lost is as big a travesty as a Pakistani life lost, and I know my Pakistani friends feel the same.
