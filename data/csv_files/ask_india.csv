1548577106,india,blackout24,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/akaal5/question_regarding_customs_when_arriving_in_india/,4,0,,,Question regarding customs when arriving in India,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be flying into Bangalore in a few weeks. I'm trying to get a clear understanding of what I'm allowed to bring into the country. For this I looked at the information provided by Bangalore Airport on the ""International Arrivals"" and ""Customs"" page.

&amp;#x200B;

[http://www.bengaluruairport.com/airportInformation/airportInformation.jspx](http://www.bengaluruairport.com/airportInformation/airportInformation.jspx) 

&amp;#x200B;

From the ""International Arrivals"" page it looks like I'm allowed to bring one laptop (for work I usually also have a Macbook but I'll just leave it at home) and ""Electronic goods valued at less than Rs.25,000"". I have an iPhone provided by my company and a personal Android phone, both worth way more than Rs.25,000. Will I have to pay customs on them? In that case I should probably only take the iPhone with me. It also states that I'm allowed to bring up to Rs.25,000 in cash as forign visitor. On a different website I read that I'm not allowed to take Rupees out of the country. So what if I don't spend it all? On the ""Customs"" page it also says that I only have an allowance of Rs.15,000 as foreign visitor. What does ""NIL"" mean on the same page in the Foreign Tourist allowance table?

&amp;#x200B;

This will be my first time traveling to India so I'm a bit clueless and don't want to run into any surprises. Help would be very much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

While working on the project, we regularly interact with our foreign clients through Skype/Webex/e-mail. However, we have never got opportunity to go abroad and work with them directly.

I've got my first job and its the contract ending with the ending of this month. I'd gone through a real emotional turmoil during those 70+ odd interviews.

Though I've made myself content by started to read game of thrones books and most of the time quora and reddit.

My hobbies are acting dramatics and i do like to write stories.

About you, you should be self motivated about your career and relations. I would not want someone who just like those fake or small talks and then vanish away.

If it turns out good I'd definitely marry. I'm not someone who is just lurking around for sexual favours or something. I appreciate the thoughts and the importance it has while falling for love.

so looking forward keep talking in chats and then if you want I can move near you as well. I already have interviews for job opportunities in Germany, sweeden, Netherlands, Singapore and mighty USA. ( Since EU countries allows developers to get there) 

So I want to see how much our frequency matches.

My soul purpose of putting this post here to get some feedback on myself. Since I do hangout with people from office have some drinks with them but then I mostly found is they ignore me for even Lunch or tea break times. 

I have started understanding the whole Football world by following those Premier League, UEFA, LaLiga, that is going on right now thank to reddit. And putting all that effort just so that I can converse and make more friends with people who are deeply involved in Football world. But still its the same people just ignore or forget about me.

The thing which annoys me the most is I can't keep doing small talk for everyday for 2-3 months I want someone reliable to be my friend and keep talking to me, like I have this concept of being best friend you do remember the past talks otherwise its like talking to a vending machine. 

The thing that saddens me the most is I see a lot of nay-sayers, shallow, less-knowledgable persons getting awesome jobs and girls but when I see myself that I'm doing all those work and not achieving I feel so much sad and I just look down on myself so much. I'm not some creep or introvert who can't make conversations I do try it and hold the conversation but why god why? Like if you want to talk about cosmetics I would like to talk about what Revelon is doing with their products etc.

So all my fellow Indians here please guide me as I'm feeling so out of life and my path in terms of career and personal life as well. Mom at back home is looking for girls to directly marry me, I'm not saying I don't want to marry but then they control that I can't talk to a girl who is like 4-5 years elder to me so I have a lot of BS to tackle.

I'm yet to understand all those financial taxation and how will I invest to have a good savings in coming years I also need to help my dad with that house loan but not much burden is there.

Will life be like this all the time in India where you are just moving on roads with crowd hustling for going to job and come back to cook on my own ( that too sometimes backfire and make a messy cooker :D) I got really afraid after I have seen recent interview of Anurag Kashyap saying that in India we are just barely able to survive. I don't want to digest that but I know that's the truth. And even this tech giant metro city I feel all alone every day after coming back from office and after cooking.

If you think you're going to pay only ₹49 since you only watch Star, you're wrong. You are going to have to buy a mandatory package of FTA channel subscription where the price you're paying for is network capacity and anything above is your choice and all the prices are GST exclusive so, for people who watch all kinds of programmes are the one to be affected since they'll be shelling out more than before, and for an average family who have a fixed TV show routine, it'll be a cost reduction for them.

1. Individuals must have a minimum educational qualification (for example at least Xth pass)
2. Be no more than a particular age (say 60 years)

Current voting restrictions are:

Individuals who are convicted of offences committed under Section 171E (which deals with bribery) and Section 171F (which deals with personation or undue influence at an election) of the Indian Penal Code are disqualified from participating in elections.

Those convicted of offences under Section 125 (which deals with various electoral offences), Section 135 and Section 136 of the Representation of People’s Act face disqualification from elections.

If an individual votes in more than one constituency, his vote is disqualified.

•Individuals are below the age of 18.

Caveats: 
This is obviously a thought experiment. I firmly believe in the fundamental rights and freedoms lent by democracy. 

Rationale:
1. My original proposed restriction was IQ, but that is a surprisingly subjective measurement. Besides, conducting ""Bhatia's modified IQ test"" or something similar on a massive population like ours seems a bit difficult. We currently have systems in place like schools to deliver education. Besides, this particular restriction may make our politicians take education a bit more seriously. 

2.  I respect the elderly and their contribution to our society. But old ideologies irrelevant in modern times. Besides, by that age they retire and their social/economic dynamics are similar to that of underage individuals.

Now I wish to apply to Canada for student visa but one consultant told me that since I had a gap year it'll maybe mess with my application and cause a rejection. 

I already have a gap year and I most certainly do not want to get another one. 

Do you think I should take a chance and apply anyway? Or check another country which is more likely to give me visa (UK since my degree is from there)

This is coming across as a no-true-Scotsman phenomenon - where you don't have the right to speak if you are also not a ""true Scotsman"" - or an Indian citizen with an Indian passport.

I think his current citizenship should not be a factor in judging his actions and positions. I think it is even more admirable that Akshay Kumar, despite changing his citizenship to a foreign country continues to make efforts to contribute to the country.

And I think we should all do this - work on emigrating and if you can try to do it  - make a good life for yourself and then try to serve the country of your birth even if you don't necessarily are fond of everything in your country of birth.

People of Jewish descent are all over the world. They continue to impact public opinion and foreign policy as citizens of other countries in favour of Israel. We should be like them.

I understand the grey area that this comes with - that your allegiance is on paper with some other country. I rationalize it with the hope that - I hope no day comes when my adopted country and my country of birth will ever be in conflict and I will have to choose a side.

-----   
Breakfast:  grilled vegetables such as capsicum, brocolli and pumking and a fish fillet.   
  
Lunch: dal rice  
    
Evening: ginger milk tea   
    
Dinner: roti with cauliflower, or some peas, potato subzi    
----   
I've modified my diet in order to lose weight. I'm trying to reduce my portions. No more tea.     
---   
So my new diet that started last week looks like:    
  
Breakfast:  Boiled egg, grilled vegetables/sometimes Upma  
  
Lunch: plain dal to drink with plain bean sprouts/grilled chicken      
    
Evening: nothing, no tea    
  
Dinner: plain dal to drink/ grilled chicken  
----     
In addition to my diet, I also go to the gym 3-4 days a week. I do cardio on one day, train the legs on the other, and train my upper body+ arms on another day.       
   
So, is this a good way to lose weight? I have some belly fat I want to reduce. (by around 5 kilos). I am aware we humans cannot target only our belly to reduce weight. Am I moving in the right direction? Is dal good for my diet because I read that it has high proteins.   
    
Thanks!

1547367308,india,wayforyou,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/afhe9b/as_a_european_i_have_made_some_observations_about/,84,0,,,"As a European, I have made some observations about Indians and I want to know your thoughts on it"," 

As a preface, I'm a 23-year-old Eastern European guy who has interacted with or observed several Indians online and I've noticed quite a few things about them and no, it's not the bobs vegana thing. 

* I noticed a very particular attitude in them, which is very different from their Western counterparts - it's that in general, Indian men my age tend to have a naive worldview - they usually look at the world the way a 12 year old or a middle-aged woman would. I have no intention of offending anyone, I'm just curious as to why this seems to be a thing. My interactions with Indian women are extremely limited (only one) and she seemed very Western minded so I didn't feel much of difference.    
To explain, they would, for example, in complete seriousness, state very obvious no-brainers as if they're something groundbreaking. For example, ""harassing is a crime and those who commit it are bad people"" and ""we should be nice to everyone,"" and ""we should pick up the trash,"" and etc. My only honest response can be, *well duh, no shit, captain obvious*.  
I have never come across any westerners espousing these kinds of views in such a serious manner as if they *truly believed* in them. I mean, we all believe in them but we also know that many such things are a given.  
At first, I took it as a joke, but it took me a while to figure out that the Indian guys with this mentality were actually unironic. The Indian girl I spoke with tried to explain it to me with the fact that in the West, people become independent at a young age and move out. That may be the case in many Western countries and even here in many cases but in Eastern Europe, it is very common for extended families to live together, both because of the economy and because of culture – and with all of that in mind, people my age still living with parents are  still not even remotely as naive-sounding as these Indian guys. Actually, they're no different from anyone else. So I guess that this maybe has something to do with these Indian guys being sheltered? Or perhaps it's something else because of the culture. Imo it’s almost as if these guys lacked some crucial social development phase.  

* I guess in addition to this point, they often do not get sarcasm as they take what's written very seriously though I guess this would be true for anyone not fluent in the language.  


&amp;#x200B;

* Another odd thing about Indians, in general, is the mixture of English and local dialects in your sentences. While I have learned that it is a result of necessity and history – with English being the only common language among your multitude of languages, but what is odd that Hindi doesn't just mix individual words but entire parts of sentences. I do not see this phenomenon anywhere else in the world.   
Usually, countries where some foreign languages have a massive influence in day-to-day life, such as the Swedish language in Finland or the Russian language in my country, only use the occasional loan word is ever used in a sentence. The idea of mixing the two languages together with anything more than just one or maybe two words is just perplexing.   
Like, I’d hear half a sentence in Hindi, then not just one word but an entire part of the sentence would be spoken in English, and then maybe the rest would be in Hindi again. In my language, we at best just mix our local language with the occasional English ‘’ok’’ or Russian ‘’blyat’’ and etc.  
There are quite a few Indian exchange students in m city and I'd often come across them in public transport. I would hear them talk in Hindi, which I, of course, don't understand, but then I'd hear an entire string of words in English.

&amp;#x200B;

* The obsession with jewellery. Not necessarily precious jewellery though. I see Indian women in Bollywood songs wearing a lot of jewellery, so much so that I dubbed them walking kiosks because a single woman could compete in quantity with any if not all the jewellery kiosks in my hometown.   
I've heard that Indians have this stereotype about Western women and how they lack modesty and to me it sounds very hypocritical considering how a Western woman would at best have an earring, a ring and a bracelet and that's about it.

&amp;#x200B;

* My last observation is that, Indians I've come across tend to be blindingly patriotic . They get extremely defensive and critical when someone points out problems in India. They abuse the person stating facts and resort to whataboutism. Whereas overly patriotic people from other countries would just resort to telling you to go f yourself and other such insults but that's about it.

Truth:- They were NOT in the blacklist, but in greylist which has not much effect.","**Title of the article** \-  [India’s trying to get Pakistan on FATF blacklist, but it won’t really hurt their economy](https://theprint.in/diplomacy/indias-trying-to-get-pakistan-on-fatf-blacklist-but-it-wont-really-hurt-their-economy/196049/)

The article go on to say that India's effort is completely useless and will not do much. This is at a time when India is strongly pushing to put Pakistan in the FATF blacklist.

&amp;#x200B;

**Read this paragraph -** 

 

&gt;Given the costs, getting Pakistan on the FATF blacklist might seem an effective way to punish the country for the Pulwama attacks. But [evidence](https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/how-will-being-on-the-fatf-grey-list-actually-impact-pakistan/) suggests otherwise.  
&gt;  
&gt;This won’t be the first time Pakistan is blacklisted by the watchdog. **Pakistan was on this blacklist from 2012 to 2015** and the actual effects of the move on its economy were negligible.  
&gt;  
&gt;During this period, Pakistan managed to successfully complete an IMF programme of $5 billion and the country’s exports remained relatively stable.

&amp;#x200B;

That is a FAKE information. Pakistan was never put on blacklist as far as I can see. They were on GREYLIST inbetween 2012 to 2015 AND the problem is that the link which they have given for the word **""evidence"" in the above paragraph itself says that pakistan was on the greylist.**

Their own link says it was greylist, yet they purposefully are spreading fake information even after knowing the truth. Just to make sure you understand this, I will copy the paragraph from their ""evidence"" link -

 

&gt;The factual evidence, both historic and current, suggests that these assertions are simply incorrect. **Pakistan was on the FATF grey-list from 2012 to 2015**, a period during which it successfully completed an IMF program and raised over $5 billion from the international bond markets. During this period Pakistan’s imports and exports remained stable, evidence that the grey-listing did not raise any significant barriers to trade.

Putting Pakistan on Blacklist is like sanctioning Pakistan. Currently only North Korea and Iran are in Blacklist. This would have tremendous effect on their economy.

So, why are they spreading fake information purposefully? There should be an outrage against the writer of that article, and they should be held responsible.

Overnight, I thought about my current life and about all of the feelings that I have regarding depression, unacceptance, rejection, dislike and isolation - all feelings of which I feel almost on a constant basis, and so I read and saw on Youtube once or several times (and now believe wholeheartedly) about how before we're all born, via reincarnation, we sign soul contracts with these alien-demonic beings called Archons or the Demiurge, these are soul contracts that are agreements that we are tricked into making (by the Archons/Demiurge) before reincarnating back to Earth, regarding the karma that we have to repay for some negative deeds we have done in our past life (negative deeds that don't even belong to us in the first place).

We repay the karma through a lifetime of hardships that we will have to endure when we reincarnate. They call the hardships ""lessons"". Once we agree to the lessons that are filled with hardships, then we reincarnate back here to live life - again and go through the lifelong hardships, and the hardships keeps us at a low vibrational frequency, which causes negative emotions and feelings such as anger, *sadness, depression, rejection, unacceptance, isolation* and more.

Energy outbursts from negative emotions and feelings are how the Archons get fed,  which is why they trick us into these soul contracts that are filled with hardships, once we do go through the white light after death and agree to reincarnate once again.

Every time you reincarnate here, you become enslaved to this existence once again, and again, and again, and again....

I wasn't meant to be here, and other humans weren't meant to be here either, but what has happened is that, a lot of these other humans have adapted to the ways of this lower vibrational plane, in regards to them being mean, spiteful, isolating and ignoring people and unaccepting of people...And so I guess that's why they call this plane of existence, the lowest form - hell, because it is....",,aofz4n,,0,,false,1553037467,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/aofz4n/archon_soul_trap_how_many_of_you_believe_it_is/,,,false,AskIndia,

Since, Jio didn't listen to [my earlier post](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/as79fy/open_letter_to_reliance_jio_from_an_indian/), I'm trying again now by reposting it.

------
Dear Jio,

Really appreciate your innovative 4G LTE product and I want you to know that I was one of the first to try it when you launched back in 2016.

But recently, I shifted to Hulimavu area in Bangalore and my average internet speed dwindled from 5 mbps to 0.5 mbps :(. The problem seems to be with the tower here which doesn't seem to handle the load. The speed is acceptable (~1 mbps) in the early mornings and afternoons when there is less activity, but it crawls down to less than 0.2 mbps in the evenings and late nights.

The dBm value is about -115 which could be an indication of poor signal strength too but you will know better. The place is Dodda Kammanahalli road at the south of Hulimavu lake ([this area](https://i.imgur.com/7C5nDKe.png) to be precise).

I know that the voice of a common Indian doesn't carry much weight in a country of 1.6 billion, but I'm still doing it because that's the least I could do. And besides, since the very mission of Jio was to make data accessible and affordable to the masses, I'm hopeful that my query will be listened to. I request you to solve the connectivity issue in my area by installing a new tower or repeater or whatever.

Regards,

An humble Indian citizen.",,b0jqyb,,0,,false,1560187668,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b0jqyb/repost_open_letter_to_reliance_jio_from_an_indian/,,,false,AskIndia,

We need Philosopher Kings in power. For me, a philosopher king is a person who gets 100 crores with freedom to spend it on anything and still that person spends atleast 95 crores of it to make this world or country a better place and knows where to spend.

Just like Judiciary (High Court and Supreme court ) what we need in Executive and Legislative organs are people who have sacrificed their pleasures in life, seeked truth and justice in harsh conditions 

I think PIL Lawyers have all these qualities. Even though 100 crore  rupee experiment is not done on them,these lawyers after serving for 20 years, become judges in upper courts, which results in a Supreme Court that is atleast 80% honest.

So why not give the positions of IAS, MLA and MP to only these PIL lawyers?.

Remember, logic and our coolective needs is important than emotions and conventional rules.

Okay I am a pretty much average student but with consistency and hard work,  I could be better and lately I am trying to do so and other than course work I haven't discovered or ventured other aspects of my field. I am interested in Video Game Developments but knowing the struggle I want to pursue something else that is practical and could pay me in the future. I am interested in Deep Learning but  I am afraid to give my all to it as I also want to follow my passion.

  
I know that I have wasted a lot of time that's why with what's remaining with me I want to give my all into one of the above either Video Game Development or Deep Learning.

The reason I am asking is because since I belong to a College who's brand power is not that much stronger as other colleges, so the Teachers focus on GPAs, so that we can at least get a good job when we Graduate but I know I can be better if I invest my time in honing my skills in other places, something that is more valuable than my degree.

I (42M) have been married for 18+ years and have a great relationship with my wife(40F) and kids. However there is one side of me which my family is not aware of.  For past 20 years or so, I had an (almost) gf (also 40F).  My ex gf and I used to text/talk on phone during my commute+work hours. We would talk about each and everything under earth and beyond.  Occasionally we would meet and few times we even hooked up as well.  Both of our spouses were completely unaware of this-as the relationship was strictly 9-6.  Her family relocated to another  city 5 years ago, and long distance started impacting our relationship and we started drifting apart. We had multiple rounds of breakup and patch up but eventually things just faded away and now for past 15 months we dont talk/text each other at all.

&amp;#x200B;

None of my friends/family were aware of whatever was going on.  I was, and am, a completely family man post work. This breakup has caused severe impact to me emotionally. There is a big emotional void in my life now.  I would like to fill that void and make some new female friends-however this almost seems impossible.  I do not go to clubs, do not drink/smoke. Rarely spend my evening/weekends without family.  Women of my age bracket are either not available or mostly looking for commitment prone relationship, which obviously is not my preference.

When I come across the accounts of Indian forces' excesses, it seems similar to what other insurgencies and their host sympathetic populations faced. Matter of fact it seems like India has more kiddy gloves in Kashmir valley than with all these non Islamist insurgencies.

I also see a lot of Indians sympathetic towards the Kashmiri Muslims' plight, but did they have the same empathy for the other groups?

It seems like there are two big political party this time: NDA, which has Modi, his friends and their friends from other parties. And the other one is UPA, whose leader is Rahul (Sonia? Priyanka?) Gandhi, and their friends from Congress and other party. There are some party that doesn't like to be friends with either of them. But I'd like to vote the guy who got ticket from either UPA or NDA (or their friend) in my constituency. So my questions are,

- Which party is leaning towards communism/socialism and which party is leaning towards capitalism/free market?

- Which party is more nationalistic and which is more glo alistic?

- Which party is more secular?

- Which party is more likely to be authoritarian and which one is liberitarian?

- Which party is liberal and which is more conservative?

- Which party is more likely support open border and which is more likely to keep refugees away?

- Which party is more likely to go for military action vs which one is more likely go for diplomatic solutions?

- Which party is more likely to decrease taxes and which one will increase taxes?

- Which party is more likely to go against reservation and which one is more likely to increase quota?

- Which party is more likely to support women's rights vs which party is more likely to support equal rights?

- If it ever happens which party is more likely to stand for strong gun laws vs which is more likely to support the right to bear arms?

- Which party is more likely to bring police sensitization?

- Which party is more likely to support legalization of drugs?

These are some question that are on the top of my head. I am not asking you to tell me who to vote. And I am not yet decided who to vote. I don't want you to sway my opinion towards any particular party. I want to make the decision myself.

Also, any other question I didn't come up myself or anything I should know before I vote, please let me know. Thank you, everybody for your time.

Hi all, this is going to be a little lengthy, and I'm trying clear up some misconceptions that I realized I may have about India. So, I'm Indian, born in India but lived in the US for most of my life. As such many of my friends have asked for my thoughts on traveling to India. I've only really been to Pune(my family's hometown), Delhi once, Bombay a few times but never explored much of it, so I'm probably not actually the best person to give out travel advice for India. My friends(who have traveled in Asia but not India) and I got into a pretty heated argument last night when talking about another friend of ours who wants to visit India(lets call her Nancy). Just a back ground on Nancy, she's white and in her 20s, never been anywhere but Europe for travel, outside of a few resorts in Mexico. She likes a lot of fancy things, and likes to indulge in nice foods, visiting art museums, wineries, etc. Also, she had a bad experience with Indian food once(in the US), and pretty much avoids it like the plague.

Typing this out sounds pretty bad, but my gut reaction when hearing she wanted to go was that she probably shouldn't. I can't see her enjoying her time there, I felt like Nancy would be in for the shock of her life the minute she stepped outside the airport and sees the pollution, large crowds, people shitting on the side of the road, constant honking traffic, the smells are different, etc. This is not even accounting for the fact she doesn't like to try exotic foods, and gets very uncomfortable around Indian food. My friends argument was that she could probably stay at a resort in somewhere like Goa, eat western food all day and check India off as a travel destination. To which my response was why even go to India at that point, if you're not going to eat any of the food, not leave a resort, not make trips to visit other tourist attractions? Might as well go to Hawaii or Florida or somewhere.

My friends thought I was calling Nancy soft, that I was hyping India up to be this ridiculously hard place to travel to if you're a novice traveler. That wasn't my intention at all, I just thought the hypothetical experience of Nancy going to India wouldn't be enjoyable for her, and I might have used some hyperbolic statements to describe India. But then I'm realizing maybe I was underestimating her and shouldn't, maybe people want to spend their vacations going to resorts, and the more western friendly parts of India like Rajasthan. Also maybe I'm making too any assumptions about India without actually having traveled the country much, and it changes a lot each time I go back. So I guess my question is if you had a friend with a similar background who wanted to go to India, would you recommend it ? What places in India would be the most western tourist friendly ?",,aczj68,,0,,false,1552594168,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/aczj68/recommending_india_as_a_travel_destination/,,,false,AskIndia,

Numbers have been out for the year 2016 and in states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra and Karnataka, whose sex ratios were much higher than national average, are now declining. The highest drop is found in AP, where the ratio stands is at 806 (girls per 1000 boys) which was 971 in 2015. Karnataka and TN have seen a fall too.  Although this applies to north India as well, the situation seems to be worse in the south.

This is a [great chart](https://i.imgur.com/pfDB2dx.jpg) that compares the ratios over the years. Do you think the numbers might be skewed because of low rates of birth registration? Or is female foetecide on the rise again? Would like to know your thoughts on this.

long time lurker, I know this is long but please bear with me 

I recently got a job after graduating last year and today my colleagues where talking about savings so that they can save on taxes and I did not understand what they were discussing at all, when I mentioned the same to them they explained to me that you can claim a certain amount of your income as  savings by investing or something(didn't exactly understand the investment this part as I mentioned I am a dummy when it comes to financing) which can then push you into lower income slab. this is a very good tip and thought things like these would be very helpful to new employees like me who are new to this whole ITR filing. so, These are my questions

what other ways can one claim on income (legally of course) so that it can become non-taxable?

I know of HRA or Home rent allowance where you can claim your rent as non-taxable something like this would be great

how can I show  my income as savings like where to invest or any other ways(an eli5 would be greatly appreciated)

I researched on my part about filling ITR a little and have a basic understanding but if someone can do a idiots guide to filling ITR that would be good for future reference.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am asking a lot but I thought this can be a very useful guide to the community for personal finance and taxes as our schools and colleges don't even mention the word the tax but now we have a whole law(IT law) we can break without our knowledge and pay dearly for it.

&amp;#x200B;

if it helps anyone this is my salary split, my package is 8LPA I take home 6LPA (around  50k for a month after taxes)  I will gladly provide any non-identifying information required.

1549448862,india,Xargxes,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/anpf4u/for_native_gujarati_speakers_what_does_murmur/,9,1,,,For native Gujarati speakers: What does ''murmur'' sound like? I would love some slow recordings of this ''murmur''/''breathy voice. [repost],"Dear speakers of Gujarati,

I would love to listen to and learn more about the phenomenon of ""murmur""/""breathy voice"" in Gujarati and to be able to pronounce it myself in order to learn the difference between a normal \[h\] and this Gujarati way of merging the \[h\] with a vowel. Gujarati is a special language, because murmur is said to occur in it more than in any other language.

Wikipedia says you use murmur in Gujarati in three special cases. (The murmur is phonetically represented by two dots under the vowel in question): 

1. At the beginning of words, where an 'h' is formally written but not pronounced as such. For example: the written હવે \[ɦəʋe\] ""now"" you pronounce as \[ə̤ʋe\]; \[ɦɑɽkũ\] ""bone"" as \[ɑ̤ɽkũ\].
2. When in a written word a vowel is preceded by an 'h' and an unstressed vowel (schwa). For example: The written સહેલું \[səɦelũ\] ""easy"" you pronounce as સેલું \[sɛ̤lũ\]; બહું \[bəɦoɭũ\] ""large"" as \[bɔ̤ɭũ\]; દહાડો \[d̪əɦɑɽo\] ""day"" as દાડો \[d̪a̤ɽo\].
3. When a vowel is preceded by and' h' and an 'a'/schwa, which you pronounce with a glide (right...?). For example: written \[ɾəɦi\] ""stayed"" is pronounced as \[ɾə̤j\]; \[bəɦu\] ""very"" as \[bə̤ʋ\].

Also in irregular Gujarati verbs like કહેવું ""to say"", it says on the internet that murmur occurs a lot.

I would love to hear some spoken examples of this so called ""murmur"", but I could not find any audio pronunciations of these individual words on e.g. Google Translate. Moreover I only study Sanskrit, but do not speak any living Indian languages, so when I listen to e.g. the news in Gujarati, the phenomenon happens too quickly for me to notice it.

For more details: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarati\_phonology#Murmur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarati_phonology#Murmur)

Which is why I turned to you with some questions:

1. Do you have any recordings to recommend in which the phenomenon happens? Preferably the words should be pronounced clearly and slowly, if possible even in the 'formal' written way and in the 'informal' normal way as you'd say it on the streets, so those who do not speak can clearly distinguish between the two.
2. If you do not know of any such recordings, would you make one yourself? :)
3. Does this murmur occur in any other Indian languages you know of, like Marathi or Hindi?

Looking forward to hearing from you.",,anpf4u,,0,,false,1553024384,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/anpf4u/for_native_gujarati_speakers_what_does_murmur/,,,false,AskIndia,

I mean before Internet, I used to get irritated by company ads only after I switched on TV. But now every random entrepreneur hires a digital marketing company and they irritate me by sending messages and emails and by calling.

They specialize in SEO. So better the SEO tactics, more the chances of a business showing on top of a google search. The customer buys stuff from the first link of google search. He is happy with the product. This customer does not even realize that the 8th or 9th link product that spent most of its money on quality of the product rather than advertising it was better in quality than the 1st link. So now every customer will buy the 1st link product, thanks to SEO games.  So basically the system is saying to entrepreneurs ""No problem if you spend more on advertising and less on R&amp;D, this is how this world works. You just need to compromise with your honesty""

Also, its like the more a company messages, manipulates google search and spam calls the customers, the more the chances of their business getting sales. So an entrepreneur who is against irritating people will lose the race. What is the limit to such form of aggressive marketing? Tommorrow these digital marketing companies will start a child labour campaign in which they will give pamphelets to little kids from slums who will roam all around the city asking every random person to buy this or that stuff. Who will stop them?

I mean in an ideal world, there would be a ""National Advertisement Portal"" 

Have you opened a business of optical store and you want everyone to know about it? How about you go to this app called National Advertisement Portal, add your business, people upvote you for your good service and in a few months, just like Reddit, your business reaches top?

So basically, NAP would be democratic like Reddit. Whereas Digital Marketing is chaotic like Facebook and Twitter.

Which type of chaos are we all heading towards, Redditors?
Is Digital Marketing really justified?",,axi2os,,0,,false,1560133959,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/axi2os/redditors_of_india_what_do_you_think_of_morality/,,,false,AskIndia,

I have been travelling with friends and am based in Delhi, we have been to Kerala, Chandigarh (Mohali for the cricket) and Mumbai but my friends have gone home and I have nothing planned for the next week. I’m not much of a solo traveller but I’d like to visit one place before my flight, I just don’t know where. Ideally it would be somewhere not difficult to get to from Delhi (cheap flight or driving) and a place where I can chill out on my own or get to know some people as I’ll be on my own. My only requirements are nothing too cold as I don’t have the clothes for it and will be making a trip to the north next year to see it properly and also nothing which I will feel overwhelmed with the amount of things to do - I like to go somewhere and see/do what I can do I don’t want something which will make me feel like I didn’t have enough time. 

My family have all recommended Rishikesh. I’ve heard about the hippie culture there which isn’t something I’m about but I would be interested in a place I can smoke weed and do shrooms so I guess that it would be a good place for that haha but I don’t know much about it really.

So, here goes...

I'm currently in process of obtaining an Indian visa. Am an Irish, UK-based editor (not in current affairs) and, though I'm purely coming for recreational purposes, I have to apply as a journalist. This seems pretty unfair (it's more than £200, almost four times as expensive as a normal tourist visa), but I've sucked it up when I've visited your beautiful country previously and the fact I already have Indian journalist visas stamped in my passport makes trying to circumnavigate the requirement seem too risky to bother. 

However, as I fill in this application, I begin to question whether I should delay submitting it until things have settled down a little up in Kashmir (one hopes!). I'm not travelling until May and I wonder whether the powers that be will be inclined to sign off on any journalist visas right now. It would be really interesting to get your thoughts. Am I overthinking things and being paranoid? Also, what do you think accounts for us poor journalists (not the most glorified profession in the current global political environment, I'll grant you) being so marked out for special treatment, even if we're only coming over to lie on a beach or walk up a mountain?

I think, I lack skills required by the companies like DS/Algo etc. I should've realised that earlier instead of relying on my luck. The thing is I'm already 23 and age is fleeting like fast wind. As I get older, more and more stressed I become. I've decided to go and enroll in a 6 month offline full-stack web dev bootcamp with emphasis on projects. I've done some basic JS in the college for the sake of learning something new but gave up soon and started smoking jays. Anyways, I want to ask what will be the starting salary that the companies/startups give ? Has anyone of you had the experience of going through a bootcamp and how'd it go ?

I am trying to figure out if some specific person named XYZ had gone missing during a certain period within the last 2-3 years. I've come to know from a few people that this person XYZ had run away from their home for a week or so and got married to some other person during that time, but returned home after that.

I am thinking that if any person would be gone missing for a week, a missing complaint must've definitely be registered in the local police station. Hence, is it possible for me to file an RTI application with that police station, and get the information of whether this specific person XYZ had gone missing during that period, and also if they became married during that time? 

I'm confused if this information is way too personal and might not be revealed by the police, or is it that the missing complaint is a public record and they could confirm that whether a missing complaint was filed for this person XYZ or not during that period.

My questions are:

1. There is an EPIC form 002- which is filled and submitted to the local electoral office- can the forms be submitted in Delhi for a Karnataka voter ID as she is unable to travel to Karnataka right now?

2. There is a confusion between Form 001 on the NVSP website and the aforementioned EPIC 002 suggested on other websites- which one is correct?

3. Her name seems to be missing from the electoral rolls for 2019- in this case, will it be better to apply for a new card in Delhi which is her temporary residence and then apply for a transfer to Karnaraka which is her permanent address?

4. As domestic staff, she has no proof of residence in Delhi- her accounts, Adhaar card etc are all in her Karnataka address. Her mobile is prepaid. What can be used as a proof of residence for someone like this if we go for a voter card in Delhi?

Only then there would be ideological diversification in the region, once people from other states are settled there. Biggest hindrance would be the state government of J&amp;K along with the local population (ofc). To curb this, people from Jammu and Ladakh region should side with the center's decision of revoking the article (if need be get more people in these two regions).  I believe there would be some protests, stone pelting, violence, and hatred towards India but let it be (it is already there &amp; this is the elephant in the room). 

Declare emergency in the state if need be. Eventually, things would come back to business as usual, as everyone would get used to it. Life never stops, especially here in India we get used to everything we can't work out (cleanliness, corruption, traffic along with other million things).

Coming generation would not even remember that such a thing even happened. The only requirement is if this thing is started then it should be taken to its end. Getting cold feet in between could even mean losing out the state from the Indian map. 

Another biggest challenge in implementing this would be the liberals and champions of democracy. They would find it very unconstitutional. But now or then we have to choose between the constitution and the reason, otherwise, just have to live with the way things are (the US is also declaring an emergency to get something done, coincidence? ).

The good thing right now is that this is an apt moment for this.  We cannot discuss these things when some local Kashmiri youth is injured/killed in the police firing. Also, elections are due shortly and no one would oppose seeing the public sentiments at the moment.

But the sad thing is we always miss out on the right moments of action. Be it the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits or some big terrorist attack carried out with the local support.

P.s: The whole problem is because of the hatred Kashmiri locals have for India. And I tell you, even we give them independence, the problem won't be solved (as they believe very wrongly). It would just change its form. If anyone is having any doubt on this, just look across the North-western Indian border.

[LONG POST],"Hi [r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india), I'm a PG engineering student (cse). I don't know exactly how to explain my problem, I hope people from [r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india)will not make fun of it and will provide some really helpful replies. All my life I have studied in top institutes of this country(earlier due to my intelligence and later due to my reserved category). From the past few years, I have become a (below) average student in life(since my class 9). Things are getting deteriorated from then. I find difficult solving higher secondary maths and don't know any calculus/derivatives. But still I got admission in top college due to my category. Now that I m in PG, when I study logic/any maths related stuff in cse, I find it extremely difficult to understand abstract concepts of it due to my weak knowledge of maths and logic. Problem is not just I don't know fundamental maths, problem is my mind has become dumb from last many years that it has lost its logical/abstract conceptual building capacity. Due to this I scored average GPA in UG. I have to study for much more time compared to my classmates, still I score way less than them(some of them study like a day/night before for exams yet score better). Even now, when the teacher explain some concept in class, my mind gets lost easily but when I focus I do understand some logical concepts(eg. tableau method logic) but I can only solve those questions on which I practices before; unable to do some other/slightly higher difficult questions which require logical solving power.

Sometimes, I want to die because I'm unable to cope up with studies/life/career(as I can't go back in time to study 9-12 maths again). Tried for govt job like ssc cgl but was eliminated from tier 2 because of low marks in maths.

I want to change my life and break this path of deterioration. I want to build again the conceptual/logical ability of my mind and re-work on my maths skill(at least those concepts which would be helpful for me in current course). Also, I am not street-smart which works as a double-negative for me.

What can I do to recover my long lost mind power and utilize it to develop? I don't do any meditation/exercise, will meditation help me focus better in class or study? Please help me!

P.S.- I am disabled person, hence unable to do excessive exercises(running) or go out seeking professional help. Also, I do watch porn and fantasize it a lot (another bad habit I want to get rid of, as many times, I fantasize it in class with teacher which lost my focus in lecture).

#Did Churchill Cause the Bengal Famine?

**By THE CHURCHILL PROJECT  | April 8, 2015**

Reviewing a recent book, The Churchill Factor, by London Mayor Boris Johnson, a reviewer repeated a widespread canard about Winston Churchill that really needs to be put to rest:

When there was a danger of serious famine in Bengal in 1943–4, Churchill announced that the Indians “must learn to look after themselves as we have done… there is no reason why all parts of the British empire should not feel the pinch in the same way as the mother country has done.” Still more disgracefully, he said in a jocular way that “the starvation of anyhow underfed Bengalis is less serious than that of sturdy Greeks.” This is more than amusingly politically incorrect language: it had real consequences. Three million Bengalis died of starvation. A true historian would not have neglected this in order to suggest that the imperialist was making a stand against ‘barbarous practices.”1

There’s a good reason why Mayor Johnson omits the now-famous accusation that Churchill starved the Bengalis: it is not true. Alas, in the words of a wartime statesman, “a lie will gallop halfway round the world before the truth has time to pull its breeches on.”2

The charge stems from a 2009 book accusing Churchill of irresponsibility over Bengal that amounted to a war crime, repeated by scores of sources since. As Churchill once remarked, “I should think it was hardly possible to state the opposite of the truth with more precision.”3

The truth—documented by Sir Martin Gilbert and Hillsdale College—is that Churchill did everything he could in the midst of world war to save the Bengalis; and that without him the famine would have been worse.4

On receiving news of the spreading food shortage Churchill spoke to his Cabinet, saying he would welcome a statement by Lord Wavell, his new Viceroy of India, that his duty “was to make sure that India was a safe base for the great operations against Japan which were now pending, and that the war was pressed to a successful conclusion, and that famine and food difficulties were dealt with.” (Italics mine.)5

Churchill then wrote to Wavell personally:

Peace, order and a high condition of war-time well-being among the masses of the people constitute the essential foundation of the forward thrust against the enemy….The hard pressures of world-war have for the first time for many years brought conditions of scarcity, verging in some localities into actual famine, upon India. Every effort must be made, even by the diversion of shipping urgently needed for war purposes, to deal with local shortages….Every effort should be made by you to assuage the strife between the Hindus and Moslems and to induce them to work together for the common good.6

Again Churchill expressed his wish for “the best possible standard of living for the largest number of people.”7

Next Churchill turned to famine relief. Canada had offered aid, but in thanking Prime Minister MacKenzie King, Churchill noted a shipping problem: “Wheat from Canada would take at least two months to reach India whereas it could be carried from Australia in 3 to 4 weeks.”8

At Churchill’s urging, Australia promised 350,000 tons of wheat. King still wanted to help. Churchill feared a resultant loss of war shipments between Canada and Australia,9 but King assured him there would be no shortfall. Canada’s contribution, he said, would pay “dividends in humanitarian aspects….”10

The famine continued into 1944, causing Secretary of State for India Leopold Amery to request one million tons of grain. Churchill, who had been studying consumption statistics, now believed India was receiving more than she would need. He remained concerned about the shipping problem, “given the effect of its diversion alike on operations and on our imports of food into this country, which could be further reduced only at the cost of much suffering.”11

The Cabinet cited other causes of the famine rarely mentioned in latter-day denunciations of Churchill: the shortages were “partly political in character, caused by Marwari supporters of Congress [Gandhi’s party] in an effort to embarrass the existing Muslim Government of Bengal.” Another cause, they added, was corrupt local officials: “The Government of India were unduly tender with speculators and hoarders.”12

Amery and Wavell continued to press for wheat, and in the Cabinet of February 14th Churchill tried to accommodate them. While shipping difficulties were “very real,” Churchill said, he was “most anxious that we should do everything possible to ease the Viceroy’s position. No doubt the Viceroy felt that if this corner could be turned, the position next year would be better.” Churchill added that “refusal of India’s request was not due to our underrating India’s needs, but because we could not take operational risks by cutting down the shipping required for vital operations.”13

The war pressed Britain on all sides; shipping was needed everywhere. Indeed, at the same time as India was demanding another million tons, Churchill was fending off other demands: “I have been much concerned at the apparently excessive quantities of grain demanded by Allied HQ for civilians in Italy, which impose a great strain on our shipping and finances,” he wrote War Secretary Sir James Grigg. “Will you let me have, at the earliest possible moment…estimates of the amount of food which is really needed….”14

Churchill and his Cabinet continued to struggle to meet India’s needs. While certain that shipping on the scale Amery wanted was impossible without a “dangerous inroad into the British import programme or a serious interference with operational plans,” the Cabinet grasped at every straw, recommending:

(a) A further diversion to India of the shipments of food grains destined for the Balkan stockpile in the Middle East. This might amount to 50,000 tons, but would need War Cabinet approval, while United States reactions would also have to be ascertained; (b) There would be advantage if ships carrying military or civil cargo from the United States or Australia to India could also take a quantity of bagged wheat.15

A month later Churchill was hoping India had turned the corner when his Minister of War Transport, Frederick Leathers, reported “statistically a surplus of food grains in India.” Still, Leathers emphasized “the need for imported wheat on psychological grounds.” What were they? Amery explained that “the peasant in 750,000 villages” might hold back “his small parcel of grain” if no outside aid was in sight. He said he could ship 200,000 tons, “provided that the twenty-five ships required were surplus to the Army’s needs.” But Amery wanted double that quantity.16

Again trying to help, the Cabinet suggested that India had underestimated its rice crop. While agreeing to send the 200,000 tons, Churchill told Amery he could get another 150,000 tons from Ceylon in exchange for excess rice: “The net effect, counting 50,000 tons previously arranged [was] 400,000 tons of wheat.”17

In April, it was Lord Wavell asking not for 400,000 but 724,000 tons! Now the problem was unseasonable weather and a deadly explosion in the Bombay Docks, which destroyed 50,000 tons of food grains. Peasants were still holding back their crops, he said; rumors were circulating “that London had refused to ask America for help.” The exasperated Cabinet retorted: “If we now approached the United States and they were unable to help, it would at least dispel that allegation.”18

One can sense Churchill’s frustration. Whatever they did, however they wriggled, they could not appease the continued demands from India—even after calculations showed that the shortage had been eased.

Churchill agreed to write President Roosevelt for help, and replace the 45,000 tons lost in the explosion. But he “could only provide further relief for the Indian situation at the cost of incurring grave difficulties in other directions.”19

As good as his word, and despite preoccupation with the upcoming invasion of France, Churchill wrote FDR. No one, reading his words, can be in doubt about his sympathies:

I am seriously concerned about the food situation in India….Last year we had a grievous famine in Bengal through which at least 700,000 people died. This year there is a good crop of rice, but we are faced with an acute shortage of wheat, aggravated by unprecedented storms….By cutting down military shipments and other means, I have been able to arrange for 350,000 tons of wheat to be shipped to India from Australia during the first nine months of 1944. This is the shortest haul. I cannot see how to do more.

I have had much hesitation in asking you to add to the great assistance you are giving us with shipping but a satisfactory situation in India is of such vital importance to the success of our joint plans against the Japanese that I am impelled to ask you to consider a special allocation of ships to carry wheat to India from Australia….We have the wheat (in Australia) but we lack the ships. I have resisted for some time the Viceroy’s request that I should ask you for your help, but… I am no longer justified in not asking for your help.20

Roosevelt replied that while Churchill had his “utmost sympathy,” his Joint Chiefs had said they were “unable on military grounds to consent to the diversion of shipping….Needless to say, I regret exceedingly the necessity of giving you this unfavorable reply.”21

There is no doubt that in those fraught weeks Churchill said things off the record (but duly recorded by subordinates) that were unworthy of him, out of exasperation and the press of war on many fronts. There is no evidence that Churchill wished any Indian to starve; on the contrary, he did his best to help them, amidst a war to the death.

I did my BTech in M.E. from IIT-Kanpur in 2012. I didn't really like mechanical and got placed in a tier-3 IT company (didn't join). 

I have since been involved in teaching students for IIT-JEE and medical entrance ( I teach chemistry) and right now am working in a well-known coaching. 

But now, I am looking for a career change as teaching has become a bit repetitive plus the work culture in these coachings is quite shit.

I don't have much programming experience except dabbling a bit in HTML, Basic, C, JAVA ( first sem course in college) and MATLAB. But I loved whatever little I did and ofcourse I love maths and logical reasoning too. 

Also I love videogames and tech in general so its not like I am just in it for the bucks. 

What domain in IT would you guys suggest a guy like me should look to get into? There are so many verticals, its damn overwhelming. I am ready to self-learn for a year or two and meanwhile teach chemistry part-time. 

All help appreciated. Have a good day :)

This was the most disappointing news for a lot of us teenagers and youth. Albeit these disappointments, soon BBM and later WhatsApp took over IM’s and now majority of people are not concerned about the 100 SMS limit anymore. Now, Communication is even more effective through these means. (Does MMS ring any bells? Look where WhatsApp got us now)

Whereas now, TRAI revised the channel subscription plan which gave an impression that it’ll work out cheaper than current packages, but it isn’t (as per my experience). 
With rigorous planning and downsizing from unlimited channels pack to limited channels pack, for the new amount that I’m about to pay currently I would rather use it on IPTV or online streaming services. 

Online streaming services are on the rise right now in India according to some random stats that I came across in the internet. Assuming majority of the population in urban areas, users have access to high speed internet and subscribe to online streaming services. 
We can save money on tv plans and rather invest in existing online services  and rely on internet instead of satellite broadcast (not entirely eliminate it though).  And moreover does the cost involved in broadcasting content via internet be cheaper than satellite??

The dots that I’ve tried to connect is; 
“Is the history repeating itself with TRAI (the shift to internet)? Does this mean we are going to experience less of dish tv experience and more of IPTV/online streaming services in the future?” 

What are your thoughts? Are there any different angles to this scenario?

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping that someone here could answer my question about trains getting delayed. I have often found that certain trains are delayed beyond their stated timings. I don't mean due to bad weather or an accident but just because the train stops on the outskirts of a destination for some reason before moving in. For example the Garib rath from Secunderabad to Yeshwantpur is almost always late by an hour. I'm guessing that this stoppage is to allow other trains to pass through the station on priority basis. What I don't understand is why is this an unknown factor? meaning, why can't they account for such things when they schedule the rain timing and give us a timing which is accurate to begin with? Also, how do they decide which train has priority?

1. Through RTI: By law, one could file an RTI and get access to that FIR. 
2. Through government websites: example. fir.gujarat.gov.in is a website where one can find details of any FIR lodged in police stations in Gujarat. 
3. Offline: By going to a particular police station, I could get access to an FIR assuming I have a valid enough reason to want access, or have an RTI request. 

(For research purposes), I am trying to access an FIR that was filed in Gujarat. But the fir.gujarat.gov.in website doesn't seem updated for the period in which this particular FIR has been filed.

And it was detained by customs indicating that an NOC is required from FSSAI.

\- Get the NOC from FSSAI

or

\- Place a return request.

Should be enough. Read adjoining points if more clarification is needed.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents live in ***Bhopal*** and are **looking for alternatives to a** ***BSNL broadband connection*** that they have had an ***EXTREMELY sour experience*** with due to overbilling, very weak customer service and redressal despite being with the company as users from 1990. They have asked me for advice (basically outsourced the recce required for the decision making). I am just about to begin my researching but have been a staunch believer of '1 se bhale 2 aur 2 se bhale 4' (2 are better than 1, 4 are better than 2) so that this research becomes more of a discussion and thus, becomes more rounded and reliable for the benefit of my parents as well as any others who might happen to read this post.

**User requirements (in priority order):**

1. **CUSTOMER SERVICE:** Should be **hassle-free, prompt and convenient.** They have literally been made to run to the BSNL offices over a period of the past 6 months to get back their dues because the online customer care and pgportal turned out be ineffective. At their age, they don't want to be dealing with this BS and would rather pay Rs.100 more per month for the convenience.
2. **SPEED:** They aren't satisfied with their mobile internet speeds which tend to be near the 7 Mbps mark when tested on [fast.com](https://fast.com). So **&gt;=40Mbps** but use your judgement. I'm **unsure if last-mile connectivity is still an issue** thereby hampering actual speeds, which as a result tend to be much lower than the promised ones. Pl. educate me in this regard.
3. **DATA QUOTA:** They already have unlimited mobile plans (2\*1.4GB/day) and thus curently, only require a broadband for work, ocassional Skype and basic surfing purposes. However, they are *SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING* dropping their Digital cable connection and depend on OTT services as well online streaming (such as Voot for 'Khatron Ke Khladi' etc) for their entertainment needs which last for only about four hours in the night since both are working. **100 GB with rollover should more than suffice** but I'll let you be the best judges of this.
4. **OTT BUNDLES:** Free subscriptions for Netflix, Prime, Hotstar etc.

After a very brief skim from the only 3 options I know of (Airtel v-fiber, Gio fiber and ACT), I zeroed in on the **Rs 699/799, discounted 20% for 12-month advance payment, V-fiber plan with 40Mbps, 100GB/250GB with rollover** but I'm open to all suggestions including considerations I might have missed as well as Cross-posting subs.

the app is not letting us transfer funds back to our banks or other wallets, its been like this since late December

their Costumer service never pick calls , if they do after 30mins on hold they say "" server problem try tomorrow""




#why its a  scam

#1 ::: false advertising and just trickery::::

when you download the app and deposit money into it , **they never mention that to withdraw your money back** you need to send them a physical hard copy of  a online application form to their main office in Mumbai by speed post. 

it is easier to just open a bank account in your area. **they do it intentionally** ,because most people wold rather loose their deposited  100 or 200  than going through weeks of paperwork and costumer care hazel . I only did it because i'm a gullible dumbass who deposited 5k on my first transaction.


#2::: their virtual card is fake and wont work:::

- most ppl download this app for this feature, only to find out every sites never take TMW virtual cards , unless your virtual card is verified by a reputed institute they will be rejected. TMW virtual cards are generic trash cards that you can get free on the net.

- it says master card on it, but it doesn't support international transactions. its a shit version of rupay, **this is clear false advertisement** because if you go their shopping section in the app its filled with westren ecommers brands like Ebay, dell, aliexpress  

- my friend spent a hundreds and got their physical cards, only to find out the ATM machines don't even recognize it


#3::: they have basically locked the users out from their money:::


**for nearly a month they haven't allowed its users transfer money back to their banks**, when you try to transfer it says ""issue with the server""  , yet you can still deposit money into it.

your only choice here is either wait forever where they probably slowly mooch of your  $ for maintenance or spend what money you have on their features like recharging or bill payment


#4::: lieing clueless morons in customer care:::

i was scammed from the day 1

- before i deposited my money(5k) ,i called the costumer care and asked them if i can use the debit card to buy shit from foreign gaming site, they lied . their cards are not accepted anywhere let alone gaming sites.

- after facing this problem i called again , now they tell me i need to activate my KYC to resolve this problem. nowhere did they warm me that this was basically a dummy account .

- after wasting a entire day(s) filling the application and waiting at the post office to send  this fucking package, i waited a week and called again, they now say to send it by speed post because my mail might be lost.

- after doing this shit again by speed post , it took 8days for my account to be officially approved, speed post to Mumbai from here can be sent in 24 hours, these slow ass mofos took a week

- no one picks up the calls , i have litrally spent 30-50 mins on hold, i have made it a trend to call them once a week .  i literally put it on speaker and do my work or drive or anything


#5::: shit app:::

most of the app is broken in general , you cant use most of their features



#any advice would be helpful

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tl;dr

TMW is ewallet , for over a month it's not letting people withdraw or transfer funds. Their customer service is non existent if they do respond they claim its a server problem

There's this storyline currently going on where a guy named ""Montu"" scams Gogi and gives him a soap bar in a phone box and takes his old phone and some money from Gogi.

Now here, the trouble starts. It bothered me quite a lot. Trigerred me, if you will.

The scamster, Montu, in the show is portrayed as this Westernized guy who goes to pubs, drinks, roams around with girls in short clothes on his bike.

What the show is doing here (consciously, or subconsciously) is telling us that people more aligned to the Western culture are such cunning people.

What bothers me about this is that I'm a guy who identifies more with western culture, literally my whole social circle is the same. But neither I or anyone I know would scam someone that way, or are bad human beings in general. 

What section of society does this show actually appeal to? I can't see educated, urban, grown up people truly liking the show?

Few days ago, I moved to my new flat in Hulimavu area of Bangalore and my [Jio speed just dwindled from 5 mbps to about 0.5 mbps](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/as79fy/open_letter_to_reliance_jio_from_an_indian/), thanks for listening to me.

Today, I discovered that the network issue is quite strange and erratic. For example, the moment I stepped out of the apartment block and started moving towards the exit, the dBm value dramatically decreased from -115 to -95 (signal improved a lot!).

I confirmed from my neighbors that this same thing happens with Idea and Vodafone too. Does that mean the tower signal of all these ISPs end just at my apartment block entrance? That just seems too weird. The alternative theory is that there is something in the apartment's infrastructure (hard materials, etc.) that doesn't allow mobile signals to pass through to the individual flats (I stay on the 3rd floor). But if I accept this theory, it doesn't explain the single exception - Airtel works remarkably well with full bars across the apartment.

Many radio stations across the world have declared they shall no longer play his music; TV series (The Simpsons) have pulled his appearance off their syndication and many such drastic revisions are set to follow. 

While many musicians, artists, athletes have had major transgressions - in India perhaps MJ's appeal has been the broadest (in my opinion).

TLDR Question of my post -Considering that politicians in states other than Delhi will not increase the minimum wage of call centre employees from Rs 8,000 to Rs 20,000 that they deserve for working 8 hours a day, considering that resources are limited but population is huge, considering that 74% of wealth is with just 1% people, considering that there are honest people in early 20's with arts background who want a job in which they give society what it needs and earn atleast Rs 20,000 per month without being in engineering field (at present they have options like compromise with morality and become a coachingwala, in which they earn money by not doing their job properly)...... What dobyou suggest to such honest people who do not want to do unnecessary jobs like tuition teacher or coaching wala?



So here I go with my long rant.......



Population is high. Government Jobs are limited. Not everyone can become a good engineer (if you motivate them to become one, Kota suicide is what you get. Motivating them in this case is an oxymoron in my opinion). Those who can not become engineer will open some coaching or Yoga class where they will ...

1 - Compromise with Morality - Basically fool the stupid and make money from them. Imagine there are two Indians in there early 20's with Arts background - X and Y.  X has made an informative ebook. X knows that anyone who gets that book will easily clear IAS, SSC etc. X joins a coaching institute as a professor where his Job is ""to give his best so that his students clear the exam""  So instead of donating the ebook to his students and give them right advice, X begins to speak things from his ebook in a class of clueless students in return for money. X starts making Rs 50,000 per month by teaching 8 hours. X makes money without doing his job - ""To give his best so that his students become IAS/PCS"".

 Y, who is friend of X , and has better ability in teaching and academics, works in call center for 8 hours everyday and gets just Rs 8,000 per month for a job that is frustrating. Y has no other option because he does not want to lie or fool people. Also, Because X lacks morality, he starts random conversations with girls in malls and places. 30% girls ask him to stop annoying them because they are not interested in dating. 50% girls smilingly reject. But 20% girls accept. Y does not care about the pass percentage. Y just knows that annoying people when they are not interested is unethical. Y is not lazy. Y just does not want to destroy collective needs of Earthlings for his own Personal Greeds.Y does not want to steal or destroy this planet. Thats his only fault.

2 - Compromise with quality of life - X wastes a lot of time sending fb requests,tinder swipes, messaging, skype calls, passing time on Omegle, creeping women, spending money on women even when there is no guarantee that the woman will give him emotional and sexual support that X craves for. Spending time on the greeds of random women instead of doing something for society. Infact, X plans to become IAS to make money out of corruption and so studies with more dedication and desperation



Now there is a problem with all this. Yes. I am jealous of X. Because he is taking advantage of loopholes in the system. Society in future , specially a densely populated developing country like India, could be full of people doubting each other because of risk of treachery, dishonesty and deceit.

So what do you suggest?

1 - Make extra money by not doing your job properly  which will set a bad example for youngsters in our society and fill them with frustrations?

or

2 - Make less than living wage for doing your job properly and suffer yourself in frustrations?

For example, I remember that every time Honey Singh's name comes up people make fun of his music. While I am not a fan but do you think Honey Singh would have never faced any competition in life and millions of people, even if we assume they have shit music taste, were just waiting for him to release a song? Was his way to fame, money or selling music a cakewalk. There would have been many people like Honey Singh and even though his music might not be aesthetically or artsitically rich it is still influential and liked by millions which is no easy thing imo. 

People can give the example of Dhinchak Pooja etc but those were memes which died out. And seriously how many people know about them?

In Bollywood Salman Khan would be an example. People act as if his success is totally undeserved but can you tell why he gets audience in theatres but other ripped, good looking actors do not? There have been other decent to good looking ripped actors who did action or romantic movies but failed. When you look at his specific case the guy arguably started the gym culture in India. Again his movies are not something that I would call great but in the end the guy still found how to sell his movies (when he was going through a rough patch at one point and made a comeback) which many other actors don't.

I feel that attracting audience and making yourself likeable is a very tough thing in itself and people or even other artists who undermine their success forget this fact.

Hey everyone,

I'm doing a research on behavioral finance and I'm really short on responses and I need a considerable amount of responses as soon as possible. I've exhausted all other sources and this subreddit was one of the only places I could think of who could help. I've seen you guys come together and help people and I really hope the same happens in my case.

It's a short survey should take you around a minute or two to complete. Do fill the survey out if you invest.

The research seeks to find out how cognitive and psychological biases affect individuals in the decision making process of investment options.

TLDR - 

TS = Traditional Schooling. 

NH = Nomadic Homechooling

In TS,  the teacher can not explain topics well with her face and words but in NH, the kid would simply watch videos that he can pause under the supervision of his guardian.
In TS, The teacher works for a monthly salary but in NH, guardian (father or mother) works for the future of his kid. In TS, The classmates of a kid might have a bad influence on the kid due to lack of knowledge or integrity but in NH, the kid would meet some new learned people everyday who will tell the kid what life is all about. In TS, the kid will not get a chance to experience the beauty of different locations and nature in India, but NH will give him that chance.

So here is what life in Nomadic Homechooling would be like.

6am - Alarm rings. There is a vanity van parked somewhere in Kullu. Amitabh, The 40 year old father who is location independent for his income wakes up. Rashmi, 35 year old mother who is a good caretaker of kids wakes up. Satya, 11 year old boy who wants to enter politics or social work wakes up. Shaurya, 13 year old boy who wants to become an expert in Artificial Intelligence wakes up. By turns, they all brush their teeth, take a shower and eat [Huel](https://youtu.be/RoheltLK-Ls) for breakfast.

7am - Amitabh starts the van and shows the beauty and people of Kullu to his family.They visit temples, parks, libraries, hospitals, schools etc. They sing, dance and celebrate while staying connected with the beauty of nature.

9am - Satya and Shaurya take their first class. They open the laptop, and watch their video lessons on English.

10am - Maths.

11am - Science.

12pm - Hindi and have Huel for Lunch.

1pm - German. (Escape plan if civil war breaks out in India)

2pm - Computers (Future would be all about machines, coders who will control those machines and lawyers and politicians who will try to control those coders in vain. So computers are important.)

3pm - Career ( Satya and Shaurya should know what's it like to work as a judge, a lawyer, a dentist, a cardiologist, a software developer, a social worker, an airhostess, a pilot etc. Untill they know this, they will never be able to connect with humanity.)

4pm - Amitabh starts the van and they leave for Manali while celebrating with music and songs.

8pm - They find a nice parking spot in Manali and have celebrations until 10pm. Satya researches on Politics and Administration. Shaurya does his research on AI.

10pm - Everyone sleeps. Next morning they wake up to repeat the same natural life.

I just want to know what you all think of this.

I have a US passport and a Bhutanese Passport. I entered India using the Bhutanese Passport, since Bhutanese do not need a visa and I had originally planned to exit to Bhutan.

But my travel plans have changed and I am flying back to the US. I understand that since I entered India using the Bhutanese passport, I have to show the Bhutanese passport during the exit immigration. But, Indian immigration also inquires about Visa to the country that a traveller is going to, so in my case, they will ask for a US Visa. Can I show my US passport to meet the visa requirements?

Or is my option to go to another country like Thailand(Bhutanese get Visa on Arrival, so the Indian Immigration should be good) and then when entering Thailand use the US passport to enter and move forward to the US?

The debate is over if it is black or (a really) dark blue. I've done my own research, but haven't come to any conclusions yet. Here are some of my findings:

\- Firstly, I know the Indian passport office calls the regular passport ""[deep blue](https://portal1.passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/online/faqServicesAvailable)"", but I feel this shouldn't be the ""answer"", and it needs to be verified based on the actual colour of a printed-out passport.

\- So I took some pictures of my own passport, one with the [flash turned on](https://i.imgur.com/EQA9XMF.jpg) and one with the [flash turned off](https://i.imgur.com/NZna49H.jpg) (red tint due to colour of my curtain).  It looks black to me!

\- [This post on mapporn](https://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/b1tzfv/map_of_the_world_according_to_the_colour_of_its/eipthex/?context=3) makes it looks like the colour is black? Not sure what the source is though.

\- On the passport index [website](https://www.passportindex.org/), it looks black.

\- A search on google led me to a few links with varying results: [Looks blue here](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/types-of-passport-every-traveller-in-india-should-know-of/as62630074.cms), [black on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_passport), [and blue here again](http://ibgnews.com/india-passport-seva-update-centralised-system-issue-passports/).

&amp;#x200B;

I feel one step that could be taken would be to get an example of a passport from a government website , and use a colour matcher tool on paint/photoshop/wherever and just see what that is. Then do the same thing with a picture taken of a physical passport to compare.

So if anyone could shed some light on this, I would really appreciate it, as it would satisfy my curiosity :) Thanks!",,b2frsf,,0,,false,1560222898,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,tamilnadumap,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b2frsf/what_colour_is_the_indian_passport/,,Tamil Nadu,false,AskIndia,

after some lifechanging event I have decided to do a lifechanging adventure. 

I just booked a flight for almost 8 weeks travel to India. I had a few questions I hope you could answer. 

(Though one of my parents was an Indian I do not know much about India, so I apologize before hand.)

I had travelled to india almost two decades ago, so my plan couldnt be perfect. So, please critique my rough-itinerary. 

8th Feb: Landing at Delhi Airport. 

8,9 Relax at Lodhi Hotel.

10,11,12 Delhi City + TajMahal(Agra).

13 - 18 Kanpur (visiting my prof. friend an institute in K'Pur  + The Great Varanassi !!! ).

18 - 25 Kolkata + Gaya + Flight to Mumbai.

25 - 4 Mahrasshtra + Goa 

5 - 14 Humpi + Mysore + Bengalore  (K'Taka)

15 - 21 Kerala ( + mum's native city - cochin)

22 - 25 to Chennai + Flight back home. 

Can you critique my plan?

Few questions:

1. I am a solo male traveller, would Is there something I should be aware of? - There is a stigma against solo male travellers, I have heard. 

2. is $5000 sufficient for  a wholesome stay?

3. I know its the election year out there, am I supposed to be aware of any possible mishaps during the time?

4. There was a flood in south India a few months ago, how is the infrastructure now?

5. Is some broken Hindi sufficient for getting around?

6. This questions is kinda touchy, I am not sure if I could ask it here. Anyways. I sound American but I look like a south Indian. In my past experience I have faced more rascism in North India than in the US (taxiwallahs grin and welcomed my gorah friends and told me that they thought I was a tourguide - Three occasions atleast).

7. In hyderabad, during my last visit, a guy told me ""I looked like a madrasi but doesnt sound like one, so where am I REALLY from?""

8. Are drones allowed in public?

Thats it for now, I guess, any other general advices are also welcome.

Thanks.

PS: I have read the travel wiki of r/india subreddit, the questions above were not solved by the wiki.

Looking for your advice. [AskIndia] [NP] [x-post from r/ChemicalEngineering]","My situation - I finished my degree in 2018, having studied a B.E (Chemical) and B.Sc (Chemistry) from a reputable Australian university. My graduation ceremony is in May. I have a pretty horrendous GPA (we don't actually have GPAs at my uni, but my average mark is around 65/100). Also, I feel this is somewhat of note, but I took 2 extra years to finish my degree (due to travelling and part-time study).

The recruitment cycle in Australia for structured grad programs begins in May/June and ends in October/November and whilst I did apply for many 'fresh' grad positions, I didn't get through to any. This means I've missed out on the typical grad positions unless I reapply this year, but I will be competing with people graduating in 2019, and this also means I will have to start in 2020. I cannot wait this long.

To be frank, so far, since completing my degree I've only applied for maybe 30-40 jobs. Of these 30, I've gotten to the interview stage for maybe, 3 or 4. I recently applied for a job in food processing and was pretty sure I was going to get the job, but in the end, I didn't and was pretty disappointed.

I've had a few internships, but the majority were in India (as it was easier for me to find work there). On my resume I have them listed. Some of the work I've done was in the pharmaceuticals industry and also bulk chemicals. I've also worked for one of the 'Big 4' in the Assurance/Advisory division, but didn't particularly enjoy the work.

I'm looking for work in any field really, but I wish to do core engineering work, not so much consulting or 'soft engineering'.

Right now, my main channels of finding jobs are just through the typical 'job sites' like Seek, Indeed, Jora, etc... but at the moment there are barely any advertised positions for recent grads. What am I doing wrong ?

I am considering going overseas to either India (since I have family there) or the US (less of a chance since there is a question of working rights). But I don't know what to do. I don't mind if I was to move to India and work with any multinational, as long as I get to learn as much as possible. I've heard from friends and family that there are many jobs in India for chemical engineers.

Should I keep looking here, in Australia? Keep in mind, I only finished my degree very recently. I'm nearly 25, and I haven't even yet begun my career which to me is really worrying.

Can you lovely people offer any advice/direction/guidance ?

Thank you kindly for reading this wall of text.

Now they are not refunding those false deduction even tho i have told asked them to suspend my services.

I try to avoid taking it regularly but once in a while it's super nice, especially when I know I'm gonna be up late and would like a clear head. My head is especially fuzzy if I take midday naps.

I have friends who suffer from more chronic conditions who live off the stuff. As well as a few (myself included) who use it to recover from hangovers (although only after rehydrating and eating).

Is it bad for my liver to take regularly? It's a combination of paracetamol and an analgesic or so. Available OTC in India and I haven't really seen it anywhere else though I haven't looked.

Dunno why I'm starting this thread. Late night Dart appreciation thread maybe but if anyone has medical insight it'd also be good I guess.

I represent a foundation which is planning to institute grants and scholarships for doctoral students in the social sciences in India. This is not a call for submissions!  Just questions to help me understand how things work in India. Appreciate input from folks based in India who have completed a doctoral level program in the social sciences/humanities in the last decade or so, or folks who are closely associated/collaborating with Indian academia. Please do not feel obligated to answer all questions - just one or two is fine! 

1. Is admission to a doctoral program separate from a Masters program or are the two combined? How does an M Phil. fit into all this? 

2. In the US, a doctoral student would typically cover expenses through a mix of teaching, research, tuition waivers, grants and scholarships etc. How does a PhD candidate in India meet their expenses? 

3. How much does it cost to go through a doctoral program at a state university like U of Delhi or JNU, versus a private institution like ISB in Hyderabad or IIM Ahmedabad?

4. Can you give an estimate of living expenses for students pursuing a program in a city that is not their hometown? Broad question I know but an estimate for major metro like Delhi or Bangalore and a second level city like Pune would help. 

5. How does a candidate typically meet research expenses when their thesis requires field research?

5. At what stage does a candidate settle on their thesis? 
 
And finally name what you think is the best social sciences school in India. Aside from the one you graduated from!

I recently passed my 12th class in 2018, and I didn't took admission in any college as I belong to Punjab and there is a norm of sending your children to Canada after 12th grade. But, I missed the January intake. Honestly, I don't want to go to Canada but my parents are forcing me as there are much better provisions in Canada and a student can earn money while studying. 

**I was wondering what career options do I have in India. I completed my grade 12 in Humanities(Arts) with 84% in finals. I had the following subjects :** 

* Multimedia and Web Technology
* Entrepreneurship
* Physical Education
* Punjabi
* English

I'm in a serious dilemma and have been depressed from past few months regarding this. My parents say there aren't much jobs in India, especially in Punjab.

Help me please, Fellow Indians!

* Retail jewellers take home 1-1.5% on the gold/silver  price (excluding the making charges).

* Medicals (Pharmacies) have profit margins of mere 7-9 %. They sell beauty and food products as these products have higher profit margins.

2. Fuck boards. 75% aa jaenge. Focus on JEE Mains 2. Get 180 ish. Go to DTU.
3. Fuck boards and JEE, prep hard for BITS.

Honestly, the most interesting option for me is DU. Feels right for some reason.

What other options should I be considering ?

\- Is going for Big4 and preparing solely for those type of interview is best bet because my interest area deep learning/ computer-vision interview require different set of questions (for example: explaining math behind backprop, SOTA methods).

So thank you to everyone who had been helping me with Indian names and I have taken your advice onboard. If you have read the previous post linked above, you'll know what I have been doing.

The names I have gone with, I've now changed drastically and I want to know if you lot believe they're fitting.

1. Pavan 'Pav' Kanidar has a new surname, it's now Maheswaran as having learned from a comment, the home of real life Indian racing driver Narain Karthikeyan is heavy in its history of automotive and thus I wanted to adjust Pav's origins to mean he came from Coimbatore. Pav becomes a team mate to my main character and subsequently a close friend, so you'll hear a bit about him, at least a tad more than some of the others.
2. Akshay Vinayagam's new name is Ram Kakumani, I didn't want to give this character much weight since he spends a lot of his time at the back and doesn't get far unlike the other two. Plus if you can't tell by his first name, Ram does have a meaning in motorsport, when you ram into someone, you crash into them.
3. Rajesh 'Raj' Bhushan is now Nadeem Rajkumar, not sure what else to add here but apparently the original name would have done no favours in trying to make him seem to be a sympathetic character as apparently it would have made him sound like a Delhi rich boy or something like that. I am basing this one off of a real driver called Arjun Maini, who had to put up with racist abuse from his Trumptard American team mate.

Alright so Pavan (or Pavanaj? Is that a name that exists) Maheswaran, Ram Kakumani and Nadeem Rajkumar. I ask also if all these names sound like they could come from very well off families since motorsport - like I said in my previous post - is very expensive. If all the names sound like they could come from places where there are known to have some rich people. Alright, thank you everyone :)",,b3jiop,,0,,false,1560242177,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b3jiop/follow_up_post/,,,false,AskIndia,

Need guidance about where/how-to apply for jobs ?,"**Hey guys , it's been about 7 months since i graduated last year . I am a fresher and  looking for a job for nodejs developer.**  I didn't apply for jobs much since i felt that i was not ready, what if i get laughed at or thrown out of the interviews. I always feared that i will be rejected , still do **. But fuck it , i am gonna take my chances now even if i am not ready .**

**Therefore, I was asking what to look for in companies/startups before interviewing for them ? and how do you guys know when you interview if that company will be right for you or not ?  I am looking to join a company where my seniors can support me and foster my growth.**

**The reason i am asking this  is because:**

1. I don't want to work for some web development shops like they have , you know.
2. **I have had a bad internship experience** . I interned in 2016 , i worked for free and didn't even get the travel allowance. The CEO used to hire recent graduates from noida universities on very cheap pay and train them through codecademy.  Sometimes I thought i knew more than some of those guys . After a month an employee got me out of that company because of an intern(female) i used to talk to and he was kinda jealous. They made me come from 9:30  to  6:30  for 6 days in a week and thought i will jack off to their Saturday evening parties( Their selling point was that we have amazing parties on Saturdays. chutiye sale). So i don't want to go into these kind of companies as well .

**I have been in js ecosystem since late 2016 and picked up things to learn and left it when it got hard and kept on switching between front end and backend and wasted a lot of time . I  rejected a college placement offer from infosys since i wanted to stay in development jobs**.

For last 6 months  I stuck to backend and been learning Node stack (slow pace i know ) and about to complete **freecodecamp's backend track and now i know some of the stuff.** 

***I am not good at DS and algo , so i am not expecting some  big product company will hire me*** . **I don't want to delay it any further now since employers will ask stuff about what i did in last year** and new kids will graduate as well , so more competition.

Ps: Most companies look for 2-3 years exp. I had **a walk-in interview for a company in noida about 4 months ago** . Though they were not looking for a fresher but my js and node stack knowledge impressed the interviewer but my logical skills might put her off . **She said that their hr will mail me but they never did .**",,ahzias,,0,,false,1552678713,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/ahzias/please_help_this_fella_get_a_job_need_guidance/,,,false,AskIndia,

Budget is maximum 4k. I'm looking for updated recommendations.  
   
My preferences are    

* one that uses a lithium ion battery (so charge time no more than an hour and no memory effect when charging)   
* run time of at least 60 minutes, more is better 
* can be used corded and cordless both (optional but would be nice) 
* can be used for both wet and dry shaving 
* would be great if it is comfortable to shave the back with it too  
  

Is the Philips QT4011 comfortable as a body and pubes shaver? Also any opinions on the Philips MG7715 and BT3221?   


Finally, it was really difficult to shave the back with the BG2024. Is there anything at all that will help other than those Mangroomer/Bakblade gadgets? Any long handles that can be attached to standard trimmers?

This being after I asked people of the SR's for Nigeria, Denmark, Belgium and Brazil for help with finding out how people were named.

So I am aware that there are a lot of languages in India, and thus I am not sure as to how these languages dictate the way people are named, if you lot can help me with that then please do. To finally give context, I am working on a novel about a racing driver, my main character is British but along the way, he meets and befriends an Indian driver and there are at least two others in my story.

I have names for all of them, and may I ask for you lot to tell me whether the names I give are accurate to wherever I say the drivers are from, or if the forename and surname are suitably matched, or where the person could be from in India if they had the name that they do.

Alright without stalling much more, here are the at least three Indian drivers I have names for:

1. Pavan 'Pav' Kanidar. This being the guy who my main characters becomes friends with, and he is from Mumbai.
2. Akshay Vinayagam.
3. Rajesh ‘Raj’ Bhushan.

Bear in mind, all the places where these people would be from would certainly have to be rather financially powerful, considering just how expensive motorsport is.

The income tax procedure suck too bad for non-CA community. You just can't get it filled properly, because of endless clauses and conditions ITR filling have. It isn't just the math you need to do of X% x Income, and done. While...

1. Calculate slab wise values, followed by CESS on tax.
2. Advance tax calculation and endless clauses of interests upon missing the date.
3. FX transfer rate as per their website and not total money credited to your account.
4. Endless calculations for stocks.
5. Interests calculation from all the sources.
6. And so on...

Even after all the things done, spending endless time and energy on calculating return. You remain in continuous fear of getting IT Notice and may end up paying even MORE due to any accidental mismatch (to CA, as bribe, as fine, as interest, etc). 

Is this really the best process we can have?

I have questions about the common usage of scripts in India specifically for writing/typing in Hindi,"Hello /r/india, I'm really hoping you guys can help me with this.

I'm wondering about the usage of scripts in India when it comes to writing the Hindi language. From what I understand, the traditional script for writing Hindi (Devanagari) is taught in schools, I believe up to high school. I also believe that newspapers, government documents, and ads/billboards that are in Hindi will also use the traditional script, rather than writing Hindi words with the Latin script.

What about common communication though? I think that most people know how to read and write in the script, so if you're writing something out by hand, you'll probably use the script, right? But I'm also wondering about TYPING, i.e. using a keyboard, communication over the internet, etc. How common is TYPING the Hindi language in Devanagari script, as opposed to simply using Latin letters to spell out Hindi words? 

I have read online that typing in the script is rare, and that most Hindi speakers will opt to use the Latin script when typing e-mails, messages on the internet, or just typing on a computer in general, even when the language they are writing is Hindi. Is this true? What is your personal experience of this, writing vs. typing in the Hindi language, in terms of what script you use to do it?

I have read also that most Indians just own the standard QWERY keyboards with Latin letters, and Devanagari keyboards are very uncommon. And that only 1/100 keyboards sold in India have support for the traditional script. Is that true? If an Indian needs to type things in Hindi on a keyboard in Devanagari, would it be easy for them? Are Indians in general well-practiced in specifically typing in Devanagari, or is it mostly just Latin script typing and it would take some practice to get used to Devanagari typing?

Any help would be appreciated, I really need to know the common writing practice in India, specifically when it comes to typing in Hindi. And I need to know the level of expertise that the typical Indian might have for typing on a Devanagari-supported keyboard.

I currently earn ~5 crore INR per annum, but from what I've heard, engineers in India don't typically earn more than a couple of lakhs per month. Is that true, or is it possible to earn more working in specific areas (e.g. finance), or if you have significant experience?

I'm young enough to venture into a new field, even if it requires some more education. One of my uncles is an IAS officer who earns more in India than I do here, but I'm not sure if that's common or exceptional.

1546412827,india,krmarshal,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/abr0nd/relationship_advice_cannot_think_of_a_more/,37,5,,,Relationship advice - Cannot think of a more descriptive title now,"Tldr: girl broke up with me approx year ago. No contact since then. She texted me for New Years and we had a conversation. She had a very shitty life after our breakup and she has now given up on her life completely. Almost Engaged to another guy now but says she still have feelings for me and would like to be in touch

&amp;#x200B;

I am in a really difficult situation right now and would need some perspective from a third person. I used to date a girl long back and we broke up in late 2017. I was in strict No contact mode and never even looked at her pictures/Facebook etc. I assumed that she would be happy as she initiated the break up and it was very messy for me as I did not see that coming. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now all of a sudden she texted me to wish for New Years and I initially ignored it. She then called me and I picked up. From the first word itself I knew that she still have the same feelings for me and it was like we never broke up. We talked for hours and she then told me about her life in the past year. Her closest family member passed away during that year and there were a lot of health issues in her family. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her social life also took a hit as she is now left with only one friend in her group. They used to be like 5 people in her closest friend circle and all of them drifted apart. After that death in her family, her parents emotionally manipulated her to agree for a marriage that she is not really into. I know what kind of life she used to picture for her and it is definitely not what she is signing up for with that arranged marriage. When I asked her about this, she says she is not interested anymore with what happens in her life and she doesn’t care now . That part worries me a lot. She says she still have the same feelings for me and still would have the same even after her marriage. But she was feeling very guilty all this time to contact me as she broke it off earlier and hurted me a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

From my end, I used to think that it would made me happy if she suffers in her life because how she broke up with me. But now I feel very bad that I was not there for her when she needed me the most. I know that it was not my fault and she could’ve texted me earlier but i still feel bad about it and I don’t know why. I don’t even like how she is throwing her life away like this now. I really don’t know what to do.  

&amp;#x200B;

When she called me she told me that she is going to resign her job before going to her hometown for the marriage. She also said even though it is wrong to do so, she wanted to be like my long distance gf now Atleast until she goes back to her hometown. She is basically engaged now to another guy. But she wanted to talk to me like earlier days and be together till she goes back to her hometown. She also did not tell that other guy about me and she is not planning to do so in the future as she intends to keep in touch with me ( just basic convos, nothing romantic ) after marriage. I convinced her against the idea of being together till she goes back but she insists on keeping touch after marriage. I want to help her but I really don’t know what to do. I do still have feelings for her but she says things are out of hand now. I cannot ask her to tell her parents upfront that she cannot marry that guy as I am not  100% sure that my parents would accept her. At this stage it is very risky for her to get out of that marriage.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not able to think straight at all about this. Any perspective/advice would help me a lot. My gut says that I should never contact her again and we both still have very strong feelings for each other and I am not able to see her throw her life away like this. I thought it would make me happy but this pains a lot.",,abr0nd,,0,,false,1552573315,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/abr0nd/relationship_advice_cannot_think_of_a_more/,,,false,AskIndia,

Now, there are some questions I did not get satisfactory answers to online:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Except ADF in the L6170, what are practical differences between the two?

\* How long can i leave an Ink Tank printer be without printing anything, i.e. how often should I print as a maintenance exercise?

\* What really is the maintenance box in L6170, because L4160 probably does not have one?

\* If I want to keep the store the printer away for a few months (if at all it can be done), how do I clean out the entire ink so that no coagulation in the tank itself or on the print heads?

\* Is there any other model to look out for in the same range as these two (around 20k)?

\* Is it absolutely necessary to use genuine ink bottles (I can get a set on Amazon for less than half the original set)? Does a little mix up between the two affect print quality, and/or problems in printing.

\* How susceptible are these type of printers to dust, humidity (or dryness) and temperature? I have a laser printer that is pretty sturdy, and wonder if these can be use in a relatively roughshod manner as any other laser.

\* If one of the three inks (CMY) runs out, do I have to refill it to continue printing, or does it do so with black alone?",,arhxpd,,0,,false,1553199084,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/arhxpd/few_queries_about_ink_tank_printers/,,,false,AskIndia,

Now to get this information you just need to fill a basic captcha and type the name. Now if you even just type ""A"" and leave all other fields blank, you get data of about 20 crore citizens starting with the letter A.

Lets say the parents of the guy are okay with hookups and relationships with any girl. But the girl parents could possibly be strongly condemning about such relationship. Neither the guy nor the girl knows about it.The girl, after meeting the guy  for few days, agrees to make love with the guy in OYO. But the parents of the girl have no idea about such relationship. Both guy and girl agree that after they have sex in OYO, they will only meet to have further sex in OYO. They will not meet in public for time pass because they both want to reduce the risk of getting caught.

Now I have 2 questions...

1. Is there any chance of parents of the girl finding about the relationship by using tactics like OYO directory search etc.

2. What can the parents do if they know about this sexual relation? If the parents are middle class crazy normies, what can they do against the guy or girl? If the parents are powerful/rich crazy then what can they do against the guy or girl? Logically asking, would such sexual relation be worth the risk?

I'd gladly remove/move it, if anyone can suggest a better alternative sub.

I am traveling to Phuket tonight and will be there till 25th February (Monday). I am a college student and I recently gave interviews in the big 4s for internship and am waiting for a response by the respective firms within this week (20-23 February)

From what I've heard the Big4s either e-mail or call to inform the candidature/results/further process of recruitment.  If they e-mail it's no problem at all, but the problem arises if they decide to call me. 

I USE AIRTEL PREPAID SIM AND WILL BE CARRYING THE SAME NUMBER TO PHUKET.

What I wanted to know is 

1. Whether they'll be able to connect to me normally or would they have to use any additional ISD codes etc? 

2. Whether I'll be able to *recieve the notification for any incoming calls on my phone* without any International roaming packages?

Thank you in advance!

Let me begin this post with a bit of a background. I purchased an item (a wrist watch to be precise) while I was in the US last year. I carried it as a ""personal item"" while flying back to India. Flash forward today - it needs repairs. So I've to ship this item to the nearest service center (under warranty, with all the necessary paperwork for warranty RMA), out in Switzerland. 

Now, I was considering Indian post as an option to send this wrist watch (marking it as ""export"" for repairs ??) to Switzerland via this International Mail service (with doorstep delivery). My skepticism lies around Indian Customs' office and their reputation of ""lost"" items or item hoarding due to plethora of trivial reasons (based on what I've heard and read online). Should I be worried about the same? Also, what is a likely scenario when the service center reships this item back to me, once the repairs are complete?

I also considered DHL/Fedex, but their shipping rates are insanely high (400% of what Indian post charges otherwise). 

Let me know your experience if you've ever sent any item overseas for repairs.

Then there is the act of belonging to a different social class or religion.

Next, we have complexities of sexual orientation - gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, cis-gender, asexual, intersex, queer, and whatever else they keep adding with a + sign at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

This forum has been an amazing find for me and I owe you guys a lot for what I have learned and what I am today.

Now, this is going to be a post straight from the heart so bear with me :)

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to write a book on my father in my native language (Marathi), and seeking assistance for ideas from experts, writer, readers and everyone who want to helps.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I have done so far:**

\- Have initiated reading Marathi literature greats such as Pu La Deshpande, Va Pu Kale, Vishwas Patil etc. Writing Marathi is not my forte, however, I do write poetry mainly in Marathi since I have been influenced by one of my mentors and it comes out naturally.  So, STANDING ON THE SHOULDER OF GIANTS is what has and will continue to keep me in good stead.

\- Taking Neil Gaiman's Masterclass on storytelling, Shani Raja's Class on being a better writer. Have collected e-Books on being a better writer such as: On writing &amp; Bird by Bird.

\- Learning Scrivener on its Trial version to get a feel of high-performance writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Assistance I Seek:**

\- ***Marathi Author/Book Recommendations:*** Need some good food for thought which shall act as a reference for my writing style. The same way Wodehouse, Ayn Rand and ~~Chetan Bhagat~~, Ruskin Bond have had on my writing ;)

Recommendations on greats writer who have written books about their fathers should also help. E.g: V.P Kale has written a book 'Sange Vadilanchi Kirti' (Singing my Father's Praise) which has given me some great ideas. 



\- ***Ideas of writing a Biographies:*** Needs inputs on what the readers might like as the structure of the biography: Major life-events, achievements, interviews with his school friends, the lives of people he has touched over the years etc.. 

I do plan to have interview with his friends and well-wishers, So any inputs on the questions or areas which I should touch upon will be of immense help. 

   

\- ***Learning Resources on writing:*** Books, Courses, Podcast (anything which shall help me write that Fantastic Book)



You might say, Dude, you have already done so much, just stick to it. But, being from a management consulting background I understand the importance of an Outsider's Perspective. So feel free to throw your ideas at me, I'll be more than happy to be overwhelmed with your suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers,

A Loving Son

&amp;#x200B;

Clear tax DOES NOT mentions  sales commission or distribution commission even once in the workflow of getting an ELSS.

&amp;#x200B;

Simple arthritic tells me It's a loss to NOT to stop clear tax's elss funds and it's a loss to NOT stop clear tax from having authority to deduct money from my bank account, and invest fresh in those same funds and still get more returns.

Please suggest me some diet which don’t include oil and sugar which can make me loss weight and don’t make me groggy and make me productive and make me feel light weight. 

I don’t eat anything from outside restaurants. 

I go to gym and lift decent amount of weight, so I also need fuel too in my diet.

Typically I only eat home cooked food like Dal, Roti, Chawal, Sabzi and eggs and curd.

Also if I eat Dal Chawal or Rajma or Channa they make me feel bloated and I feel gas a lot and it tanks my productivity and makes me feel fat and shitty and I don’t feel like doing anything as I keep burping.

The main thing I eat is namkeen which constitute lot of fat, but on the other hand I don’t eat sugar at all. I drink tea without sugar and I don’t like sweets at all.

Also I stay at home all the day preparing for some exam. So I only do gym for an hour and half hour normal pace walk in park after dinner, but mostly my lifestyle is sedentary, sitting reading  and preparing. 

So please suggest me some diet for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner which don’t contain typically home cooked daily things and help me lose weight and I feel light as feather and healthy! So, I can study for long hours too w/o feeling weakness in body.

Any idea what this is about? I will be going to the local store to see if they have any better idea, though I *highly* doubt it.

I called 198 (again) and talked to a representative (again). They were mostly clueless (as usual), but did give me important information.

Thing i've noticed is that my local ISP is blocking all the incoming ports. Yes all of them! There is no issue with port forwarding because i can see ports opens as soon as i connect my mobile data. This mean that even though i can download the torrents the seeding is not working. This is deal breaker for me because i mostly use private tracker sites and if i do not seed there i will get banned.

&amp;#x200B;

So i decided to called my ISP about this and they said they are indeed blocking it and If i wanted to ports i'll have to buy static IP service from them which costs around 2K INR per year. Note this is add-on i will still have to pay my internet bills.

&amp;#x200B;

Crazy thing is I just found out that we have two internet connection at my work place. One network is with static IP and one is without. I can see ports are open on the one with static IP but not on the latter. I've been using internet connection in mumbai since mid 2000's, since when did this became major issue? I was wondering if this is new norm in India or atleast here in mumbai where ISP are just blocking the ports and forcing customer to buy there static IP service?

&amp;#x200B;

Is anyone else here facing similar issue. if so what have you tried to overcome this? Did you find any workaround or did you buy ISP's service? You suggestions/experience is appreciated.

I will travel from Chennai to Kuala Lumpur and from Kuala Lumpur to DPS(Bali) in mid feb. The air line is Air asia.

Here's the tickets which I have booked : Air Asia(flight AK10) MAA-Chennai(8.05h) to KUL (14.30)

And from Air Asia (AK378) KUL (16.15h) to DPS(bali)(19:25h)

The layover time between those two flights is just 1h 45m. Would it be sufficient? I will be with my wife and also we're going on a honeymoon. Would there be rush? Also note that it's my first international tour so.

Any suggestions?
I have read about fly thru but I did not get the whole process.

I am tempted but I have never purchased from eBay International before.

This will force me to join AMITY's or some other college affiliated with UPTU's MCA program because my parents won't allow me to drop another year.

I've been a mediocre student all my life and belong to a lower middle class family.3 months ago something transpired which has finally kicked my butt into action.


I really want to do my MCA the ""right way"".But i can't drop another year to get a proper shot at one of the NITs,which means that i'm gonna have to make do with a private college or my shitty state university.


The problem with the likes of Amity is the inordinate amounts of fees they charge,while the problem with with colleges affiliated with my State university(UPTU) is that no respectable recruiter has heard of them,in addition to the piss poor standards of education.

So,i'm looking for colleges with moderate acceptance rates which won't prove to be a total waste of my parent's money.The only things that i'm looking for is a recognisable name and per sem fees lower than 70-80K.

Completed BCA from Lucknow university in 2018,passed 12th in 2015 with PCM.

When he died, the son ""inherited"" the whole property - none of the sisters live around, and have not seen what was in the grandfather's will.  The son had made sure that none of the sisters could visit him for the last 5-6 years of grandfather's life term. So it is very likely that the grandfather very likely had put in the whole estate in the son's name, so none of the sisters bothered to challenge this.

Now: My mother came to know from one of her sisters that their father (who has expired in 2014, so much after Sept 2005 SC ruling) inherits some ancestral property from his grand-uncle. This sister is the youngest daughter (my mother is the middle), and was approached by the brother, who claims that my grand father had a will which stated ""if any ancestral property were to come by, this should be divided equally between my uncle, and the youngest daughter since she is unwed"". Now, this youngest daughter is married long before 2014 when my grand father died, which suggests that this statement in the ""will"" is either from an older will, or otherwise that old will in the last will which was ever written (we don't know).

Either way, without legal background, but based on two supreme court rulings (below) considered together, it would look like whatever may or not have been in my grandfather's will, all his four children should have equal rights to the ancestral property which has come by the family's way?

&amp;#x200B;

So I need two pieces of advice: 

1. Is the inference I am making correct, that grandfather could not legally omit any of the children to inherit the ancestral property, irrespective of whatever may have been in his will? Furthermore, if he had a later will (note that the one in which he allocates ancestral property to one son and one daughter was decades old, and if grandfather had any new will, this would be superceded: so if the new will had no mention at all about ancestral property, then there's also that)

 2. If so, what would be the legal course of action, to, foremost determine what was in his will, and secondly, to get a fair share of the inheritance from the ancestral property.

All time favorite songs are Ranjish hi sahi, Afreen Afreen, Hich Amuchi Praarthana, Swades,  Zariya(ARR coke studio), Roya Re, O re piya etc. Songs in all languages are awesome but for me there's something about Urdu which is really special like I can't explain it  maybe Javed  Akhtar would know the word for it.  


P.S no hate for Spotify please, if you are disappointed with Indian version then download usa version apk. It's probably the best thing happened to music (using it since 2 years) like the algorithm is really amazing and I usually listen to something new mostly non vocal sound or something with no restriction of country,genre or language or year but the player knows I will like it. After a stressful day just coming to home and asking google home ""cheer me up"" and it will play something which mostly makes me think ""afreen afreen"" (praise to its creator).

I'm writing a paper on US expats and what effects they have on the most popular destinations. According to our government, over 700,000 American citizens are currently living in India which makes your wonderful nation something like #4 on the list.  

So my questions are:

Are Americans taking up jobs/resources that you feel should be going to Indians or contributing to cultural/economic problems?

Are they developing any kind of reputation or stereotypes as a group?

Do you feel that Americans coming to live and work in greater numbers has affected India in any significant way at all?

The problem is that nobody in the media industry requires a part time worker. So I'm turning to reddit to check if there are interesting opportunities where I can fit in without giving up my music.

1. Did Ajith Doval really decide to use a prototype drone built by an Intern for such a strategically significant operation ?
2. Do the natural caves on the LoC really exist that is used by the terrorists still not guarded by the Indian Army, if such a thing exist, isn't it a major embarassment and failure on our side ?
3. Idris the terrorist who is shown in the film as the handler of the Uri terror attack, who is the real life counterpart of this character ?
4. Are there any accounts that the Indian commandos crossed the LoC on foot and came back on foot after the surgical strike ?
5. And most importantly did Modi really consult his cabinet members, like it is shown in the film that Parrikar and Rajnath Singh were consulted before striking Pakistan ?

I have been living in a non-metro city for past few years and recently shifted jobs (Company A and B) and houses (House H1 and H2) both.

**Backstory:**

Concerned apartment (and other unknown businesses) is/are owned by a lady ""F"", whose husband ""M"" holds an ""Irrevocable Power of Attorney"" for all things owned/operated/etc by F. Account provided to me to transfer rent every month belongs to daughter ""D"" (no idea if it is joint account). M had sent me his HUF PAN card photo before the agreement was done.

Due to some issues, broker who showed the flat was out of picture during actual registration of agreement - which happened at sub-registrar's office and not online. M was never asked to submit his individual PAN or even present F's PAN.

All rent transfers were always online (IMPS or NEFT) from the my same account to the provided D's account.

**Actual Issue:**

From April 2017 to March 2019, I have been staying at the H1. The rent was initially little less than 14k and then after 11 months, me and my owner mutually agreed to extend the agreement (over a phone call), in which he also proposed an increase in rent of rupees 1000/-. Later, in a next call few days later, he asked me to 'pay rounded amount' as the rent which was exact 15k. I obliged to his terms all the times.

Now, when in January 2018, I had asked him for PAN, he said he'll talk to his lawyer and decide. Later, he declined giving it to me. Because I was not in any taxable slab, CA at company A only showed &lt;1 lacs as rent paid and it was fine. This CA was not fine with M's HUF PAN as owner's PAN.

Coming to January 2019, I was confident owner would not provide PAN but still gave a call and to my surprise he said yes. He kept on prolonging actually giving it to me citing ""TDS would be cut"". I told him he's a Self Employed person, so no one is going to cut TDS from him. He still never gave it. LOL. So even for FY18-19, CA at company A used 8000/- as rent paid every month as I was still out of tax slabs (submitted original agreement copy and bank statement - was never asked to submit rent receipts, and no PAN was submitted here).

End on Jan, I switched jobs. Company B CA did not have a problem with HUF PAN and asked me to submit rent receipts with HUF PAN mentioned. Also, when I explained him the scenario, he asked me to address rent receipts to ""M"" instead of ""F"" as I had previously done.

Rent for H1 has been paid until March 2019, but I shifted to H2 (rent 22k) around mid March and paid equivalent rent there too. H2 has a registered agreement from March 2019 which allowed me to shift mid month because of an emergency.

**Important Note:**

I don't care how M or F move their money around (may be in millions, has political family and is from rural west MH).
All I care is saving my money and not paying his taxes - now that I am taxable. And not legally implicated.

**Questions:**

1. Whose PAN should actually have been provided/asked by me during registration of agreement?
2. Submitting rent receipts for first time: Legal issues for forging M's signature (for actual rent paid as he would never give signature voluntarily)?
3. Given that actual registered agreement period was over after 11 months but I was actually staying there for 13 months more and paying electricity bills and rents (all online) prove I was still a resident at the flat?

Question 3 assumes that I get IT query after owner declares signatures forged, declines I was resident or paid rent for period after agreement.

Thanks to all for your time and help.

TLDR: Verbally extended rental agreement has no PAN as owner/attorney does not wish to provide it. Forging signature on receipts for actual rent paid online every time.

Broadband connection being one of them.

I've been using JCN internet for almost an year now and few months ago, they changed their servers (or so they say) and ever since the switch, I've been getting horrendous Packet Loss (can be easily spotted if you ping 8.8.8.8 -t in cmd, it shows as Connect Time Out).

I've been complaining about it in the local office for at least 2 months now and they don't really seem to care, even though the guy who sometimes comes knows what I mean, the company itself doesn't seem to care.

Now there's no real alternative to the broadband connection other than JCN and MTNL (which is worse) and I haven't been able to play a single game in months without pulling my hair out, yet they don't ever forget about the monthly payment which they always come to get on time.

I'm looking for a way to somewhat scare them into doing something about it since it's been real annoying, the packet loss is so horrendous that sometimes my bank transactions don't go through and I have to do it all over again.

Any suggestions are welcome and if you know people from Jangra Cable Network (i.e JCN) then please do let me know of the same so I could directly talk to them.

Very rational person who is opposite of trump. He is demanding minimum wage in US to be increased from 7$ per hour (Rs 1,17,600 per month) to 15$ per hour (Rs 2,52,000 per month).

Now considering India's 4x Density and a developing economy, I think we can set the minimum wage atleast 30% of USA's target - 15$ per hour. Which means 4.5$ per hour in India. (Rs 75,600 per month). I know its too much because of purchasing power difference. So lets make it half - Rs 37,800 per month. Well fuck it - round it off to Rs 30,000 per month, which we all have felt, is the starting point of a comfortable life in India.

Kejriwal is demanding (or maybe fixed already) Rs 15,000 per month as minimum wage. I dont know national minimum wage.. maybe Rs 7,000 per month.

So my question is...

Have we all become so used to living a pathetic life that even a minimum wage of Rs 30,000 per month sounds too much to us or am I applying some wrong principles of economy and mathematics here?


Edit 1 - Sorry people, I just checked that India's density is 12x to that of USA. Population is 4x but density is 12x because USA's land area is bigger than India.

1550958775,india,ComprehensiveSurgery,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/au0lt2/bad_tenant_story/,12,7,,,Bad tenant story,"Hello randians,

Just remembered this story that happened 3 years ago. 

My dad has been renting out an apartment in Delhi since 2005.He is always careful about the choice of tenants (young families, educated bachelors, etc.. you get the gist).  In 2015 he rented out the apartment to this young guy from Chennai. Good paying job, recently married with one child. Basically as secure as it can get in terms of a tenant. 

At the end of a year, the tenant had to move due to professional obligations and gave the standard 2 month notice.
Except that the day that he was supposed to check out, he requested us my dad to come in at 2 pm for the apartment verification but suddenly called him in the morning and told my dad that he had to leave earlier as the movers were in a hurry. He said also “I’ve tried my best to clean everything but there is some minor damage. Please be gentle “
Since he seemed like a trustworthy guy, my dad agreed and said that he will do the apartment check at 2 pm as agreed and inform the tenant in case of any damage.

Now, I always helped out my dad with managing this part of the renting.  When I entered the apartment, I was shocked with the state of the apartment. The tenants child had scribbled all over the walls, drawers in the kitchen and bedroom were damaged, the kitchen shelves had not been cleaned for a year and were swarming with cockroaches and there were cobwebs and ants everywhere in the house. The utility area had 2 feet of water piled up due to a leaky washing machine which was now swarming with dead cockroaches and rat shit.
I called up a cleaning agency who put the estimate at 35,000 for cleaning up the place and painting the walls.

When I finally called up the tenant to inform him of the damage, he lost his cool,said he was being cheated, abused me with a collection of colorful swear words and hung up. Over the next 2 weeks, I tried to be reasonable with the tenant, I shared the photos of the damage, the bills shared by the cleaning agency and also the explanation on how i was forced to spend my personal time on making sure all this was done since no other tenant would want to rent this apartment in the current state. Each time I got a response of being called a cheat and further threats of legal notice.

Finally, fed up with this arguing, I consulted a lawyer friend who advised me that I was in the safe (considering I had documented the damage with photos and  dates, the tenant in the mails had agreed to the damage, plus the bills I shared were reasonable and were not exorbitant). He advised me to go on the offensive and threaten a counter suit asking for damages to cover lost personal time and also harassment by the tenant (the mails with the colorful language all played in wonderfully here).

Long story short, after my threat to file a counter suit, i got a nice apology mail from the tenants wife and she also was in agreement to the amount to be deducted.  The matter was closed in a days time.

So, dear randians, share with me your horror stories of the worst tenants !

After a lot of stress in my life I have decided to put all my stuff in storage and return to India for a few months of travel. In 2015 I visited for a month and visited Rishikesh, Goa, Varanasi, Udaipur, Jaipur, Delhi and Mumbai.   
  
For this trip, I do not have a definite return date or timeline. I am not entirely sure what my goal is, but I want to see more of the country, go more off the beaten path, listen to and play with musicians, and learn more about hinduism. I may also end up doing a yoga teacher training later on in the trip.  
  
I have some things in mind, such as visiting Kerala, Darjeeling, Bengal, and venturing north to Punjab and Himchal Pradesh . . . but I don’t know specifically where to go in these areas. I also would love to visit Hampi this time, and spend more time in Varanasi, as well as see more of Mumbai ( I have a friend there who will be showing me around but I’m open to suggestions).  
  
I am less interested in super touristy stuff (I lived in New York City for 3 years and never went to the statue of liberty or the empire state building, for example) and I’d really like to focus on meeting people and also finding musicians to jam with/talk with, as I’m a musician here in the USA.   
  
Sorry if this post is very vague, but this trip is vague. I’m flying into Mumbai later in March, then flying into Sri Lanka for a week to visit a friend, but then I think I may try to start in South India and work my way up.  
  
Interested to hear if anyone has ever done a meandering trip like this in India, or has any destinations they’d recommend.  ",,az89hg,,0,,false,1560163776,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/az89hg/looking_for_travel_recommendations_second_trip_to/,,,false,AskIndia,

Men have become more comfortable with showing affection towards each other, but we’re still plagued with the “no homo” attitude if men hug or show other signs of affection at times. In a lot of photos of Indian friends, males make hearts with their hands or use lovey, “feminine” emojis and I’m just curious as to how masculinity and male friendship is viewed in India with comparison to the west. It doesn’t seem like the gay hysteria is as strong, or at least, men hand in hand does not = gay in India. 

Culturally, what is different about male friendships and masculinity in India, along with displays of affection? How are gay people viewed? What *does* make someone appear to be “gay”?

So, I have been feeling like shit for a while now. And I got my bloodwork done twice(I have all the symptoms of hypothyroidism) by thyrocare. But, everything came normal,except some weird,but not so serious, form of anemia, high homocysteine and low VitD(which everyone has).

&amp;#x200B;

I have switched to a healthy lifestyle last year. And recently, I have started exercising at home with dumbbells. But, I dont feel any better.  Feel like shit!  Its really hard to even get from bed, because my body aches badly. Zero motivation to do CERTAIN things like having a convo, exercising, running(i have stopped, it used to feel great I remember),etc. Just want to get things over with, whether it be conversation or an outing. Like as quickly it gets over the better. I have become indifferent. Everyday feels the same. There are reasons to believe that I might be depressed. But, that's not true. There are things, that I am motivated about. Like super motivated.

I also am kinda forgetful, mindless, you know what I mean. Sleepy! I talk about something and then go off on a tangent. Even when I force myself to talk, the other party gets bored. And hoardes of other problem.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I just want to get a few hormones checked, and wanting to know if results from labs like thyrocare, srl, lal path labs and  metropolis are reliable. Thyrocare is pretty cheap compared to others , but last time the  guy who came to collect my sample, didnt collect my urine sample. I had to ask him about that. Only then he gave me a vial to pee in.

I am trying to get a tatkal passport done urgently for my mom due to lack of time before travelling. My mom is a Karnataka Government school teacher and hence I am trying to get the Annexure H(prior intimation letter).

&amp;#x200B;

Whom should my mother address this to? Is it ok to get this addressed to the Headmaster of her school and get her sign and seal? Or does this have to go the BEO?

&amp;#x200B;

Going to the BEO involves a lot of horrible bureaucracy and we need to grease the palms of the clerk to the BEO.

Please let me know if it can be addressed to headmaster.

* Dual bandwidth is not necessary as there are not many wifi networks in the area so congestion isn't an issue. I rarely use the 5 Ghz on my current router.  
  

* Bonus points if it supports guest network features with speed limitations. I don't want users to have access to my LAN network just because I gave them my wifi password. So setting up a guest network could be nice.  
  

* The ACT box is located in my house itself. So i dont think I'll need a modem. A CAT cable comes directly from the box which I assume can be directly connected to the router. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Last year I made on post on this subreddit(https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8y7far/starting_college_at_25/). 
So yeah I took admission in IGNOU this year in January. Have filled couple of forms for SSC CHSE and going to fill form for RRB MUMBAI for railway posts.
For past 4 to 5 months I have been too depressed. I have been feeling so behind. Thinking about future is constantly giving me shakes every night. I constantly wake up at night due to my never ending thoughts. Can't seem to get back to sleep. 
I keep feeling ashamed of myself. I can't even maintain eye contacts with my parents. 
I basically have no friends since last 2 years. I feel isolated and cut of from world. Never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and the only women  I have ever casually talked with is my mother and my cousins.
Since past 4 to 5 months I have been so depressed that I have started chain-smoking. I lie to mother everyday that I'm going to meet friends while in reality I'm out smoking alone. I don't know if I even have a future. Watching all the young people getting jobs, having time of their life, having a relationship, makes me feel even more miserable.

I am also not in good shape. For most of my life I have been an underweight. At 25 I only weigh 56 kgs. I constantly feel depressed that not only I don't have a career but I also don't look good. Every night I am getting panic attacks. Feels like getting a heart attack.

I have an older brother. He passed engineering from an good govt college. Did MBA from IIM. Earns 1.6 lpm. And here I am his pathetic brother who is no good at anything. I feel so ashamed just looking at him. I don't even deserve to be called his brother.

When I made post last year, reading all the comments, I felt good for a while. Felt like I was going to get my life on track. But I feel scared now. Am losing my confidence. Even smallest task like talking to someone feels like dread is looming over me. 
Soon turning 26 in 2 months. Don't know what to do. Feel so drained and exhausted.

I have only recently started earning, and as with most Indians, I didn't previously have the luxury of traveling during my studies. What this means is, I'm a bit of a doof when it comes to knowing great places to travel/see in India. But during my masters abroad I made a few close friends and want to plan a trip to India with them. The idea is to show them how different life here is from the western world they're accustomed to. Also, a bit of fun and relaxation, of course. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering taking them to my Grandma's place in a village down south, maybe Andaman and Nicobar islands, Taj mahal because they might wanna see it, the Onam boat race, some amazing waterfalls, etc. It's a mixed group of 6 to 7 people. 

&amp;#x200B;

In that spirit, I'd like to invite all of you to suggest some amazing things that our country has to offer. Nothing's fixed yet, so all advice is welcome (even general travel advice). Who knows, this might spur some of you to pack your bags and hit the road too ;)

the app is not letting us transfer funds back to our banks or other wallets, its been like this since late December

their Costumer service never pick calls , if they do after 30mins on hold they say "" server problem try tomorrow""




#why its a  scam

#1 ::: false advertising and just trickery::::

when you download the app and deposit money into it , **they never mention that to withdraw your money back** you need to send them a physical hard copy of  a online application form to their main office in Mumbai by speed post. 

it is easier to just open a bank account in your area. **they do it intentionally** ,because most people wold rather loose their deposited  100 or 200  than going through weeks of paperwork and costumer care hazel . I only did it because i'm a gullible dumbass who deposited 5k on my first transaction.


#2::: their virtual card is fake and wont work:::

- most ppl download this app for this feature, only to find out every sites never take TMW virtual cards , unless your virtual card is verified by a reputed institute they will be rejected. TMW virtual cards are generic trash cards that you can get free on the net.

- it says master card on it, but it doesn't support international transactions. its a shit version of rupay, **this is clear false advertisement** because if you go their shopping section in the app its filled with westren ecommers brands like Ebay, dell, aliexpress  

- my friend spent a hundreds and got their physical cards, only to find out the ATM machines don't even recognize it


#3::: they have basically locked the users out from their money:::


**for nearly a month they haven't allowed its users transfer money back to their banks**, when you try to transfer it says ""issue with the server""  , yet you can still deposit money into it.

your only choice here is either wait forever where they probably slowly mooch of your  $ for maintenance or spend what money you have on their features like recharging or bill payment


#4::: lieing clueless morons in customer care:::

i was scammed from the day 1

- before i deposited my money(5k) ,i called the costumer care and asked them if i can use the debit card to buy shit from foreign gaming site, they lied . their cards are not accepted anywhere let alone gaming sites.

- after facing this problem i called again , now they tell me i need to activate my KYC to resolve this problem. nowhere did they warm me that this was basically a dummy account .

- after wasting a entire day(s) filling the application and waiting at the post office to send  this fucking package, i waited a week and called again, they now say to send it by speed post because my mail might be lost.

- after doing this shit again by speed post , it took 8days for my account to be officially approved, speed post to Mumbai from here can be sent in 24 hours, these slow ass mofos took a week

- no one picks up the calls , i have litrally spent 30-50 mins on hold, i have made it a trend to call them once a week .  i literally put it on speaker and do my work or drive or anything


#5::: shit app:::

most of the app is broken in general , you cant use most of their features



#any advice would be helpful

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tl;dr

TMW is ewallet , for over a month it's not letting people withdraw or transfer funds. Their customer service is non existent if they do respond they claim its a server problem

So now, today I again called the helpline to enquire about the status of my complaint and they said that the transaction did happen, but I never collected the cash.

By that logic, we all should become tour guides. I dont know on what basis people decide what to become..

I think turning passion into profession is a rich mans game. Not for me.

What I want is a life of fakeer, travel in trains all my life, reading about politics and administration and law of India. But thats a fantasy dream. How will I earn money while I travel in trains? I dont know coding or content writing.

The problem with capitalism is that it compels every person to compete in the name of survival of the fittest. Capitalism does not pay attention to those who would rather commit suicide instead of being a part of such artificial world, a world in which there is no contact with nature etc.

Market that is based on demand and supppy rather than need and supply. So if there is a demand from some foolish people who want to shell their money on things they dont need, then so be it!

Roman Saini took the exam as a joke and resigned when he realized there is more money in his project of Unacademy.


The same goes for position of MLA and MP.

So I was thinking of what if we do something to solve this. Ofcourse what I will write now is a utopia so no need to highlight it out.


The best thing I can think of is the concept of Swaraj Schools.

Under this there would be 4 levels of schools in India meant to raise philosopher kings.


1- MLA Swaraj School - One school in every MLA constituency. Total 20 students. 5 students in each class. 5 future MLA'S. 5 future SDM's. 5 future bonafide lawyers for the constituency. 5 future social workers who will educate every person on things that matter. 4 pillars. Legislature. Executive. Jusdiciary. The People.

Students will be admitted at an early age. Trained to grow up as fighters with knowledge and integrity. 

So these 5 future MLA's on becoming adults would ve given more importance in elections by people of India. 

We might have to do away with system of elections and civil service exam if we bring this.Although not necessary. Now if this idea makes you feel uncomfortable because it takes away equal opportunity, I think you really need to be sure that you have knowledge on what would be best for this country in end before you even start judging me and downvote this post based on your emotions rather than logic and reason.

2- MP Swaraj school - Would be similar on the lines of MLA Swaraj school.

3- State  swaraj school - This would be for training specialists who will work in the ministries. So no need for a scholar who cleared civils, becoming a DM and then becoming incharge of health ministry telling doctors what they should do even when he himself is totally clueless about the health and medicine sector. Major Gaurav Arya has written an Article on this problem in India. Japan is much better than us in this respect.

4- National Swaraj School - To  recruit kids who will work as specialists in future in a specific ministry and secretary, deputy secretary etc.",,adu94v,,0,,false,1552608611,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/adu94v/is_there_something_wrong_with_how_india_recruits/,,,false,AskIndia,

I tried scheduling my time but I can't do it alone.. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would anyone be kind enough to help me with my schedule?

&amp;#x200B;

I have only 3 things to do apart from my daily chores (bathing, brushing, etc.) :-

Study, anime/manga and drawing practice....

social media usage: \~ zero (I have neither facebook nor instagram... just a whatsapp account, which I open 2-3 times in a month)

outdoor activities: nil ( I don't venture out of my room, much less my house; unless the matter is way too urgent and/or unavoidable; have been reprimanded many times by family members for this)

&amp;#x200B;

wake up time: 5-6 (mostly 5 am.. then I feel way too drowsy and can't stay awake.. then when I reopen my eyes, it's already 8 ;-;)

&amp;#x200B;

sleeping time: 11-12 pm (depending on when I feel sleepy)

NO. I DO NOT USE MY PHONE WHEN I'M ABOUT TO GO TO SLEEP.. But, stress and anxiety prevents me from getting a good sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I have often found myself waking up at 3 am when I barely went to bed at 12 last night.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I'm trying to limit my daily activities but sometimes, it just overshoots the 1 hour limit.. would also like some tips on how to have a good and clean bath, have a good teeth brush, etc, in an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a relatively old construction. The location is in one of the prime areas of the city. However, even being a residential building, this place is being rented out by our landlord for commercial use. That is causing a lot of damage to the structure.

&amp;#x200B;

There is no unity within the tenants and all they do is baseless meetings leading nowhere and achieving nothing at the end of the day. The landlord is rich and gives zero fuck about this property. He is also in dispute with his siblings over the ownership of the property which is stopping the redevelopment.

&amp;#x200B;

We are facing a lot of issues due to commercial use and structure being very old, we fear it might collapse some day. The electrical wiring is a mess and can any day bust in to a wildfire due to short circuit. Landlord is a very rude and arrogant person and has some contacts at hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anyway I can bring this to local authority's and media's attention for quick and impacting action? I live in Mumbai if that affects this in anyway.

3. Stock Android. This one is pretty obvious but I also prefer stock as such devices are easier to root and have more custom ROM support as compared to other devices.


Suggestions are welcome, but I'd prefer not to buy Xiaomi due to previous poor experiences regarding Cell reception. 

My budget is 20k as mentioned in the title, but can be stretched upto 23-24k. Thank you.

Sorry if this isn't allowed but a friend of mine is interested in the Vagriboli and Kuravar.

Apparently she found that someone made contact with the Vagriboli in an effort to make a written record of their language but we're not able to find any books on it. From what I understand they're from the Tamil region and were studied in the 70s by Dr. Siromoney.

Does anyone have any leads or knowledge on this? It'd be a great help. My friend is trying to learn Tamil so even if the book isn't in English, I'd still love any feedback.

My question is what should be the 'format' of that invitation letter? I see there are some example formats online which I can use &amp; change the text as per my case.

And I want to hear stories of people who’ve been successful w/o BTech, MBBS, or LLB. 

Hey everyone 

I’m going to be giving JEE, BITSAT, CET, etc but I’m not particularly interested in engineering. Physics and Chemistry make me cry. I’m going to be honest, I hate the idea of engineering. I have known since I started high school that I do not want to pursue engineering. I wanted to study commerce after 10th because I’m genuinely interested in economics, accounting, bst and those subjects. 

I was interested in becoming an actuary. Lots of people recommend PCM at the +2 level to strengthen my base in mathematics. I was still against it. After a lot of crying and trying to persuade my parents, I still had to take science. Fine it wasn’t their fault, many Bsc degrees did require PCM and they did for me. 

Now almost done with 12th boards, which I’ll probably get ~87 percent in because I genuinely hate physics and chemistry. And I have a lot of pressure to give JEE and many engineering entrances. Parents talked to colleagues and many of them said if she’s smart, why does she want to get a BSc? Recommended CSE or MnC at IITs. So now, I have to give those stupid entrances. 

After all of that, there’s doubt in my head about other degrees. BTech degrees seem like the only possible option if I want to make big bucks. I feel like if I don’t get a BTech, that’s it I’m done. No good career. 

So basically, after 10th I wanted to study commerce but couldn’t. Agreed to study PCM for Bsc in stats. Now I have to do engineering. I’m not studying anything that I want. Just because I get good grades in PCM does not mean it’s doesn’t make me want to rip my hair out, because it really does. 

The point of this post is, I want to hear success stories of people who haven’t done MBBS, BTech, or LLM/LLB. I want to be convinced that not studying engineering is not the end of the world. I feel really bad about my future now. So if anyone could help me out, I would really appreciate it.

What my app would do?

1. My app would make them visible within a certain radius (say 5 km) 
2. Would allow customers to search such businesses by product. 
3. Provide a WhatsApp like chat-interface where the customers can communicate with them and know about their products (queries like price, availability, quantity). This would also help in customer retention.

1546450967,india,[deleted],self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/abvm5a/need_some_advice_about_campus_placement_and_job/,4,9,,,Need some advice about campus placement and job,"VERY LONG POST


So I'm a final year student at a one of the best private unis in India. This is the placement season and will be till April or May. I failed in most of the company exams and sometimes couldn't even clear the first round because there were coding rounds and all that crap. Anyhow I did manage to reach 3 interviews but somehow fucked up there too. My resume totally sucked ass, some lame ass skills and had done that shitty ass industrial training.If I had got job in the mass recruiters, I wouldn't be satisfied. Most of my friends got placed in them. I've heard some stories or interviews and how the students did nothing and some even showed their musically profile when asked about interests. I have no problem with that.

The thing is these companies are asking c,c++,ds,dbms,os and all that stuff and tbh how much I have tried to practice those I just don't have any interest in learning them no matter what anybody says. My goal is primarily to be a front end developer and maybe full stack someday ( I know there's coding and database involved here but I'm developing an interest here unlike the subjects I had failed to learn in the past 4 years or so) and I'm working on it, it'll probably take some months to build a good resume. I have to apply off campus probably ?

It feels like I'm just exaggerating over this stuff but really it's been bugging me for this past week. I've been doing nothing for the last two days and just listening to songs all day and daydreaming. December was off due to holidays and at home. I don't know what I'm doing tbh, feeling like a depressed person. It makes me more depressed when mom says ghar pe mat bethna bas. I don't know, I sit in front of my computer all day and I'm dependent on the Internet. I always wonder why people from CS background join coaching classes when there's so much stuff here online and you can buy courses for cheap than paying big bucks on coaching. (PS: I have coaching phobia now due to depressive experiences after high school ) 

Sales companies have been coming for quite some time (and I'm a huge Office fan lol) I don't know, should it be a good choice to join sales ? I wanna know what kind of work they have. Some friends got placed in sales for 5-6 lpa package. Impressive. How does it feel to work in sales for a CS student ?

I'm giving a last shot for placement. I'll probably mug basics of DS,C++ and DBMS tho I hate it so much. Am I being too harsh, ignorant and disrespectful to the opportunities ? I don't know. Some job is better than no job, right? I don't know man. I am also learning web dev related stuff side by side, though slowly for some days now.

Moreover, I have no family pressure. Parents are supportive and in a good financial condition. Two members of my family are working. My dad has quite an experience, he's working since 21 and around 55 now. I'm thankful to my family for what they have done for me. I'm not being forced upon like I have to take care of family. But deep inside I've got a point to prove by getting a job

My goals are to travel all over India on my money and produce music and learn new things.It'll be a relief when I get a job cuz for now I'm just holding back everything. Marriage is my least concern. I'm not against marriage but why have kids when you're not able to take proper care and provide them. I feel sad for the people who have to sacrifice their dreams even when they have the opportunity to make it big. 


Ok so, if nothing works out, will go for govt or bank jobs. They are respectable, according to my parents. 

Has anyone faced similar dilemma or you know something job related ?



tl;dr: Guy in final year not able to make career choice. Need some advice.

Ltd.?,"Two friends of mine (College Students; lets call them A&amp;B) are taking training from DBA (kota). One of them (A) had a facebook friend and she told him about this *WONDERFUL* opportunity to earn thousands in no time, after giving some thoughts they decided to go through the training and see if the JOB is good or not. B called me on the second day of training and told me that they are gaining many new skills and knowledge and the platform is so big that anyone can earn thousands based on their knowledge and dedication.  I had known about the MLM scam from last month (someone posted about QNet on this subreddit), so i asked him (B) and found out that job was related to marketing. I googled about the company and found out many people have been scammed by the same company (youtube, blogs, consumercompaints , i know all these sources are not reliable). I called my friend (B), and explained everything to him that how they (The trainers) manipulate and brainwash others and what kind of work they are going to do and how much money they will earn, and my friend (B) told me that he had the same feeling that it might be a scam (A guy, who first welcomed him to the training center was now glued to him and would not leave him alone for even a minute. He would wake him up in the morning, will have lunch/dinner with him, and pretty much everything). So he (B) watched the videos and blogs that i sent him and he told me that these exact things are happening to him.

Now, about the other guy (A), one who was approached by the DBA girl on facebook has been completely brain washed that he is not even trying to understand the situation, my friend (B) has tried many times but failed to make the other guy (A) understand (and the glued guy is making it even more hard). Today is the last day for registration (A has *passed* the final *interview*), and the company is telling him to pay 8k now and to purchase 45k worth of products (clothes) from their company after few days. We (me and the other guy- B) have tried to stop him from registering but failed.

53000 rs. is a big amount for that guy (A) and he is desperate to get a job. Now he has started to get angry and has told us to mind our own business .We can not press him any further. 

Any idea how to convince him or how to deal with this situation?

Thanks in advance.

Sorry for bad english.

Any other institutions which I should take care of? As of right now will apply at various locations accordingly. Please help.

I know my condition is not that bad , but I am a bit lost in what to do.

Thank you.

.

I completed my Masters in Technology from a respectable NIT in Electronics Field, got a Job in an IT MNC, the pay was average, but it was still a nice thing.

My passion has always been writing, I've written 6 novels, a lot of poems and songs, then my interest got into script writing, I even wrote an 8 episode script for a Web/TV Series, my plan was to work in my IT job, and spend the free time on books and stories, try to develop them, and the day I start earning from writing, I'll leave my job.

But then a few months back, my mother had an operation, she's fine now, but still someone needs to be home to take care of her, my mother can walk and work, but no heavy lifting, or constant work, until this time, my sisters were there to take care of her, but eventually they had to go, as they are married, so I left my Job after training period, so that I don't have to break any bonds, and came back home.

I help her in daily chores, like cleaning, washing, cooking etc, and spend the day at home, so I thought of learning new things in this time.

.

Now I have a few questions and I need advice on them:

 1. Is there any way I can do something on internet and earn some money, I can write stories, articles, etc, I can even code, I can learn anything quickly, I'm good at it.

 2. I'm also looking for Jobs here, but Surat doesn't have IT Industries, all the jobs are less paying, more working, if I can't find anything, last option is to become a teacher. I think God has given me a chance to rethink my career, so I'll take risks.

 3. Anyone got idea how to make a career out of writing, my ultimate dream is to publish a book at national level, and a Netflix/Amazon series or a movie written by me or based on my book.

 4. I know you have to start small, I'm ready to work, even for writing in magazines, online articles, Local Media Productions, scripts for short YouTube films or YouTube videos, I find it refreshing to work on something creative, can anyone help me how to get into it, it would be really helpful.

 5. I started learning WordPress today, because I saw a few jobs related to that in my city, the thing is I don't want to go out, I love my city, got my family here, I don't want to live it for IT jobs, if I leave, it should be for a creative job.

I hope all you people read this and give me valuable advice, feel free to ask anything, and help a brother out.",,b3a914,,0,,false,1560237782,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b3a914/i_want_some_career_and_future_advice/,,,false,AskIndia,

Scholarship doesn't cover failed courses that I'll have to retake. I'm studying here on just that + a modest education loan from India, mother is a student herself and doesn't hold a job. 

I'm close to having to come back to India without my degree if my financial constraints keep up.

I already have a job on campus but that pays for rent and food. 

Im getting my mother to pool in resources from our extended network via GoFundMe, but not sure how successful I am going to be, given the sensitive nature of my case I can't share it more publicly on social media and would have to rely on word of mouth and private links. 

Resources online for scholarships/resources to apply to during times like this for Indians abroad are scarce to none.

It is treadmill because you can't get to projects that you desire because the other side is waiting for immediate joining. Most of the companies refuse to even take application or conduct interviews just by seeing the notice period of 3 months. There are no laws to make it negotiable. It all started in March, 2016 when Service companies like TCS started mandatory to serve 3 months before leaving the job, now almost all companies follow the same trend. It is like endless torture and insufferable for me. 

It is almost one fourth of year - how to deal with these?

Can't be there be law to regulate this and make it to short say 1 - 2 weeks or no notice period at all?  I see there was one act (A 30 to 90-day notice period applies in order to terminate 'workmen' (as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947)), but it needs to change in current modern time.

There were petitions in past as well (e.g. [https://www.change.org/p/ministry-of-labour-and-employment-to-stop-indian-it-companies-from-forcefully-holding-employees-with-3-months-notice-period](https://www.change.org/p/ministry-of-labour-and-employment-to-stop-indian-it-companies-from-forcefully-holding-employees-with-3-months-notice-period)) but it doesn't have any effect.

What's my tax liability?","So I called my accountant today to ask whether 44ADA would be used when filing my tax returns this year, because we used it in 2017. Since my income was (and is) over the 2,50,000 limit but under the 5,00,000 limit, I did not have to pay any taxes. However, I did not file a tax return in 2018 as my income was waaaay under the limit.  I've read that you can't use 44ADA if you don't use it once (e.g. you used it in 2004 but didn't use it in 2005, so you can't use it in 2006) but I'm not sure if this means using some other IT form instead of ITR4S/44ADA OR not filing a return at all. Which is what I asked my accountant. All she says is I don't know. 

My mum and I are the only directors in an LLP (not really doing anything though - revenue is what, like, 30k and expenses are the same) and file everything that is necessary for it. Mum has retired and only has FD income. Now, me and mum had not included the LLP's income and expenses or its name in our previous IT returns for 2017 and 2018 (the LLP was incorporated in early 2017); this was done on the accountant's recommendation as she said there was no need to do that.  There was NO income at all in 2017 for the LLP, just expenses. 

My income this year is 4,52,000, and it is essential that I use 44ADA so I don't have to pay tax as I've already paid 7500 as professional taxes for NOTHING for my LLP, mum, and me..for LITERALLY NOTHING. We don't draw an income from the LLP, and her monthly income is only from bank FDs, not from a salary or wage. Paid that money for literally ZERO relevant income, just because. 

My accountant refused to comment on what my personal tax liability could be or whether we would even use this (44ADA) again...despite already having paid her for the LLP and a part of the fees for our IT returns! She says she has to process everything, which I understand, but like, what am I paying an accountant for then if you can't even give me an answer? 

Damn it, I just want to know what my tax liability will be. We have no investments or anything of the sort so I really don't see why she can't give me a straight answer as I know that if you have capital gains, 44ADA cannot be used. I'm considering changing accountants but I've already paid her a good part of the fees.

This guy was almost fapping to his network marketing  Guru aka Sirji aka Bhagwaan. He said he can fix my meeting with Sirji if I want to make money through network marketing as well.

Today I met this Sirji in a hotel dining room face to face. It was empty except 2-3 people doing their own talk by our side. He was a good looking 25 year old man who behaved like a calm, smooth and sly businessman during our one hour meet. Good family of working people he had. But the fact that he had good income working parents, mamaji and grandparents was the problem itself.

He told me ideal life is one in which you make money without working. He told that network marketing is the solution for this.

For network marketing,
He told that Companies do not enjoy spending their money on useless advertisements. Slice does not love giving its money to Katrina. Appy does not love giving money to Saif. GoDaddy does not love giving its money to Dhoni. These companies dont love giving money to wholesalers, retailers blah blah.

He said Network Marketing is the solution to the problems of these companies. With my network marketing company, I would market the company products to people through social media etc, get new people connected and a chain of commissions would begin. I don't remember exact things he said.


He said I would need to invest Rs 1.5 lakh for this business. I felt it was scam and rejected. 

Can someone tell me what is it.


I feel like the concept is like Bitcoins of advertising world. It is good and a futuristic concept, but just like Bitcoins, people are taking it as a joke to make quick profit.

Battering rape: where there is both physical and sexual violence, usually there is evidence in the form of physical injuries.

Obsessive rape : where the aggressor, in addition to sexual violence also performs perverse sexual acts, usually there are injuries around or in the private parts

Force only rape : this is probably the most common, where the aggressor uses enough force to restrain the victim to allow sexual intercourse to occur. There are no injuries or marks of violence. This is usually the case when there is a huge strength difference between both. Also this is the hardest to prove.

But my parents find the situation unusual. 

Just for context, we're located in Delhi and come from I guess an upper class background. My 19 year old sister has always had many class friends and still does, but since starting college she became less close with them as she dislike parties and what not, and now speaks to them in class, but does not like to see them outside of class. For example, 2 weeks back she was invited and went to one classmates birthday party, but came home early because she said everyone was drinking and she didn't want to. Her class friends wanted her to come with them to Singapore for a school holiday shopping trip as well, but she was not interested in that either.

She now seems to have joined the friends circle of our maid, who is 20 years old and came to Delhi from Madhya Pradesh at age 18. All the others in this circle are also maids. When she sees them she wears a salwaar kameez to fit in with them, instead of the western clothes (shirt, jeans) she normally wears to class or when going out with family. She also now learned to speak Nimadi language which is the mother tongue of these maids. She seems to just tag along with them on the weekends (roaming bazaars, even going to the ration shop). They also cook together at home a lot, though the maid absolutely refuses to let her help with cleaning work.

Once again I'm not against it at all, I just was curious to see if anyone knows of a similar occurrence. My parents initially found this concerning, because they thought the maid might be manipulating her for money. But after a year of friendship this does not seem to be the case.",,awwyor,,0,,false,1560123444,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/awwyor/my_teenage_sister_is_now_close_friends_with_our/,,,false,AskIndia,

It occurred to me last night that we have a growing scene of youtubers in India and I kinda follow quite a few of them. But none of them actually have the content of random facts, science info that I usually watch on the English channel. For example, I know shit-ton about the Great Pyramid of Giza and a few facts that  I think are not really well known and it would be a good idea to introduce our new hindi-speaking people to the random facts to help them understand how to waste their lives too.

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't know is, how do I create these videos. For example, if you look at this video -&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko-ZboCzR64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko-ZboCzR64) , its fucking fantastic. I am an IT guy myself but I have never worked outside of a Linux terminal. I am guessing I need to learn ""Adobe premier pro"" here?

The question is, what tools do I need to learn?

Look at that youtube video that I linked, I would like to be able to create something like that.

Currently giving boards and am faced with 2 choices. 
#1 ENGINEERING: I could get into a 2nd tier engineering college. The problem is that I don't enjoy engineering and am also pretty shit at science in general. 
Tbh when I look back I have not performed well in even ONE of those coaching exams. 
It's like the frequency didn't match from DAY ONE and I expect to be on this similar trajectory if I pursue btech. 

#2 BMM: My parents have shrugged this off for now. They think that I want to pursue bmm because I am lazy and don't want to work. 
But is that wrong.. 
For me doing something creative and interacting with people to make a final end product seem Heaven and seems fucking fun.
The problem is that my dad thinks this degree is worse than b. Com and only for people who don't want to study. And tbh I don't blame him for not being informed but I want to take a decision not out of desperation but objectively. 

So reddit what should I do? 

TL:DR: below average engineering coaching student wants to study B. M. M. (Bachelors of mass media). 
Give him a reality check.

But this time, both the new application and the old application from 2014 came through and now I have two voter IDs by the same name and the same address.

A couple of months back, the ECI undertook door to door services for enrollment into the voter list and I told the representative about this. She found both the IDs from the list and asked me to choose one and the other will be deleted.

I just checked again today and both my IDs still exist.

Is having two voter IDs illegal and punishable? Or is it an offence only when it's from two different places? What should I do?

Now, I'm a complete ardent believer in the fact that in terms of temperament, personality etc. the people from South Asia are more or less the same. You won't find much of a difference between Pakistani Punjabis and Indian Punjabis and so worth.

So I wonder, \*why\* is there such a difference in the way that you see Indian and Pakistani news anchors conduct themselves on television? As an example for reference, I believe a good place for Indians to get a point of reference to the Pakistani media reaction would be the APS attacks. There was grief and melancholy, but nobody was explicitly ""angry"" and suggesting how the army should go about nuking the Taliban hideouts.

Assuming you guys agree there's a difference, what would explain is?Is it because Indian media is more reliant on sensationalism to function as entities? (Compare Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares in the UK compared to the US version)

Or is it something else?I commonly see Indians calling out the education of their TV anchors, which I find interesting because from the Pakistani side of things, our anchors are normally from a relatively well-read section of society?

Chime your thoughts in. Cheers from across the border.

I enjoy photography. A lot. I've been clicking photos with my kit lens for the last 5-6 years, and I've known that I am outgrowing it each day, and I know that I am going to buy a new lens. Thing is, I work as an architect, and I get paid (enough for a fresh graduate), and I can buy a lens whenever I want - no one is stopping me. But somewhere at the back of my head, before spending money, there is a voice that is constantly asking me, ""Why do you want to spend money? Save it! Don't!"" But then another voice comes and says, ""If you are not gonna buy it now, you'll probably never buy it."" Most of the time, the first voice is of my parents (and no I am not saying that my parents are bad or anything).  


My question is - has psychological conditioning from our parents/ourselves changed us so bad - that we feel guilty about buying something for ourselves? I mean, I know its not wrong to buy anything for ourselves, but why do I feel guilty about it? I I bought a hard disk and a pen tablet (because I use it as a portfolio thing), and I felt the same thing - but this is another whole ball game.   


Anyone else feels like this? Before buying anything, do you feel your parents looking over your shoulder judging you, almost you asking yourself, ""Why do you want to buy it?"" with a hint of disgust?

Not that I will blindly follow one's advice but it will help me to take good decision.

I'm from middle class who is an introvert, well groomed, fit and active. Having varied interests and hobbies keeps me occupied esp., travelling, trekking and photography. Working in a small IT startup I earn enough to live a comfortable life.

My parents have been trying to get me married for the past 3 years. Coming from a small city, my family is moderately conservative. They definitely want a bride in same caste and matching horroscope. Most preferably in same city so that they can know well about bride's family background. We are signed up in matrimonial sites also. The selection process is usually this: my parents check for kundli match and girl's family, out of which I choose one that's looking good, then if both families agree do we have a meeting in a temple. That's when I look for matching personality.

Parents are dissatisfied and already tired of me as I'm picky. They expect me to choose the one just with good family and kundli match. They don't care about personality and the appearance. Met couple of potential bride vis a vis with family in a temple who were good looking but are boring ""family girls"" who doesn't have passion for anything nor did they show interest in what I do. So we didn't proceed.

Recently I met similar one. We talked for 15 mins. It was me talking most of the time. She asked about my job, do I own car, can I cook. I try to understand her from her daily activities. She was like home-to-work, work-to-home in weekdays and may visit malls in the weekends if not visiting hometown. There wasn't much of similarities other than both of us are in software industry. Her realtive was rushing to end this talk and she didn't have anything to talk. Their family and girl instantly showed their interest to proceed. I held my parents, who were also interested, and said we'll go home and reply.

It was difficult for me to decide life partner within few minutes. I want to know many other things including whether she can keep herself healthy and fit in the future, whether she is interested to accompany me for weekend trips, etc. Made my parents to call them and ask for a casual meeting in a public place. They refused and will allow further talks only if I say yes. Pretty conservative and probably they fear I might reject after the talk and it'll be a shame for them.

I'm gonna hit 30 soon. It's considered past marriageable age by many. So, fewer opportunities. Also skewed sex ratio! I'm confused shall I settle for this (like [Bojack says](https://youtu.be/cTAi_3HWKHQ) ) or take risk and look out further. I appreciate your advice.

_EDIT:_ To provide better context, I don't have much of social circle. There are few male friends with whom I hangout occasionally and travel. They also don't have girlfriends. Actually they don't care about it. My introversion wasn't helpful to find a life partner.
I have had couple of relationships in the past whom I met through dating apps. They lasted few months to a year. If it were strong, I would be determined to marry irrespective of parents' approval.

I have observed a number of older men who are uncomfortable working with women especially when the woman is demanding and doesn't act like a subordinate. 

Sometimes, it is overt. I have had a PSU bank GM once ask me informally how I manage to work under a woman (my manager for the project was a woman). On most occasions, however, it is covert. In a stint at a factory, during our weekly meetings (which used to be pretty fiery), the rest of us got to argue with the clients, but, whenever my female colleague spoke, she was shut down by the plant manager (although they used to be very respectful of her and call her ""madam"" all the time) pretty quickly.

In my current assignment, my female subordinate told me that our key client never looks at her when he talks to her. I observed that it was true and very odd - whereas he is completely normal when he is speaking to any guy. He hardly ever spoke to her and always interacted with me even on topics she was working on. Initially, I attributed it to the fact that he is a senior person and probably doesn't want to talk to the junior-most member of the team. So, I encouraged her to directly call him and present her own topics in meetings. However, he just doesn't take calls from her. This one time there was an error in her output, but, that was purely because his subordinate had supplied us erroneous data. So, he called her and shouted at her and hung up even before she could speak. When she told me about it, I verified her work and found the error in the data provided to us (which could have not been cross-checked as well) . So, I asked her to shoot him a mail showing the error. 

I also called him up and he was very nice to me and apologized for sending the wrong data. But, he never apologized to my subordinate.

Ad Description: A woman orders a sprite or 7 up to her room. Then she is in a bathroom wearing a bathrobe. Meanwhile, a butler/room service delivers the drink to her.  She then strips and steps into the bathtub. Following which she looks into the camera and says in Hindi, ""Kisi ko ander ane mat dena"" (don't let anyone in). She then bathes and douses herself with the contents of the drink which was in a green bottle. Then a man in a suit is seen to walk into the bathroom. Then the ad ends. 

Location: I saw this ad when I was in Mumbai. 

Why: This ad significantly influenced my sex life, and my obsession for having sex in the bathtub and shower. I watched it when I was 7-8 and I still think about it. I would appreciate it if someone else here can recall this ad or at least remember what company the ad was from.

Edit 2 : You guys are welcome to share your story too, I would love to hear it :-)

&amp;#x200B;

I want to share my story regarding Astrology and these other things Indians (most of us) believe in. When I  was a kid with little brain, my Mom used to tell me how priests are superior than us and whatever they say is right. I used to believe that if I don't do what priest say, something bad will happen to me. People will start taking me as a negative person, I will be proved wrong even when I'm right and things will not just go right for me. The most chilling part for me was even after working hard I will not be able to get what I deserve so due to the power of self doubt and illusion I had to believe all the crap everyone (elders) threw at me. But, after the internet came, after I saw what is going in the developed countries and how these guys don't even give half a damn about these things, I thought either Indians are doomed to be unlucky if they don't do things the "" priest way "" or there is no such thing as Astrology ( and the intensity with which we believe all of these things that are sometimes sugarcoated under religion) or so and old generation is just passing this thing to the new generations. What are your honest thoughts and experience related to these things.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the second part of the story and gets a little interesting. I am about to marry a girl but unfortunately my mom is able to know better about her astrological stuff so she went to the "" pandit "" who then says that girl is "" mangalik "", I'm sorry I don't know the English word for it. Before I could even comprehend what to say, she started saying all the unlucky, bad and stupid things that happened to guys / girls when they married a mismatched kundli / astrological profile. I just get sick of the thought that how can some completely outside factor not only control us but is able to ruin our marriage and the priests are able to foretell that. If they can really use their knowledge to determine future, how the hell they are not millionaires speculating on stock?? What they say is always so general, and not specific at all.

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys are wondering what superstitious / astrological things I'm talking about, here's a list:

1. Putting milk on Shivling
2. Not eating chicken  / eggs on Tuesday
3. Doing Pooja if stars are bad
4. Wearing a ring if stars are bad
5. Giving groceries to priest on auspicious days
6. Not marrying if Kundli don't match, your fiance, her personality, likes, dislikes, common hobbies, temperament doesn't matter at all so as long as kundlis match all of the other things will match automatically through the power of god
7. Shani Satvi in which you're supposed to suffer for 7 years. Where ever that came from, it's just so mean to say things like that to someone especially if he or she believes in astrology, this can break that person emotionally.
8. Don't swipe the floor in the evening, black kitty is bad for you ( racist ) , don't shake your fucking legs or you'll lose money, cow shit is good for you brings luck, number 8 is not. Apparently, 101re can make someone really lucky than 100re ( actually they'll be richer than a whole ruppee so I believe in this ! lmao). How evil eye is bad, and putting some kajol will help fight the evil eye.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr:

1. I posted this on r/pakistan last night, I think r/india might also be a good place to hear opinions
2. The tl;dr is at the bottom in bold

So I'm eighteen and a senior in American high school. I lived in Pakistan until I was seven, and I didn't even realize until after I left, that India and Pakistan had/have bad relations.

But anyway my school is mostly made up of white, black, and hispanic people, however I always noticed this one girl who was Indian, and I didn't notice her because we're the same race, but because she's loud as hell. All the other South Asian kids at our school are quiet and reserved.

Today I got switched into a culinary class, and that Indian girl was sitting inside the classroom. She's not apart of the class, she just sits in there because that's her lunch period and the teacher likes her, I guess.

Since she's not in the class I asked her to watch my phone, and after I finished my work I sat near her to get to know her since I thought we could relate to each other, because like I said South Asian kids are rare in my school. Plus, we're the same grade and we're both girls.

We got along well and I guess she assumed I was from India too, because at one point she said

""You're like, the only other Indian bitch at this school who has a personality.""

I laughed and told her I was actually from Pakistan. She said ""Oh"" and stopped talking to me all of a sudden.

I saw her at the end of the day and tried to say hi to her, but she shrugged me off very hastily so I don't think we're friends anymore, not that I really care.

I don't get it. We were getting along fine, but as soon as she found out I was Pakistani and not Indian she got angry at me, as if I can control where I was born.

I guess she's just really in touch with her Indian intolerance. She said a lot of judgy things about gays and muslims, too, which is odd for an eighteen-year-old Americanized chick to rant about.

I don't think she would have made a good friend anyways.

**tl;dr I go to an American high school, but I'm from Pakistan. I tried to befriend this girl from India today at school, but as soon I told her I was Pakistani and not Indian, she became very mean to me, so I don't think we're friends anymore.**

I was approached by a married guy in his 40s. I made my no clear to him in the beginning itself. But then he went on to crib about his difficult childhood and claimed to love me more than he ever loved his wife. Evoked symapthies from me and I agreed to be in a relation. 

I'm ashamed of writing what follows. He used me to fulfill his sexual fantasies like having sex in balcony while his parents were inside, and in an old archaic building's filthy common toilet. He literally forced me. I remember him grabbing me by collar to drag me playfully in the first case. I feel so used and violated. He even wanted to have sex in public urinals, at which  when I got mad he started saying that I have temper issues. Apart from that, he kept gaslighting me for more than 6 months by calling my observation of his reduced interest in me as voices in my head. 

He clearly manipulated and used and dumped me. No need to tell he was reminded of his dear wife after infatuation was over.   

Can I take any legal action against him? I have solid proofs of our relationship in the form of chats, video call screenshots, pictures, even nudes. I just can't prove the fake promises he made to me to trick me. I can trap him in rhetoric because I know I've truth. 

Please tell me at least I can fucking break his face.

So I can't take legal route. Sharing his nudes, our chats, his fake promises with his affiliates is cool? Hitting him is okay?

If there is a very intelligent kid in 3rd grade who finishes the syllabus of 5th grade via digital lessons due to his high IQ and interest, what is the need of forcing him to attend classes and lectures in schools and colleges so that he has to listen to the lectures of a teacher that tells things that he has already learnt? Isn't that a waste of time? He can utilize such time to learn something new instead. What is the need of enforcing minimum attendence on such kid? Why don't we create an education system where the knowledge and integrity of a kid is tested after every 6 months which he has to pass. After that, there would be no need for him to attend any lessons and he can gain new knowledge and skills according to his own comfort.

If this is the essence of homeschooling, then what is wrong in it? Why does not state establish knowledge centres in every city where the student learns things at his own pace via structures lessons on a computer/laptop?

Edit 1 : So I think that homeschooling is not a good idea. The problem can be solved by two provisions in education system. 

First, studying through digital lessons in separate computer labs for kids who feel they do not belong to the culture and IQ of their classmates.We shall never force such kids to change their pace and method of study just for the sake of socialising.

People with high IQs will crack it, while average folk will be crushed.","I am talking about CAT,GRE and bank exams. All these exams contain maths,puzzles and logical reasoning. All the toppers who score 99 percentile have high IQs. People say IQ doesn't matter, but it does. Look at people who go to IIM, top level colleges and toppers. Most of them have educated parents. Intelligent people. There maybe few exceptions that a poor guy does it, bit it's due to IQ. Most of my friends and me myself studied for all these exams and were slaughtered. How the hell you can learn pattern recognition, solving puzzles and logical reasoning it's instrinic. I gave my first mock and scored 40 percentile. While my brother who is in 8 STD he was tested with an IQ of 134 scored 96 percentile without preparation. I have seen lot of people who study for months but still end up scoring less, while some people who go without preparing and still scored 99 percentiles! 
I am not ranting, but I think it's unfair to average guys like me. 
If I was born to intelligent parents and inherited their intelligence (above 130 IQ), I would have made my dreams come true. Toppers are biggest liers ever, (no hate agianst them). They always say hardwork becuase they want to empathize with average students, but they also know it's mostly due to their IQ they are toppers. They know they process info faster, connect the information processed and make conclusion based on it. 
Look at IITans, toppers would definitely have an IQ above 160. I always see IITans parents are intelligent and successful. See why genetics predisposition matters. All the people who also made contributions had these common factors 
1. High IQ
2. Smart parents and luck
3. Right place at right time 
You maybe pe pissed how the post went from this to this, but I can't hold on my frustration. I am tired of being below average. I would be prefer to be dead, than average. I am not hating anyone. But, some people are just born to be winners and some losers. Genetics are important, no wonder women subconsciously choose man who is successful. Not all,but few.
So why to chooses to live? I am not implying suicide, but it's unfair and boring. Why to be just average? 
Look at bill gates
1. Born to successful parents, father was prominent lawyer and mother was an entrepreneur.
2. Scored 1590 on SAT which is equal to an IQ of 151.
3. Was at right place at right time. 
I am not hating, but just saying how some people are destined to be billionaires?

I don't want to live anymore.,"I am turning 22 next month. First and foremost, I fucked up my Engineering (cs) real bad. My CGPA is somehow decent around 6.5 and I feel really bad about it because I could've done better if I had paid attention to the exams. I was not able to secure a job from college even in mass recruitment companies like TCS. Most of my friends with whom I had spent my whole four years now have good jobs and I wonder what kind of a failure I had been. I know I should look for a job now but somehow my morale has been down ever since. I have lost interest in everything, don't even smile anymore. Friends keep posting pictures of themselves enjoying and hanging around in bars and pubs and here I am thinking what went wrong. It was all my mistake. There's no one to blame but me. Adding to all that. my girlfriend left me 4 months ago saying why you got to be so depressed. I understand but I couldn't give her more of my time like other guys give. Nothing seems to be in postion right now, my mood suddenly changes like a wind. Loneliness made me somewhat closer to spirituality for there's nothing wrong to enjoy your own company. I used to smoke a lot of dank ganja during college days with my buddies endlessly but now I smoke to get some perspective on life. I also tripped on shrooms and that trip made me aware of how hollow your life is.


Right now, I don't feel like moving out of my bed. I live with my parents with all the comfort and amenities. It's surprising they haven't disowned me yet. You may tell me to shut the fuck up and work hard but I'm living a delusional life without thinking about the future. Should I live in the present ? I don't think so.

My father(eldest) and his brother were born and raised in the ancestral house in Tamil Nadu(Trichy ) and my father migrated to Delhi for his job when he turned 24 in late 1980's. His brother stayed in the same house along with his wife and kid. Since my father was posted this far away, he used to visit his house one in a year, and after his marriage it got reduced to once in two or three years.(late 90's) 

My grandfather did not write any will about the  house and after his death (2000)my father's brother got the house transferred to his name with help of his  lawyers in the year 2001 without informing my father. We are in the process of getting the documents which enabled the transfer of house by the registration office in Trichy.

My father now(2019) retired wanted to permanently move to this home without the knowledge of this cheating done by his brother. He was denied an entry and was asked by his brother to not come to the house as it is his house now. He was humiliated when he seeked help of friends and relatives. My father was heartbroken and did not persue to go by the legal route to get the entry to the house. Whereas I am very much distressed by the way his brother cheated my father and want to how to proceed to solve the matter.Some of the opinions which I got was

1. File a legal case and get the our part of the house. I insisted my father to take this route but he said that he wants peace of mind and don't want to fight it out. (Also his brother's kid is about to get married in coming months).
2. File a criminal case as it was told that it is an ancestral property and what he has done is illegal. I am not sure about the the house being ancestral  as there are records of occupation  up to my grandfather- 3 generations(need to be four generations old). Get the our part of the house and sell it off (quite a good income from sale of the part around upwards of  50 lakhs)

I am very sure that I want to persue the second option but it's getting difficult to convince my dad to agree to it as he says the amount of effort we will put into this will not be worth it. 

Guys what are your opinion on this? How much of the effort will realistically be involved along with the lawyers and court hearings?

I have very good friends from India. I graduated from reputed Indian university and India is still my top destination to travel in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

I have travelled around the world. I have been to 5 continents, and nonetheless India is my favourite place to visit. The extremes are quiet profound in India. Like, sometimes you meet someone with some deep philosophical or technological understanding and sometimes you meet someone who fucks you up as you would not even dare to do it to your own enemy. There are good and bad in every cultural. We still have to appreciate that India is a very peaceful country. In other part of the world where they have extreme class difference like in India are much more violent and crime rates are much higher, where as in India there is no violence, which I really love.

&amp;#x200B;

My question: why fraud mentality is it so prevalent in India? Even in general day to day life, making someone a chutiya is taken as fun and more people you make fool of or take advantage of; you are taken as a ""smart"" person. This phenomenon has its root into Indian sociocultural. In other culture this would be taken as fraud but in India, its very common in a sense that it is everywhere. Where does this thing come from, whats the root? Is it religion, class difference? what is it? whenever I travel in India I ask this question to my self.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not taking away the fact that most women in the society have had to deal with tons of shit thrown at them. From struggling to getting proper education to getting provisions for maintaining basic hygiene, nothing is easy. And yes I admit this is just the issues I mentioned is just the tip of the ice berg. 

But in the corporate era which is slowly encouraging these snow flake, they are being vocal about absolutely any random thing. They pride themselves on being a feminist without really working on any such issues. They feel there are few women leaders because the men are gathering and deciding and denying them access to the higher chambers because ""why women"".  

I am from a MNC where women get paid on par and in quite a few  occasions even higher but you don't see men standing out with plaque cards. The best thing about the current stream of feminist is that they pick and choose what matters to them. I laud people who work on the grass root level to teach equality and strive for women to get the equal opportunity. For me thats the definition of feminism. Not coming out with slogans like "" Women support Women"", ""Women are the future"", ""Equal Pay BS"" or heck ""Why aren't there more women leaders"". 

Also I've noticed women from privileged background,  come out and play the victim card that women aren't really truly treated as equals in the corporate ladder. I personally haven't seen anything as such. instance. But happy to see if I've missed out on such observations.

She was very good in academics and sports in her school days. Secured &gt;95% in class 10 boards and top in her school. My parents, sent her to Kota for IIT prep at Bansal classes. Developed home sickness and depression, could not cope up with studies, and my parents were forced to cancel the classes and bring her back. Appointed psychiatrist, medication started. Meanwhile re-admitted to the same school for class 11 and 12. My parents dead set wanted her to do IIT and had her take some local institutes. She was so much focussed on IIT that she messed up her class 11 school marks, but passed, and also secured &gt;80% in class 12 boards. Meanwhile her mental condition was deteriorating and mending repeatedly and active change in medication. Gave AIEEE, did not make it.. My dad was disappointing. Got admitted in Kurukshetra University instead for B.Tech in Instrumentation. Mental condition again began going downhill, add it to terrible home sickness and ragging, she went completely crazy in her second year, She was causing unrest among her roommates, refused to take medication and tore apart her *suraksha kawach*(my dad is a strong superstitious and religious person). 

Again my parents brought her back and appointed another doctor in Delhi. She skipped a year. Resumed Uni after a year and graduated. Also got two job offers from campusing. She agreed on IBM and her training began in 2017 in Bangalore. Not even 6 months and again home sickness to the point that she resigned and came back home despite my parents and even me telling her to atleast think twice. 

Now I think my dad is to blame for some part. He was stubborn, violent and did not listen to anybody. He was extremely religious and superstitious. He also maintained a fake image before others. Spent WAY TOO less money(I consider myself upper middle class), and rarely he would take us to trips or spend on some new clothes. I mean maybe once in every 3 years... His behavior has definitely gotten better in recent years, maybe because I am bit rebellious as compared to my sister.

Fast forward to present, she is 24, and just sitting around in house, obese, no future plans, not willing to even do household chores. Mental situation has got much better but now she is just unwilling to do anything. Tried to get a bank job previous year but failed the interviews. Not listening to anybody not even the doctor. Now being a struggling class 11 myself I cannot give much time to her. Parents have already given up hope and thinking about marrying her off. To make situation worse my father is retiring later this year

I'm too old to be partying (38) and would only venture out maybe once or twice a week to goto to the cinema or some other form of entertainment. Are gated communities/societies worth considering, do they generally have shops so most everyday needs are met?  
&amp;nbsp;  
I want to avoid cities that are crazy hot/humid if possible. For the few months I'll probably visit various cities and use something like Airbnb and stay long enough to get a feel for the area.  
&amp;nbsp;  
What cities would you guys recommend based on what I wrote above?

**Screw Up Starts :**   
Startup experience has been great, immense learning but I fucked up. Company grew fast, 500 employees from 30 employees in 3 years, but I never gave my 100% and am stuck in a lower mid position.   
I get an overwhelming feeling now that I wasted my first five years of experience and got no advantage because of it. And these last 4 years have been high on learning but I have not moved forward.   


Never got to doing another degree for MBA, because I saw people from fancy schools doing the same job and same payscales. Now I feel horrible and stuck.   


**Options Ahead :**   
1. Stay where I am and hope for the best in terms of progression, its embarrassing now though because people far junior than I was are moving ahead of me  
2. Switch : similar profile might not give me the space I get here

4. Moving abroad : Too much uncertainty, Canada looks like a tempting option but I have a baby on the way and looks like it will not be possible to move out before two years. 

5. Own Startup : I do not have an idea which moves me enough to take the leap.

I contacted the seller and he reassured me by saying ""Please don't worry, everything will be fine"". Yeah, that's some reassurance for me alright.    
I'm not sure about what is going to happen from here. If anyone has ordered something from Aliexpress and faced a similar situation, can they share their experience from which I can gather some sense and then decide what to do next ?     
I looked it up on Quora and people were saying that clearing from Customs takes time and it'll be fine &amp; for some reason I don't buy it. If I have to pay duty, then what's the ballpark figure I'm looking at? I know the duty charged depends on the officer and is very subjective but it'd be good to know how much I'll be shelling out if I have to. 

Some information which might be relevant :-  
1.) I live in Delhi. The shipment seems to be stuck in Kolkata. I am assuming that they're going to send it to Delhi, so that I can visit the office and make my claim/argument.     
2.) My close relative works in the Custom department, would he be of any help if there's no way out of paying the duty ?

But honestly I've been too cut up about this. Using throwaway 


Backstory recap: fat girl, posh school, no friends, very middle class, supremely under confident, weird, nerd, no sense of style or fashion, very obnoxious 

I spent most of my childhood alone, with no one except my mom and dad for company and a motley crew of stray animals. I honestly did not have a single friend till 15 (she's still my best friend today though) and it wasn't an easy ride. I felt people don't really like me and that could be true because I would just clam up when faced with bullying or friendly interaction.

My father passed away at 16 and I went into a full nervous breakdown. I enrolled in college, still scared and obnoxious, but I could now talk to people. Not in a deep manner, more like in an unfeeling, small talk manner. Made a few friends and then dropped them because it was fucking intimidating.

Post a magnificently horrible relationship, I began to open up slowly and managed to get a whole group of friends in 2015-17. Which I lost after 3 of them pulled a prank on me that landed me in the ICU in the middle of the night. (I don't do harddrugs and don't honestly care if you do, but I got into an argument with one of the 'pranksters' who decided to spike my drink. On that night, I hadn't eaten a single thing all day, since I was doing intermittent fasting, and stopped by their house for a birthday drink before going home. They found opium along with a cocktail of drugs and pills in my system, it became a medico legal case, cops were called, the whole schbang).

I got into a serious relationship in 2016 (I'm married to him now, absolutely happy). 

Unfortunately, apart from him and two other close friends, I don't really have a friend group. He had a friend group, but he's a super introvert and from what I heard, he was the weirdo in that group.

I feel like I dragged him down with my unfriendability (not a word, please roll with it) even though he assures me that he only likes to spend time with a few of his close friends and cousins.

Why I'm rambling at 7 am when devastating and pressing issues are happening around the world: is this fucking normal? I'm totally content with not having a big group of friends and not having people to share everything with but I'm so guilt ridden that he's stuck with someone like me. 

I'm no longer weird or obnoxious, I've become fairly outgoing and I love talking and listening to people. But I have this weird gauge when the smallest things cause red flags to me and I can't stand certain things like bitching about a person when they're not there or bullying even when it's supposed to harmless.

I love people, I honestly do. I understand they have flaws. I know that I'm not everyone's cup of tea, but I cannot understand why I cannot maintain even superficial friendships..

The situation has become so bad that nowadays I have started paying the drivers by cash only; otherwise I won't be able to travel by Uber/Ola anywhere in the city...

Now I don't know the exact reason why they are insisting on cash payment only, but many drivers have told me that they need the cash to fill diesel/petrol daily.

I think they capture a genuine moment between father and daughter. I think the best part is that it's father and daughter, not mother and daughter, which is really striking. It shows that fathers have just as much of a responsibility towards their daughters as mothers. The moral they give is undoubtedly necessary.


**Naukri.com**
The Hari Sadu adverts I felt were great. Though, it may not have been top-notch comedy, it was certainly memorable enough that I still remember them.


**Coca-Cola**
The one with Siddhart Malhotra and Alia Bhatt playing the newly married couple. The presence of big stars actually takes away from the story, but their acting is muted enough that it passes. It impresses me that they were able to tone down their 'big star' personalities and really get into the characters. The story's strength is its simplicity. I do think that the ending is a bit too Bollywood/melodramatic, tho.

The **Coca-Cola** 'Taste the Feeling' (one with the Avicii song) and **Gillette** 'Best A Man Can Get' adverts are awesome, but they're not Indian so they don't actually count.

I've worked with agencies and as a freelancer. I'm 23 now and I'm feeling stagnant and lost in my career. I have tried few jobs but I eventually I ending up going back to freelancing, mainly because I feel the the job culture is not really healthy - long hours, office politics and exhausting commute. I know this is something I cannot completely escape from. I'm ready to put up with this if the work/clients are really exciting and challenging, and the job environment is good and offers growth and learning scope. So when I start to feel that the job is not worth it anymore, I quit. The longest I've been at a job is 1 year, 7 months.

I like graphic design and want to continue in this field.But I'm not sure what should I really do next. 

I currently have two freelance projects (through my friends, I'm not good at sales and marketing), so I can survive as of now but this can't go go on forever, unless projects start flowing in consistently.

I'm tired of the job hunting, I am not able to find anything that makes me stay for at least 2-3 years.

I don't know if this is a good idea, but I'm thinking of doing a certification or diploma while I keep looking for work. But my budget is upto 1 -1.5 Lacs. I want to do it only from a good institute (Faculty and placement wise), other wise I know it's not worth, I still have a lot to learn but I'm not a complete beginner either. Till now I haven't found a suitable course either. Only full time(4-5 years) degree course or crash courses are available here in Mumbai.

I'm someone who believes that a job/ career should not be the only thing that defines a person. But lately, this has been bothering me a lot. Especially, when I look at others who are my age and doing so much better than me. This has started affecting me so much that my doctor has suggested psychological therapy.

Any kind of suggestions, advice and guidance will be helpful. What will be the next best step for me? Please be polite.

Thanks :)

This was shocking. I immediately checked my card number and it did not match the one on the receipt. I even checked my account balance and there was no such transaction made.

Thankfully, I am safe with my money. I re-read the message and saw that second link was HTTP and not HTTPS. Which clearly identifies itself as fraud.

I got married recently, My parents are not influential or rich. Just an average middle class dude working in a software company. In my day to day life other than traffic police I do not cross roads with anything government.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I applied for marriage certificate, police clearance certificate and my wife applied for her passport. Each of these times I paid bribe. I paid 2000/- at sub registrar office 200 and 500 respectively for police. I thought I will get marriage certificate without paying anything. But it seemed impossible and we needed it for my wife's passport. Same is the case with passport and police clearance. I cannot keep taking days off at work to get those things done by not paying bribe. I cannot fight the system because that would have more severe consequences on my career/ life.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was thinking about this, what can I do about these things. 

&amp;#x200B;

should I keep fighting them. Is that a wise battle to choose? 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I a jerk to encourage corruption? 

&amp;#x200B;

How to get things done without paying anything?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I report them now? Again I am afraid of consequences where normality in my life gets disturbed.

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

Trouble is Paytm is refusing to let us use that money because no KYC has been done. We really don't want to get a KYC done with Paytm because it was asking us to open an account with Paytm bank - which is something which all of us are dead against.

Is there a solution to this ?

I researched a bit and I feel there is still a growing demand for IoT professionals in the industry. I have been working as an entrepreneur and in the family business both of which weren't tech based. I have always been intrigued by electronic devices and thanks to the arduino platform, I learnt a lot of core electronics and embedded systems tech purely as a hobby. I've developed several home projects based on several Atmel processors, ESPs and Raspberry Pi(s). I wish to jump into IoT as a career now and for that I am posting this while I research the options.

The course from BITs is mostly geared towards working professionals and is priced quite high too. They do not have any placement assistance either. Im thinking maybe I should try getting into a job right away? I am handy with a few programming languages like C,C++, Javascript, HTML CSS, Angular, Ionic and the MySQL database, and I also know basic circuit design, worked with a lot of sensors and micro-controllers.

My current situation - I am getting ""good"" marks (9+ CGPA in 1st semester, out of out in all internals etc) but I know it doesn't mean much considering it's a BBA degree and my age is a problem. I am not really doing any other skill development courses (but I should). The degree is in a okayish college that has a robust placement program.



So I am afraid that I have fucked up my life beyond repair. I am not sure I will get placed as I will be graduating at 27 with no meaningful prior work experience. I am thinking of govt competitive exams (like UPSC and bank manager exams) but those are next level and I am not sure if it is realistic. So I have to keep a backup career plan.



Please advise me on the following -

- what competitive exams should I be looking at and preparing for?

- should I prepare for higher education ie MBA? Any recommendations?

- should I prepare for getting placed when I am in 3rd year? If so, how?

Based off how small the states are in the northeast it's possible I could get to see 2 more states in the region (trying to stick to specific states to explore them in as much depth as possible).

I think I can speak for many when I say that it's what I turn to when shit gets dark. Looking back over a decade, I can see that as long as I've been depressed I've had some anime to turn to on the side. 

I've never really become an Otaku though the last year has been tough and perhaps I've been on the path, as a NEET of sorts. Either ways, I felt there would be some here who would empathize.

One of the challenges of discussing anime is that everyone has their own personal list of must-recommends, and not many seem interested in your own lists. I guess it's like YouTube, everyone has their space and curations.

I've just started watching EVA. It feels nice to go back to the 90s for a change. And while I always perceived this as a 'weeb' anime for some reason, I watched a few YouTube videos on why people love it and realized it's sort of about depression as well. Four episodes in and I can see how compelling this show is.
 
The last anime I fell in love with was Samurai Champloo (which introduced me to Nujabes and the genre that evolved to become Low Fi). I watched that show for the music and the smooth storytelling. I wanted to be like Mugen - badass hardened street rat who's seen the world and is wise to it. But also like Jin, someone who has a deep inner calm. And a bit like Fuu, who creates the adventure, and who knows it's about the journey over the destination.

Starting a thread for people to talk about the anime they watch and how it makes them feel. Like, for example, why do you watch shonen anime - and do you feel it's inspired you to make your lives better?

First ever event for Sexual Expression and awareness, called ""Tongue Tied"" - [https://www.meraevents.com/event/tongue-tied](https://www.meraevents.com/event/tongue-tied)

It's a women only event happening on 20th Sun in Delhi where they are talking about intimate sexual experiences, desires, and emotions in a safe and compassionate space.

For all interested, this can be an opportunity to reflectively think and gain confidence and courage to communicate and express your sexual inhibitions and desires.

How do I start a conversation with a girl who I may be arranged married to?,"So, this is the first time I'm making a reddit account or a post. I have been a lurker here for a long time but never really bothered to make an account, but this time I had to because I am need of help.

So I have gotten to that age, where my parents have started asking me about my plans for the future and well they were hinting at my marriage. This conversation has been going on for about a year now, and I do not mind getting married in 2 years or so. Currently I'm a medical student in the UK in the final year of my course and my parents are quite liberal/progressive. They honestly asked me if I have any girlfriends or ever had any and what my plans for the future are (they are already aware of my career plans and were pretty much asking for my plans for marriage). 

I told my parents truthfully that I have neither been in a relationship, nor have I ever attempted to even have a minor relationship in my life. I have been the kind of person that preferred the single life the whole time. However, my opinion is now changing and I'm all up for some sort of partner. My parents asked me if they could help me find a partner for my life, and I agreed. My parents had a love marriage between themselves but personally I do not mind getting an arranged marriage at all. So after awhile, I told my parents what I was looking for in a girl and they spun their contacts in India and managed to find one. They gave me her contact details (she is in a similar situation and is a medical student from India) and asked me to have a chat with her and get to know her in my own time. So here we are, I have her contact details but I don't exactly know how to start the conversation here...

My dad told me to just message her how I would message my friends and go from there... but of course this is easier said then done. I can't help feel that there is some awkwardness present here and I don't exactly want to ruin first impressions either. So my fellow redditors how exactly do I slide into these DMs (please keep in my mind, I have 0 game nor have I ever tried to slide into DMs or ever thought I would find myself in this situation).",,ayx2ap,,0,,false,1560158404,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/ayx2ap/help_how_do_i_start_a_conversation_with_a_girl/,,,false,AskIndia,

* I have 2 MTNL SIM cards in my phone.
* 1st card is for data, 2nd card is for online accounts/bank OTP, Steam authentication etc.
* Why I don't have other network providers Jio etc. = 3G internet is fine for me, My 1st MTNL SIM gets 10GB data/month according to Broadband Companion SIM offer, and its enough for me since majority of my internet usage happens on PC.
* I have no need for unlimited calling/data plans as of now, so I haven't ported my 2nd SIM either.
* I have minimal amount of balance in both cards for emergency and to keep the number alive...

I want to clarify that just because this is a rant on MTNL, it doesn't mean that other network providers don't have this issue, I had this same problem with Airtel, Idea years ago.

**HERE WE GO**

My 1st MTNL card had 10Rs. before I received this non-requested OTP. I decided to ignore the OTP since I didn't request it, and I thought that without access to my phone, whatever service is mentioned won't be activated. But for some reason it was still subscribed to some ""GOLD service"" without my authorization.

[2](https://i.redd.it/l5fj1e135ba21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

[3](https://i.redd.it/4cv35bf45ba21.jpg)

I called the MTNL customer support, and they kept blaming it on me. They kept saying that I provided my number in lucky draw in malls etc. TBH I haven't provided this number anywhere (literally), it is strictly for data and emergency calls. In worst case scenario, even if I did provide this number somewhere, it shouldn't possible to subscribe my SIM to unauthorized services. 3rd image pretty much includes ""mtnlmm"" in given site....

After a long ass argument they filed my complaint and I received the refund of Rs.10, but when I asked them that how was someone just able to subscribe my SIM to some VAS service, they didn't have any answer.

So yesterday I read the thread about DND on this sub, and I did the 1909 SMS method.

&amp;#x200B;

[4](https://i.redd.it/ity1mozjkba21.png)

I sent 4 SMS to 1909, and just after that I checked my balance and guess what..Rs.4 were deducted. Isn't this supposed to be a toll-free number? After this I called customer support AGAIN, they said that my balance was deducted because some promotional SMS was sent to me, when I checked the number they gave me, this was the message.

&amp;#x200B;

[5](https://i.redd.it/vdulw7emlba21.png)

So MTNL is claiming that, an incoming SMS is what caused my balance to be deducted.....I even have a recorded call of two of the customer support people clearly saying this...

At this point idk which method actually deducted money from my balance, DND activation or a fucking ""INCOMING SMS"".

TBH both shouldn't be charging me money, but my suspicion goes towards the DND activation, since it matches the amount of charge 4 SMS costs, and I had past experiences with mtnl charging on toll-free numbers of banks etc. And how the fuck does an incoming SMS costs me Rs.4? does that even make sense?

**HELP ME PLEASE**  

**Edit 1 :** Today another Rs.4 deduction occurred. When I called customer support, they said ""We are not able to file your complaint, your number doesn't show up in our system"". I asked them if I can talk to their senior, they said ""I have taken your complaint in writing"". That's all I got for calling them for 3 days, 10Rs. refund, again 9 Rs. deduction (so far) and now my number doesn't exist in their system all of a sudden?  

I really hope some MTNL senior sees this post, I smell insider job. No wonder MTNL is in loss, their 4G and fiber is non-existent and their 3G and ADSL service is horrible.",,afse91,,0,,false,1552641608,false,https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/mXG5rJa265p7FGtR2TRQn0pKh8iqkzVvbLm0_pYWPa8.jpg,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,maharashtra,false,true,,/r/india/comments/afse91/network_providers_and_vaswap_push_scam/,,Maharashtra,false,AskIndia,

But of late, after 40, I have been losing erections after some time and need to get stimulated again to get it back. I have no problems getting an erection, but I have seemingly lost that ability to sustain it continuous without stimulation for a long time as I always could earlier.

Since I don't think this is exactly a Viagra problem, I thought that maybe I could try an Ayurvedic course for a few days and see if it makes a difference. But there is a bewildering variety available there.

There are mixtures of different things like Himalaya Tentex Forte, Zandu Vigorex, Stay-On, Patanjali Musli Paak, Baidyanath Vita Ex etc. And then there are stand alone single ingredient stuff like Shilajit, Kapakacchu, Ashwagandha etc.

From resume writing tips to how to answer some of the most dreaded questions during an interview. I can't thank you guys enough.

I need your advice again. So, a little background. I completed my masters in Marketing ( Not MBA) last August and have been working as a freelance writer ever since. Technically, I should be working as an assistant professor right now ( have all the certifications), but due to an ongoing Supreme Court case regarding reservations in University rosters, all new openings for teaching positions were suspended indefinitely. As a result, I wasn't able to get a teaching job and started working as a freelancer.

Now, the freelance thing doesn't pay very well, so I want to transition to a regular job at an advertising agency.

I had a very hard time finding an entry level job anywhere, so I started applying for internships. (I turned 24 in December )

I have gotten acceptance letters from 2 places, and I can't decide.Both the companies pay exactly the same.Please help me choose

Company 1 - Biggest Media House in my Country, one way distance from my place - 31.3 kms , One way travelling time - 2 hours, Event based internship ( Only 2 months), very little chance of a job offer unless I do something exceptional

Company 2 - Local Ad Agency, Near to my place, 5.2 kms away, 20-30 minutes travelling time, moderate chance of job offer

Is a big brand name on my CV valuable to future employers ? Will it make a huge difference considering the fact that I'm a fresher ? (Both are digital marketing internships )

So here is a cat who used to eat daily from dustbins and other place wherever she could find food , she used to drop the dustbin of my home at night and used to search for food and eat whatever she gets . But , one day I saw the cat and offered her some food she ate that fast and so I gave her some more. Since that day she has started showing up daily at my door  so I bought a small packet of dry cat food from a local pet store but my dilemma is that I am a student and it wont be possible for me to buy cat food everytime and for the same reason I cannot adopt her. Also I didn't find any cat shelters in my city. This cat waits daily before I come home from my coaching and meows many time when she sees me , also after I give her the food then also she meows for an extended period of time which really makes my heart melt and I feel really sad for this cat. From the looks of it she is not injured in any way. But since I won't be able to support this cat everytime I am not sure what should I do , should I stop feeding this cat I am not sure. But I am really worried for this cat.

I don't want to ask for more money from home because it'll only increase the burden on my family. So, basically i thought of getting a part-time job which i'll do in my spare time. I prefer a work from home job because my college has strict policies regarding attendance and they won't let me sit in the internals if i don't have more than 75% attendance!!

I know python, java, C/C++, mySQL and recently learning how to use Linux. Any help and advice is appreciated! THANKS!

5. While calculating the TDS, does my employer straight-away cut 30% or does it take the exemptions into account as well?

And it's no secret there are fewer opportunities after 10+ experience as programmer.

Kid is still in nursery. Wife is stay at home mom.

Options I am considering are Canada, Germany, UK, Netherlands and USA(mission impossible nowadays).
I had received an offer to work in Europe but I felt salary was low. After some research it seems salaries are fairly low in Europe and infact everywhere except USA and Switzerland.

I am fine with both approaches -
1. Move permanently and seek citizenship
2. Earn good money and come back after 5+ years.

So I ride up to the place on my bike and the place is real busy. I see no parking signs on the street however there is room available in front of the building renting the food placee for bike parking. The curb in front of the building doesn't have a ramp but the side of the building on the smaller side road does ( this is a corner building with a main road on the front and a side road on the left ).  Anyway there was a car parked blocking the side entrance and as a result lot of bikes were parked on the side street. I make a couple of circles tying to find a spot with no luck, doubling down to squeeze through I somehow managed to squeeze between the car and a tree to get through and park my bike in front of the building. ( So this is not on the footpath but the space between that and the building. )

Went about my lunch we had a great time catching up. I was in a good mood, time to part and I get on my bike to go home while my friend walked off the side road. 

So the building has an unmarked business?! shop!? I don't know what it was but had one of those office like doors put in with a window. This office is in the basement of the building. As I'm getting the bike out this lady sees me from the window rushes out and proceeds to command me ""Next time you come here, I don't want you parking there!"" . It took me a second to understand what she was saying. Not wanting to deal with her I shrug my shoulders and ignore here. This set her off, blew her lid off. She proceeds to repeat and add that parking is not allowed here. I did point out there arnt any No Parking signs on this place. She says "" that does not matter, there is no parking here"". I insist on the point and point to I'm here that on I'm not encroaching on private property, it like has a chain fence like short wall and I was outside that. She keeps ignoring what I'm saying and insists on the no parking adding "" this is a business, how can we do business if there are parked bikes in front of it"". I mean lady, come on! First I'm not even obstructing your business entrance, second your business doesn't even have any signs, who in the world would look at something like that and even guess that there's a legit business there.

  


I had enough of here, I asked her to call the cops if she has a problem. Pissed off she storms in, comes back and prooceeds to slam shut the door of her own business.

  


With all this said Am I the Asshole for doing what I did? The whole thing bothered me for a couple days.

  


tldr: park in a legit spot in front of a building, lady owning a business in the building proceeds to command me like she's my mom, we exchange words with her slamming the door of her own business and me end up bothered by it for next few days

So, come on fellow mechanical engineers, roll up your sleeves and tell us something on the lines of below topics...

1. Studying or working? Where( only if you want to) , what field and what do you do at work?
2. Why did you pick mechanical engineering( honest answers please!) and what do you like about your job?
3. What do you think about the state of mechanical engineering education and engineers in India?
4. Coolest project you've worked on or dream about working on...

EDIT : Disguised*


I'm a Mechatronics final year student at one of the mediocre colleges here. My parents are middle class folks who have always supported and encouraged me for further studies. They always said  ""You study as much as you want without worrying about the financial aspects, we will take care of that"" but always in a passive aggressive way. 

So abiding by that single sentence, in my sophomore year I decide that I'll do a Master's and then a PhD. I made up my mind that I won't look for a job or anything since I'll be going for higher studies. Keeping that in mind I spent the next 2 years making sure that I have a "" research oriented"" academic profile. You know, writing research papers, book chapters, research internship in France and yada yada. Last November I gave my GRE and stuff and got a 320+ score so I also opted out of my campus placements (not that they were any good anyway 5-6 lpa max) 

Last month I got into University of Maryland and Colorado School of Mines, which again are mediocre colleges at best. When I told my dad he said that it wasn't good enough and doesn't have money to put me through Graduate school. I was appalled. I mean all my college life he told me to focus on studying further regardless of anything. I opted out of placements, didn't give GATE just so I could focus on GRE and stuff. Now he wanted me to take a drop after college and give GATE to which I said NO without hesitation. After lot of yelling and fighting he said that he'll take up a loan or something for 1 year of my Master's degree. 

I don't have the temperament for GATE I know this much. I have no job options since I opted out of on- campus placements. I just don't know what to do anymore. I have no options left. I feel like such a failure in life. My dad never missed a chance to point out that I couldn't get into IIT so all my college life I worked my ass off just so I could make him happy. To show him that I'm worth something. You know, like I was happy when I got I'm to CSM and UMD, I felt like I accomplished something. I thought he'd be happy but when I told him he's like ""it's not good enough, I expected something like Stanford or so"". And then I realized myself that no matter what I do, how much I work, I'll never get past the mediocre line, I'll never be good enough.

Now, I feel bad for him taking a loan for my education. I mean what's the point of going from one mediocre college to another mediocre college. And also, now I'm constantly worried about the ""what ifs"" and other things. What if I don't get a good job? What if I couldn't adjust to the American education system? What if I don't get a TA or RA-ship? What if I can't contribute to paying off the student loans? Is it worth spending 35 lakhs per annum for a Masters program? Earlier, I had everything laid out : I'll do a Master's from a good University and become a PhD student at the same University. Now, all my plans are ruined now since I have to worry about getting a good paying job. I am just so fed up of thinking the same thing over and over and over again for the last couple of weeks. And it's not like I can talk it out with my parents bc we don't talk much about how we feel.  I don't know what I should do, I don't know how should I feel. I'm just so scared of the unknown and the what ifs. I feel nothing more than a liability to my family.

3. Is Mi Air Purifier good enough? I will be living in a 1RK flat.

I have been put on performance watch/probation in the team I joined nine months back. Apologies for the long story post, please bear with me.","  

Hi randia! I work in an MNC and in June last year I switched to a reputed team within the organisation. Only the top performers from the best undergrad colleges (think Stephens, Hindu, SRCC, NSIT, DTU etc.) are hired there. I am also from one of these colleges, however, I had to take a longer route and work in a different organisation and then in a different team within this MNC, prove myself, to finally move to this team. After four long years, it was a dream come true.

But, somehow, I always carried that baggage of inferiority with myself that stabbed my confidence (utmost requirement in the field). I survived five months - made some mistakes, learnt a lot and tried to improve myself. However, in November, my manager suddenly told to me that I was not performing up to the mark and there were red flags - my accuracy was low, my communication was weak and my ""passion"" was not visible. I took that feedback constructively and we identified areas where i was lacking the most and targeted them. However, that negative feedback and the way it was delivered broke something brittle inside me that I was building up for the past four months. 

I worked harder, and during the next four months, I had regular meetings with my manager and he said things are going ""fine"", I am improving, but the benchmarks are moving ahead and we are playing catchup. I thought its progress and I can still do it as long as things are ""fine"".

However, last week, I received my quarterly review and I was told that i have been put on performance watch and I should get in touch with HR. I have a meeting with HR tomorrow and I feel clueless. 

On a sidenote, I am unhappy with the work that I am doing; I have been thinking of shifting or going for an MBA abroad; I have a job offer as my manager in my previous organisation has begun a startup and offered me a position. 

   
 

TL;DR: I moved to a reputed team in June; made some mistakes; my manager framed a perspective; From Nov-Feb, I improved and things were going fine but still playing catchup with benchmarks according to my manager and now suddenly I am on performance watch. I am still sore from the fucking last week. Next steps?

Hi [r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india), I should clarify that I'm Indian, but I was born and raised in the States (I'm 20) but I visit my grandparents and extended family every year or every other year. I did all my schooling there but I was kind of wondering what certain aspects of culture is in India, mostly because my parents are constantly telling me how easy I have it socially. My question is in regards to what type of drinking culture, LGBT culture, attitudes towards sex/ relationships/dating outside of an arrangement, and what's the school culture like in regards to school work and work ethic? My parents have always told me that I've had it easy with my friends of the opposite gender, a generally tolerant view of LGBT people in my state, and a prevalent alcohol culture compared to them. They both grew up in/ near Chennai and have both talked about how they didn't have friends of the opposite sex, and didn't have an alcoholic drink until they got to the States. They said they hadn't even heard of LGBT people until arriving in the United States. I'm just asking this question because I'd like to know the effects of more Westernization than my parent's generation (they're in their late 40's). I've seen questions on Quora and Reddit but they've been answered by either older adults or boys (nothing wrong with boys, I'd just love a relatable answer from another girl but I'll take whatever answer I can get lol).

There are two members in their family. Member A is the husband and Member B is the wife. The ‘suspect’ is the wife though let’s stick to the family for this discussion. Whenever the family are in their flat, the water supply finishes within 2 hours of the water being supplied from the municipality and filled in the building’s tank. The problem is 6 families live in this building with the 6th being in rent so they don’t care about this according to them. The culprit’s family and two more always support each other (because they are brothers and actual family) and then there’s my family and one other who have tried to confront the family time and again and get simply a weak response claiming that maybe the water force is weak or the pump doesn’t work well. Now the issue here is we have changed the building’s water pump twice and also confirmed that the force is strong from a municipality personnel but the water shortage still remains. 

Now comes the sad part. Whenever the suspected family leaves for a few days, the water supply of the building comes back to normal (i.e. water lasts full days). This is absolutely proven and even the other families supporting the suspected sometimes blurt this out. 

Not only am I complaining about the water shortage but also of the huge amount of water wastage done by that family at a time where a few significant number of countries don’t even have water to bathe. 

Whenever the family is home and the water from municipality comes at its designated time, we can hear a lot of water flowing down the pipes (thanks to the thin walls). 

Since the we don’t have majority support to properly confront the suspected family we are looking for a legal option. We don’t prefer the police (even though we might look into this option) because of the links of the family with the ruling political party. 

Any help will be godsend in this situation. 

Please note that it’s been around 5 years that we’ve been living like this where water goes out every 2 hours and only get water supply for a total of 4 hours a day (since water comes twice). Every fact mentioned here is extremely accurate and I and the other family supporting us is will to swear on this (if we go down the legal route)

MY COUSIN BROTHER IS DOING IT RUGHT NOW. IN K O T A. THEIR COUSIN BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE DOING IT TOO. AND ONE OF THEM WENT TO IIT. 


I did manage to get a 90 percentile in the JEE Mains but why would that matter when my cousin brother got 99.95 and is probably getting a rank between 20-50 AIR because he went for c o a c h i n g c l a S S e s ���� I couldn’t score well in pre boards because my school has a grade deflation policy so we don’t get gassed up for the actual boards and EVERYDAY I GET TO HEAR HIM SAY “IF YOU WENT TO COACHING CLASSES THINGS WIULD BE BETTER” LIKE NO 


I’ve told him just because I didn’t attend coaching doesn’t mean I’m doing any less work than those who did. It’s true - they invest their time purely in academia whereas mine’s a little scattered over numerous things which are important to my domain - writing essays, extracurriculars, school tests etc.

It’s honestly hell. Anytime anything wrong goes with my school record like a test I couldn’t do well on, I don’t get encouraged on doing better next time - instead he goes on about how I had just O N E thing to do the entire year (study for boards) and I couldn’t even do that whereas people who go to coaching manage BOTH JEE and boards omg what would the world be without them ���������� the true heroes of our nation ����

&lt;/rant&gt;

What do I do now? I don’t appreciate the unhealthy pressure I’m facing at such a critical point in my life. Should I tell my school counsellor?

Is there any argument which can shut him up for at least a month? 

Any advice from people who were in my shoes is greatly appreciated. Please help!

I am 30 years old and I have only recently started making enough money that I can start saving and investing. I am new to investing and have done some research on mutual funds, PPF, etc.

Here are a few things -
* 1. I can invest/save around Rs.10,000/- per month, maybe even stretch it to Rs.15,000/-. (Edit: On second thought, there is no reason I cannot invest Rs.15k per month considering I have very few expenses.
* 2. I do not fall into the bracket of taxable income - as of now, my income is not subject to IT since it falls within the exemption limit of 5L.
* 3. I do not have any financial obligations such as rent, groceries, etc. since I live with my parents who are financially independent. My only expenditures are my own cellphone bills, going out with friends, etc.
* 4. I have health insurance cover of 5L
* 5. I know that financial goals are very important in determining what kind of instruments one should invest in, but as of now, my only goal is to save money for the future.

Emergency Fund - I have read that when it comes to saving, one should start with an emergency fund, and that sounds like good advice to me. What are the best options to set up an emergency fund which is liquid in nature? The few options that I know of are - RD, Savings Schemes of various financial institutions that give ~6-7% RoI but with some risk, or just park it in a different Savings Bank account and hide the ATM card? What would be a good amount to set aside every month for the emergency fund?

PPF - Being a long term and safe investment that would give a steady rate of 8% CI, is it a good investment in the day and age of mutual funds which give you more than 10% RoI? Especially since tax saving u/s 80C is not my goal right now and I can afford to park my funds in other places.

SIP/Mutual Funds - What are some good mutual funds one can invest in? And how long should I be parking my funds in it? I’d like to invest in SIPs since I don’t have a large enough corpus to invest right now. 

Tools to invest - Most of all, what are the best tools to use for investing and savings? There are many apps out there like ETMoney, PayTM Money, etc. Which ones do you recommend and why?

I understand that I am very late to the game and I should start investing aggressively for the future.

Thanks for all the help in advance!

Let me take an example of the previous 777 plan and compare it with the new plan.

The old plan was - upto 50 Mbps till 500 GB, upto 2Mbps beyond.

The updated plan is - upto 50 Mbps till 18 GB/day, upto 2Mbps beyond(This would amount to 540 GB on average per month).

At first glance it would look like an improvement over the previous plan, but here's the kicker the Updated plan forces you to use the 18GB per day instead of the old plan which allowed you to use any amount of data at the 50 Mbps speed per day as long as you were below the 500 GB fup.

If u were to use more than 18 GB/day on the updated plan, the speed would go down to 2 Mbps after 18 GB on that day (fup on a daily basis).

If u were to use less than 18 GB/day on the updated plan ,the remaining data would be lost therefore under-utilizing the plan.

Edit: The 777 and 1277 plans have been reverted to the previous ""500GB"" and ""750 GB"" respectively. Thanks to the reddit user u/abtam11 for notifying about the changes.

[https://telecomtalk.info/bsnl-rs777-broadband-plan-removal/190707/](https://telecomtalk.info/bsnl-rs777-broadband-plan-removal/190707/) 

TLDR: The Updated plan basically enforces an fup on a daily basis instead of a monthly basis which is unacceptable on a brodband connection.

1. It's unfortunate that the board is damaged. It was sent in mint condition, the courier guys must have dropped it.
2. The defects are minor, it won't affect playing. 
3. They cannot replace the board because as per ""their policy"" they won't replace if there is no issue with the playing area. \[BTW, this policy is not mentioned anywhere on their website\]
4. I should try to fix it with feviquick.
5. I should ""consider"" the fact that already they have given a ""discounted"" product, if customer buys from another shop/online store it will cost Rs. 11,000
6. I should play on the board and see if the playing area is okay.

\---

After this I tested the playing area of the board. Due to the crack near middle of one side, the rebound was not coming properly. I made this video and sent it to him \[Link to video in comments\]

Below is our discussion over call with him after sending the video \[link in comments\]

According to him, it is nobody's fault that they board got damaged! We should pay the return courier charges if we want replacement. The board weighs 25kg, it will be costly affair to send it to Mumbai from Bangalore.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my wife are both frustrated. Having spent so much on a defective board. Had the board been available on Amazon or some other online store with decent return policy, we would have ordered from there.

Idk what to do.

Xiomi said they can’t issue a replacement and asking me to consult with amazon.

While Amazon says that they’re not responsible for anything after the 10 day replacement policy.

I was facing issues since day 2 and When the amazon technician visited to check, he said everything is fine.

Now both amazon and xiomi are denying responsibility to anything.

My Moto G5 runs smoother than my MI A2.

Is there anything I can do?

Edit: Also my phone heats upto 45 degrees.

Xiaomi said that it is normal which I don’t beleive. They probably have the worst customer service I’ve ever seen.

I’m from Thane/Mumbai if that helps.


Edit 2: Went to the service center and showed them the temperature is 47 degree celcious. Manager was very casual stating it is normal for the phone to be 47-50 during summer.

Had to argue a lot with him to get my phone checked and I’m sure that it will again be just a factory reset.

Amazon said they will issue a replacement if MI provides a denial letter but the MI service center is refusing that letter saying that we’re not refraining from providing you a service. Your device is fine and blah blah bs so there’s no need for such letter.

Contacted the Xiomi customer care via mail. Let’s see where this goes.

Will keep everyone updated.

Airtel and Vodafone-Idea are not helping either, with roughly matching Jio tariffs.

Though it may be true that with the advent of Jio, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea have had to reduce their tariffs, and that the cost-per-GB is now in varying single digits, but FUP still keeps users from utilising their data fairly.

Here's a solution. There are currently no plans on any operator, apart from Jio, that offer a non-FUP high-capacity 4G data. Airtel and Vodafone-Idea could offer high-capacity non-FUP data plans with varying validities, including free calls, text, and roaming.

Example: Jio currently offers a total of 42 GB 4G data for ₹149, but this allows the subscriber to use a maximum of 1.5 GB 4G data each day for 28 days, including free calls and text. Airtel and Vodafone-Idea could match this offer and others like it, but without FUP.

It makes no sense to access the internet at 2G speeds in 2019. Hope someone in Airtel and/or Vodafone-Idea is reading.

I (26/F) am of indian origin. While I speak and understand hindi/punjabi fluently, I moved out of the country when i was a toddler. I recently got engaged to my white American SO. 
We(Finace, his family and I) were planning on visiting india so I can visit with my extended relatives still in india.  I have not met many of them in decades and my parents think its a good idea to introduce them to my new lovely family. We plan to visit Punjab (extended family) and do some sight seeing in Gujrat and Kerela. Heard a lot about these beautiful states.
Due to my and my parent's own limited experience with India and its current culture, it would be helpful to have answers to the following questions:  
1- What are some things I need to share with my Fiance and his family before we visit ( outside of the reglar crowds, traffic, culture etc)  
2- What kind of reaction can i expect from the general public to an interracial couple while walking around on the streets(Apoligies if this sounds offensive, I just thought its better to ask so i can ber prepared.)  
3-My parents want me to tell everyone (except our family) that my fiance and I are already married so we get less suspiciously looked at while travelling around (for eg at hotels etc). However, I dont want to lie unless i absolutely have to. Would would you suggest?

I believe its error at their end. What do i do - lawyer or consumer court.,"Quick Summary - My spouse &amp; I are under a single policy. I had mentioned no pre-existing conditions for me &amp; my spouse during policy purchase. I have a genetic blood condition which is non-treatable (lets call it condition - XYZ for now) it doesn't affect anything and i dont take any meds for this. During a regaulr checkup 4 weeks back, we found my spouse to have a thyroid issue. The next week, she met with an accident and had to operated and we applied to cashless claim, which was pre-authorised approved. During the hospitalization we told the hospital about thyroid issue which was mentioned. Now during the final billing by insurance company asked for thyroid details - send first consultation doucment, which we did. In that consultation doc, it was mentioned about my genetic condition. So the insurance company rejected the cashless claim saying that they need to further investigate into the matter as there are ""pre-exiting diseases"".Â 
I spoke to their customer agent and he basically told me that any issue like thyroid etc need to told to the company as soon as it is discovered, and that my statement of no-preexisting disease for the prime holder (which is me) also needs to be investigated. The customer support told me that I can write to their grievance cell (Whcih has no phone, just email) and that i can do a reimbursement, but I don't think they will entertain it.
What I find wrong is - There is no explicit mention of us intimating the insurance company about any condition as soon as we know. And my medical condition is nothing to do with what we are claiming for. To me, it looks like they are just finding out a reason to deny the claim.Â 

What can I do here? Should I consult a lawyer and get him to go through my policy doc and take this case forward, or should I go to consumer court etc. Any input is highly appreciated.

I'm trying to look for better jobs in the same field. I already know some intermediate ReactJS and now learning Nodejs(along with ExpressJS and socket.io)  and making some projects to showcase myself. I attended 2 interviews last month with no luck. In my last interview, I got asked only about Data Structures and Algorithms and I didn't know they ask that even in WebDev field. So how should I prepare for interviews? Should I hone my DSA skills or keep making projects/portfolio? What other skills are important besides these?

Also, the guy who selected me in my current company initially told me they would increase my pay after 2 months depending on my performance. So far, no news from him. Should I remind him/ask him about my pay?

Thanks in advance :)

2. The card fails to work with 90% POS terminals. The chip doesn't work, and when the stripe is used as a secondary way, it says use chip. Sometimes, it'll go upto the PIN phase and then decline transaction, with more than enough balance available to cover the transaction.

Ultimately i want to be a Professor and do research in Japanese culture or become a professor there."" Now this came as a shock to us, this guy wants to settle in Japan, that too was okay if it was a traditional field,but this is off the beaten track. I told him that i would be hard for him to be accepted in Japan because of their prejudices and all. But he is hell bent on it. Now he wants to go out to pursue +2 from a big city where he can study Japanese too.

Considering he is just 16 and from a very small town,I just want to know:

 1. How feasible is his plan?

 2. If, he has to pursue +2 from any place in India considering his ambition, where should he go and which School/College should he apply to ?

 3. Any alternatives ?

I have asked this question before and people were kind enough to advise me to pursue a master's degree in zoology.

However, as you can see, I don't have a good percentage in Bsc. The main reason for this is that though I joined Bsc in 2015, it was only for the sake of name. I had to actually prepare for medical during the first two years, and only gave minimum time towards Bsc. God knows I saved myself from  a 2nd division by studying like crazy in my final year.

However, now I'm afraid as the government has put restrictions on age limit... iirc, most institutions have put in age limits of 24-25 for UR students, this gives me just 1 or 2 chances to get a govt. job.

This has severely affected my productivity. Earlier, I used to study for 10+ hours a day,
; now I procrastinate, and only one thought goes through my mind, ""What will I do if I don't get a job?""

I have no friends, no social life, no social media, and only whatsapp which I check only when my parents tell me to. Reddit is just for questions like these.

I'm honestly terrified of my future. What if I stay jobless my entire life? What will happen after my dad retires in 2/3 years? How will I help my parents?

Hi, I'm a class 11 student going into 12th currently prepping for jee (pcm with economics) and basically I have various fields that I'm interested in, like basically almost all fields like econ, math, chemistry etc. and I'm very confused as to what path to take. In order of preference I like :
economics/math, chemistry then physics
(Note: there's not a big gap between all 4, but just a general layout)

I feel physics is ok and chemistry a bit better but it seems too much memorization.

I most likely want to work in R&amp;D in the field I join. I just feel that I would enjoy that type of work much more. I do not want to do a PhD as I don't think I will like academia and it's environment as such and 5 years I feel is too long for education. Im still thinking about it and trying not to jump to conclusions.

I do have a lot of interest (more than the others) in psychology (especially cognitive) and philosophy but I did not really think about it a lot as I have heard you need a doctorate to do meaningful work and if not most people end up becoming HR managers or something. I could not find a lot of data to research about this field though in India, abroad scenario is decent. 

I liked an applied maths or stats(didn't consider pure as found it to be too abstract) but in that case I'm scared I'm not smart enough to do it as I am decent at maths and have heard it's quite tough (though I like it but never really was the topper or anything in it).

I have considered engineering (as is the norm). I did like comp sci., materials, ee as potential fields. I know most of engineering is designing machines and processes but I don't think I would enjoy it much.  hence I'm not sure I will like engineering as a whole. But the salary and job security is quite lucrative even though I might not be that interested in it as other subjects and tbh peer pressure also. I am not that confident about JEE and don't think I will get an iit esp cs but you never know.

Coming back to other fields, economics is what I'm leaning towards most. I am interested in it as it satisfies my itch of psychology and maths.  There are various fields here too not to mention switching to finance so quite versatile. Also liked Econ as job prospects are quite a lot: finance, govt, think tanks, data analysis etc. etc.

I would like to earn a decent salary but I also do not want to be poor. I do not really care that much about a high salary as long as I find the job interesting. I also don't have any particular preference to be in India so abroad isn't really an issue. My parents are open-minded and never forced me into anything. Financially middle-upper class. 

Apart from studies I like to read philosophy and debates. I've basically given a bio data at this point. I do feel I'm overthinking a bit but I don't wanna be like many people who end up hating their jobs...

Here is some background:

1. I have Japanese citizenship &amp; passport
2. I have USA citizenship &amp; passport
3. I have been working for an Indian company in Mumbai since 2016
4. In that time EPFO has been paid, will have a balance around 13L by the time I leave
5. Because I was living in the USA before I came to India, Indian government required that I apply for my visa through their embassy in the USA, and use my American passport as I had no legal standing to be in the USA as a JP citizen. HOWEVER, from the onset, and every following year when I renew my visa, they (Indian Gov/FRRO) have asked if I have dual nationality, to which my answer is always yes, and I fill in my Japanese passport details on the forms.

If you look at some analysis online ([E&amp;Y](https://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/people-advisory-services/hc-alert--india-japan-social-security-agreement-comes-into-force-with-effect-from-1-october-2016) and [MoEA](https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/27088/IndiaJapan_Social_Security_Agreement)) it's clear to me that as a citizen of Japan, I am entitled to withdraw these funds. However, my employer's EPFO is run as a trust (when I login to the UAN passbook website it says:

""*Passbook not available to this Member-id as this pertain to exempted establishment (i.e. Trust).Requested to contact your employer*""

My employer is a respected organization and does not want to run afoul of any impropriety. In their view, because my Indian employment visa is stamped in an American passport, I am an American citizen and not eligible for the SSA treaty. I think that this understandable, but a bit foolish, as I do not think corporations can overwrite the rights of citizens/international law, and as a citizen of Japan I am entitled to the benefits of this treaty.

Thoughts on how to proceed? I think that worst case scenario, I may be able to apply for withdrawal after 2 months of leaving the company as an unemployment withdrawal?

Should I just accept this as karma for all the social security deposits NRI's have made from their paychecks while on temporary postings in the USA? :D",,agk6zs,,0,,false,1552654649,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/agk6zs/epfo_weirdness_for_dualcitizen_foreigner_ssa/,,,false,AskIndia,

Hi r/india, I have had unprotected at a massage parlor. I don’t know what was going in my head and have been in constant worry since then.

Details : The massage parlor is in noida and they provide 45 mins massage for around Rs 800-1200. I went there yesterday. Had the massage and the masseuse agreed for sex at Rs2500 after much persuasion. I know how that sounds, but i needed it. When time came, she said she had no condom. Neither did I. I asked her if she is infected. She said no. She then asked me if I was. We then proceeded. 

I know that was so risky and foolish. The worry has been eating at me and I haven’t stopped thinking about the potential STDs(mainly HIV). I’ve read online about it and the the chances seem low. But I still can’t put my mind off it.

Someone please provide me with what are  my chances of getting infected. And if some thing can be done this early stage to prevent potential things? Or how my life seems if I am in fact infected.

I need your help here. Anyone, please give me some advice.

Edit: I(23 M) am a student and live in the NCR region. Can’t provide more details due to obvious reasons. I have never had unprotected sex before, not even with my ex. And certainly not going to do it with a stranger in future.

Edit 2: She didn’t look like she did this often and was also inexperienced.

Edit 3: Went to the doctor. He prescribed me darunavir and tenofovir. Took the first dose before 24 hrs from intercourse. Things seem good for now. I’ve learned my lesson and hope this ends here. Let’s see what the future entails.

2. I intend to leave the 401K account untouched until I turn 60 (or should I do a traditional IRA rollover?).

Questions:

1. Reading on the internet, I understand that I will need to report the 5% paper gains on my Indian tax return each year. But does that mean I also pay the Indian authorities taxes on the paper-gain amount each year? Or its just reporting but I don’t have to pay taxes on it?
2. At age 60 when I begin taking distributions from 401K/IRA, I am sure I will pay taxes to IRS in US but what will be my tax liability in India? Will I be paying Indian income taxes at that time as well?

I'll try to give it to the garbage truck today but my hopes are not high, they once refused to take thermocol and having no choice I had to dump it somewhere. I've seen the sanitation dept in my city and it looks like a heap of garbage itself which says a lot about the efficiency of the organisation.

Any other options? Thanks",,b3zghx,,0,,false,1560249738,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b3zghx/how_to_dispose_of_used_motor_oil/,,,false,AskIndia,

Edit: I just got back from work and yes it seems they might've had some poisoned food from one of the neighbours, I wanted to bury them but I didn't have the time and didn't know any empty lots around where I would be allowed to dig and sadly my house is just concrete and had no space for that so I had to put them in a dumpster, the dumpster is regularly emptied out so it wouldn't rot there and also there are two more cats still around the neighborhood so if they turn up dead as well, I will have a word with the neighbours and try to find who did it.

She is from a village in Haryana. We share a bathroom and she doesn't wash her hands with soap. I am pretty much a germaphobe and I constantly clean the bathtub and the sink with domestos. However, I can not go around disinfecting everything that she touches!
We've been roommates since September, and I spoke to her about this then. We bought a liquid soap and I though she would be washing her hands. When I left home and came back after 2 months, I saw that there was no soap (there was very little when I left) and basically yeah.
Also, in autumn she told me that she doesn't use toilet paper, but her English is so bad that she tried to explain something and then just changed the topic. So I guess she uses water to clean poop. Them I'm worried how she does it because we don't have a bidet. In the bathtub? Fuck, it's disgusting. But I don't even know how to ask that. Just tell her - hey do you wash your butt in the tub after defecating?
I simply can not explain to her that she has to wash her hands after pooping! She told me that in India they didnt even have water and my guess would be that they didnt even have a toilet. What do I do? I was thinking about simply confronting her and saying - ""hey you need to wash your hands, it's disgusting that you don't do it"". Another issue is that she has a tiny little piece of ayurvedic soap which she doesn't use at all, but she will claim she has soap and she uses it. 
Weirdly, she has all the shower stuff and takes bath regularly, but she doesn't wash her fucking hands!
Idk if it's a cultural thing but I don't care even if it is. It's basic hygiene rules. I just have no idea how to make her do that.

* Evaluation metric - Open Book Exam, Drop and take subjects
* Better connect with industry
* Teachers/professors
* Research Focused universities, grants, labs

Challenges

* Scarcity of competent teachers

Solutions

* For classes having less than 25 students, use recorded lectures and a projector. Hire a mediator for half the cost of a teacher who knows how to use a laptop and who can maintain decorum in the class.

The way it is explained is much intuitive and interesting that what we learn in any books, what we learn is to calculate stuff like a machine. We do not have any intuition about depth about what we are learning. Most of us believe while in school and college is that calculus is useless and most of the formulas are not required in everyday life. But maths is much more than that, it's everywhere. Maths is a tool to understand other things. No one taught us that from that perspective.

I was a prodigy in ""failing"" since childhood. I never won at anything. I never improved at anything. For example, if I am playing counter strike more I practice and play more worse I get. Simple instructions are hard to follow. I can't even shave. I inherited this prodigious talent from my paternal grandparents who were poor and imbeciles. They basically were 2 year olds in dressed in adults. 

Whenever, i try to improve I fail! I can't improve at anything. I want to succeed at suicide. I think my parents were dumb, so they breed and had me to share their dumbness with! I don't know why low intelligence (IQ) people are allowed to breed. Not having intelligence is worse thing. 

Many can argue that hardwork, dedication and motivation can help. Everything in the world has exceptions. So some low IQ people succeed in business i.e. low IQ business. They make wealth,but not that much. Look at bill gates,Elon musk, Steve Ballmer and other people. They had high IQ. They went to best universities. Their parents were smart. They inherited their smartness. Life is unfair. They were also at the right place at right time. I envy high IQ. I also look up at serial killers who had high IQs . Edmund Kemper(145), Joel Rifkind(130),Manson(121) and domestic terrorist Ted kaczynski(167). These people are sitting in prisons. I would like to have their brains. Their intelligence. My MBA exams are there in 10 days and I can't solve simple logical puzzles,critical reasoning and date interpretation. If I had their intelligence,  I will definitely succeed. I wish I had problem solving skills. I am crying every minute. I am just sitting here in a room, talking to myself ""if I had high IQ"". I know people will say high IQ is nothing, but it's bullshit. You know all people who go to Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge or people who made inventions, propounded theories/ maths had high IQs. Now I realise how world works!

IQ of 145-160= geniuses ( these people go to ivy league schools and if they are psychopaths they become billionaires)
IQ of 130-140= gifted ( these people also with a little bit of effort go to top colleges and earn much more)
120= above average ( these people with hard work can go to above average University)
100= average ( this is the most complicated one,they all think they are geniuses or above average. They are perfect customers for high IQ ones and slaves of them. They are born to be a part of herd mentality. Believe in everything they see without questioning. They always brag about hardwork, motivation and blah blah! 
Below average= THIS IS WHERE I BELONG
 These people can't function as an adult. They are extremely impulsive. If they have 
Genetic predisposition towards violence+ abusive childhood they can become serial killers
These people can't follow simple instructions. They are extremely religious. They think of God. They are often manipulated by the system. 
Example= Joe arridy, a mentally retarded man with an imbecile IQ below 50, was falsely charged for murder of an little girl. He didn't knew he was about to be executed. He spent time playing with trains while in prison. On the day of execution, he gave his train to his pen pal . He was excecuted. Afterwards, police found out he was innocent. 

See world is ruled by High IQ individuals. They kill everyone for their greed. They are better are everything. People who say they have high IQ and still poor or dropouts are lazy. 
 Sorry if I was offensive these are just thoughts.
 Is there hope, I don't see any other than waiting for next life! 
I don't want anything to do with anyone my family, friends and the world. I want to be left alone and die in peace. I don't want money, fame, good life for my family. I just want to be abandoned. I deserve it. I just want to be disappear. Even after I die I don't want my body to be found. I want my exeistence to be erased. Even if my parents die, I don't care.

Are there any people on reddit who come from political, business families who are aware of the dark secrets, what do they think about it? All of us love to take upright stand on issues like lynching, black money, corruption as long as we're not part of it. 

I have a couple of friends whose families have been thriving off  black money only. Not paid single ₹ as income tax but own houses worth 4-5 crores. I never pressed them to opine on it because things would get awkward between us. But I have tried to casually extract their stand on this issue. It goes something like 'its okay to not pay tax, it's not moral crime. It's just money hidden from govt records. You need to do something to provide to your family. Not everyone is qualified like you'. I find it totally illogical. But they ride the moral horse high when voicing your opinion against one such thing is trendy. 

For instance, plastic is banned in Maharashtra. I was sipping tender coconut with one of these friends. He was quick to say 'plastic is banned' looking at plastic straw. I was quicker to respond, 'you know what else is banned? Black bucks!' He took it as a joke and we forgot about it. 

I have joined an NGO recently. The volunteers' head hails from a family who own businesses in bhindi bazar.( For those who don't know, it's an open secret that markets in South Mumbai are hub of black money) I wonder what he would have to say if I ever ask him for his thoughts. 

Generally, people don't want to accept their hypocrisy or irony. I'm sure there must be people from such families on reddit. Why are good acts limited to appreciation? When will we start the change from ourselves?

I find it baffling to see a lot of South Indians on Social Media vociferously supporting RSS. In a Hindi-Hindu Rastra they are ethnic minorities with second class status. And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India than they are towards non-Hindus. Which begs the question, why is there even a single South Indian Bhakt?

Because I understand that most people like to think of themselves as ""different"" or ""weird"" these days, and while there's nothing wrong with that, I personally have a very specific definition/understanding of this word that I *feel* makes more sense given the definition of the term ""misfit"".  

So, in my opinion/understanding, a misfit is a person that is SO DIFFERENT that most of the world has no real place for them. These people may or may not find friends, mostly the latter case. If they find friends at all, these people are also ""loners"" or people deemed too ""weird"" by the rest of the world. But in more cases or not, these people CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD BY ANYONE BUT THEMSELVES. These people mostly struggle to understand their place in the world, wondering every single day what the F they are even doing here. They are unable to find their place amidst humanity, and often feel like an utter alien. Their thoughts are nothing like ""normal"" people. Their emotions are nothing like ""normal"" people. And most importantly their behaviours are NOTHING LIKE those of the majority of humanity surrounding them. They are mostly alone, and people mostly avoid them because their presence makes everyone uncomfortable --- and it's not because of bad hygiene or loud, irritating behaviour; but its simply because nobody can relate to them.  

P.S. If you pursued the same education as everyone else, have the same habits as everyone else, watch the same TV shows and read the same books as everyone else and you already have your own MASSIVE group of different (*""rebel""*) folks; chances are that NOT not a *""misfit.""* Not because I'm gatekeeping here, but because you've already found a group where you ""fit in"" perfectly well.

""Where is your native place""

""Where are you from?""

These are common questions but I have no answer to it. I grew up in a different country, had my schooling in a different city, have my parents from two different parts of Kerala and have my (recently) permanent address in a different city.

I could say I am from the city I live in and have my family home in, but I've not lived here more than a year and know nothing about it. I could say I'm from the city I was born in , but again, I know nothing about it. When festivals happen here, I see them for the first time. I don't have any local friends.

I could say I am from the metropolis that I spent the largest chunk of my life in but then I am not Kannadiga.

I could say I am from the foreign country I grew up in and had my childhood from but then LOL that country doesn't give anybody citizenship. And I don't want it even if they paid me for it.

The more I think about it, the stranger the question of where you're from becomes, if you, like me, have no fixed roots. Where are you from if your parents come from two different cities? Where are you from if you spent many years in Bangalore but feel no affiliation to one city over another? Where are you from if you don't speak the local dialect and language of the place you are from?

inb4 ""I am from India"" because using that in a conversation is going to get you significant eyeroll. That only works on passport officers.

At the same time, I'm worried he'll actually end up finding me someone from another country, because he's tenacious like that. If that happens, I'm scared that I'll actually be impressed at him and end up agreeing to marriage before I can fully comprehend whatever the fuck just happened.

On the other hand, this statement might open up an entirely new can of worms where my parents will start extolling the virtues of marrying within one's community. Apparently an astrologer my family has known for decades has predicted that my brother will marry a ""gori mem"" (sic) and my parents believe what he says, so I do have some cause for concern.

**NOTE:** Needless to say, I am only looking at this as a tactic to get my parents off my case.

On some days, I feel charged up and have a strong desire of learning new things especially topics related to Finance.

I've stopped talking to these people regularly now who used to take me for granted in office and they are surprised at my behavior because I don't satisfy their external validation.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have failed a professional exam in the final stage for 3-4 attempts due to lack of focus on studies. I have ruined my career and had decided to move on with a job rather than lingering on with that course. But again my sudden desire to learn and make a good career made me dive into preparing for this exam and burned out in few days of deciding.

&amp;#x200B;

 Off late I managed my depression through body weight exercises and swimming. Cleaned my diet, lost a lot of weight and toned a bit of muscles in this process. Started r/nofap because I was badly addicted and have a belief in nofap. On my 80+ day streak right now,

Maybe I need to indulge in some spiritual things to calm my mind. But on some days, I have complete control over my mind. I tried living a life with Nihilistic and Stoic mindset but my fickle-mind just doesn't know what it wants.

Tl;dr. I am trying to counter depression but struggling to stay consistent and I feel I don't have a future with this lifestyle.

Happy new year!

I was wondering what other fellow fountain pen users on here use for paper. Rhodia, Clairefontaine are available but way too expensive for daily note taking and general school use.

I am currently using Classmate notebooks as daily driver, however, they tend to bleed through with Diamine Sargasso Sea in a Metropolitan Fine. However, I have had no issues with it whatsoever with other pen/inks I have used.

For nicer writing, I use Lotus ruled sheets that come in pack of 20 for ₹40. They are great, probably the best paper I have written with. But they have higher weight, and not ideal for daily use. Even for filing, it's too heavy.

I have a ream of JK Excel Bond 90gsm but paper isn't smooth. It's ink resistant, but coarse. And I don't get much shading on it, neither sheen.

Classmate for now offers a great combo, but they don't make journals. They are okay for schoolwork. Ink shades nicely on it though. No sheen again.

I also tried Papercoal Notebook Two from Amazon, they go for ₹295 for 160 pages. It's 90gsm but absorbs ink like a tissue. So again, not ideal.

JK Cedar seems to be well reviewed but at 100gsm, it's again thick for filing purposes, and isn't available locally.

I tried Luxor Ring notebooks as well, ink feathers on it like crazy.

At last, I have a practical notebook lying around, made by 'Evergreen'. I was pleasantly surprised to see the sheen of Sargasso Sea and Diamine Sherwood Green on it. Pleasant experience.

So, I am looking for fairly ink resistant paper that isn't too heavy. So maybe I can buy a bunch of it and get it binded. And I am looking for a journal, so I can use it for bullet journaling or maybe as a diary.

Thanks everyone!

Tldr; I need good paper suggestions.

So it probably is going to be a long but the story starts from here...

My mother has been married to my father for 27 years and we live in India.

My father has been has always mentally and emotionally abused (though never physically) my mother since their marriage.

He never gave my mother freedom to live by her choice and never provided her with any kind of money. He always threw tantrums and always fought with my mother when she wanted to visit her sisters, her mother or even any of her friends. He never paid for the interior design of our house. It was all done by my mother.

Even though giving minimal amount of money for groceries, he never bought my mother anything and my mom had always had to beg for the essentials of the house. She started her own interior design freelance after that.

It was all mental torture for my mother until she decided to cut off from my dad permanently 3-4 years ago when my father started asking money from my mom because she was earning well.

As we live in India it is very difficult even talking about divorce.

As me and my brother got older(both 20 &amp; 25) we understood more and more about the struggles of our mom.

My father cut off paying for bills 3-4 years ago and only pays electricity, maintenance bill of the home and the mortgage of the house.

All other bill payment responsibilities fell on my mother's shoulders and she is now struggling month by month to pay it.

My father gave me money monthly for my college and my education fees until yesterday when he threw dry waste on my mom because my mom picked up alcohol bottle from the dustbin and kept it on his table ( yeah he drinks everyday).

I confronted him about this and we had this huge fight.

Today he has cut off my monthly travel expenses and threatened to cut off everything. He debited everything from the account.

What can I do? What is the way forward for my mother, brother (earns decently through job but still not that much to be independent) and me?",,ass1li,,0,,false,1553225416,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/ass1li/mentally_abusive_father_has_stopped_giving_money/,,,false,AskIndia,

My choices so far:

1. Bhutan (Paro and Thimu)
2. Meghalaya
3. Dharamshala

I have not done anything physically exerting for a long time, so, don't want to do on long treks - a lot of walking at the place is completely okay. Also, I'd rather stay in a hotel than a tent or campsite.

I need the place to have good flight connectivity with Mumbai or Delhi as I do not want to waste a lot of time in train. 4-5 hours away from an airport is fine.

What I'm really interested in are recommendations for good hostels/hotels where lots of solo travelers stay together and which fosters camaraderie amongst the guests (with thing like group dinner or parties). I can also consider travel packages which bring together solo travelers.

I am a 26 years old freelance developer from hyderabad. I am currently stuck in a tight situation which I feel might convert into a legal issue, yesterday i received an email from one of the partners of a retail startup for which i was developing a website until last year requesting to pay back 50% of the project amount else action would be taken. Due to constant changes from client's end the project failed. Since one of the partners was a close friend and I was new to legal side of freelancing, there was no contract signed apart from non-disclosure agreement and everything else was done via emails.

&amp;#x200B;

Email that i received yesterday:

 \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear xxxxx,

This is with reference to your engagement for the development of our website www.xxxxx.com. While we engaged your services on the basis of your projection of being capable enough to develop the website, at the end of nearly 8 months, we were left with a half baked, non functional product that was of no use to us, nor could have ever been useful given the manner that it lacked basics required in any E-Commerce platform. This has not just resulted in the project being considerably delayed by also in losses due to not being able to transact. 

While we understand that you put in considerable effort, there was a huge gap in your capability and experience to implement one. We kindly request you to return 50%of the amount paid to you since we did not get what was supposed to be delivered, nor could we continue any further or get any support for the subsequent year as was discussed. 

Request you to do the needful by the 15th of February, post which we might consider taking action as we deem fit to ensure the right remedy. 

Warm regards, 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

background of the project and timelapse:

Around july 2017  I was referred by one of my clients to a project in which he was a partner,they wanted an e-commerce website. I presented my quote and was selected for the project. They mentioned initially they had only 4 types of products and each product's way of calculation was different (some needed to be sold via fixed stock, some would be sold via size in ft/meters etc). and they wanted to have an android app in future aswell, given the complex requirement i proposed to build the website in laravel framework instead of using a CMS like wordpress, and the database could also be used for the android app they built in future.  


They agreed and left it to me to decide on the matter (since they did not have the knowledge regarding the same). after few weeks the project was stuck because the client was in the process of creating a registered bank account for his company which was needed for payumoney (which was one of the payment providers to be used on the site, other being paypal for international customers), but the client was rejected by couple of banks and the project was stalled indefinitely.  


After about 2 months they resumed after they had setup their bank account and had finally setup the payumoney account which then allowed us to use their API. hence i integrated it in the application.

&amp;#x200B;

In the mean time I had created different product pages based on the product type (and their calculation methods and other features like image cropping and recording the cropped co-ordinate positions)

  
After which the client started providing textual content and other content for the site (which were added and cross checked by them aswell). then I was stuck with the application due to one of the requirements which was to forward the customers based on their country to either .com or .in domain, and show different prices based on the country. It took some time but was eventually implemented.

&amp;#x200B;

After which the client said to change  one of the product's calculation methods because they don't sell it in fixed quantity rolls but custom sizes, i did not request for additional charges here and implemented the same and also provided a video walk though for the same.

&amp;#x200B;

In the subsequent weeks, client started asking and modifying other things on the site similarly (and i did not ask for additional charges again).  


\* redesigning home page over 4 times and loading its data dynamically

\* photoshop work for images

\* feature modifications and others

&amp;#x200B;

At one point where the product types reached 7. I asked the client to pay additional amount for any more types that were going to be added there after, the client agreed and paid for the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Then when the website was in final stages there were a few bugs which were being mitigated, the client asked for design changes(which was explicitly mentioned by me in the specification email itself that design can either be purchased from envato or you can hire someone with approx cost, they went ahead with an envato html design). and also a dynamic cart(cart details via ajax) and coupon functionality was requested. I had implemented the coupon functionality but for the dynamic cart i asked them to hire another freelancer for dynamic cart functionality since i did not get enough time due to other commitments. The client was also not happy with the project and wanted me to exit from the project, hence i suggested that i would act as consultant and provide advice and support if required.  

&amp;#x200B;

Along with the person who was the point of contact (who represented them) we posted the requirements on [freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com) and got a freelancing team to work on mobile menu design functionality and dynamic cart. I provided assistance and ideas on how to implement it. The freelancer implemented it, then problems started occurring overall on the website due to complexities issues that were introduced due to the dynamic cart functionality(add to cart and remove cart item functionality and guest cart system), I tried my best to fix those and fixed it to a certain extent. In the mean time the client proceeded to do campaigns and other activities to drive traffic on the site. But sales were not being generated. 

And the client kept on consistently blaming the website for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The client then approached a digital marketer  who found a few more bugs and website design issues, the client approached back to me to fix the bugs aswell and design changes, I was stuck in a tight spot and fixed the bug aswell as added the design changes aswell, similarly couple of more bugs were found, and i fixed them aswell, then during one of the conversations client started asking me to add more functionalities to the site which i rejected and we had a heated discussion(between one of the partner and me) and i didnt want to continue with them any longer (my friend who had referred me to this project also suggested me to exit the project aswell). This happened around june-july in 2018

&amp;#x200B;

They went ahead with the digital marketer whose company also provided magento development services and developed the site from scratch in magento but none of the custom and complex functionalities which were there in the laravel site that I had developed.

&amp;#x200B;

During their development, they sought my help with regards to amazon s3 storage setup and hosting issues which i assisted them with for free of cost.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple of weeks back I was contacted by the clients side again as their current developer had issues implementing some of the features which there in the old website. but since i didnt have any experience with magento and i didnt want to do anymore work for them i had rejected the same.

&amp;#x200B;

And yesterday i got that email.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I am quite afraid as i don't have any idea how to handle this legally, and i don't have any funds either. due to the time investment i had done in this project i lost alot of revenue from other sources hence i was in very bad state financially. now that i had started to level, this problem arised.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would really be appreciated.

I was in a messed up situation 3-4 years ago which affected my grades significantly, the effect of which I'm facing now.  My CV isn't impressive enough but I've come to terms with it and have decided to put regrets aside and worked hard against every circumstances(or at least tried to) for the past 1-2 years.

During this past year or so, I developed my skill set and taught myself Python, R, SQL among few other stuffs which I can't boast off though. As suggested by some others I've also picked up two projects but I doubt if they'll be completed before I graduate.

So coming to the point now is that I need a job. LinkedIn or Naukri(scams most of the time) hasn't proved much for me since all I see there are job postings for people with ""experience"". I'm lost, hopeless and there's no confidence left in me so as a fresher, right out of college I'm in dire need of some expert advice on what/where/how exactly should I be looking for a job.

The implementation of website is really amateurish. I mean I can book an airline ticket without even registering a profile.

I don't want to belittle the developers. Have these developers seen a booking website before? Whoever was tasked to build the website had done a terrible job. It is one of the worst website I have used so far.

When asked anyone Indian railways, most of them are proud of  the fact that it's one of largest railways in the worlde. Whats the point when simple things such as website is not even working properly.

I am not sure if it just me or everyone else have the same experience.

The vast majority of articles are in English (5 million +). The second closest is Espanol with 1.6 million. It leads to reason that most of the internet exists in English or at the very least in the Latin alphabet.

What's life like when you can only read in Hindi? For example, on [NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-strikes-terrorist-camp-across-line-of-control-say-reports-official-details-awaited-1999291), in a field of English you can see one small link allowing you to read the article in Hindi. Are you more prone to using websites that have Hindi translation options?

What are the differences between accessing the web in Hindi than in English? For example, I imagine Dainik Jagran shows up as a news source much before anything else, right? Because as an English reader, I don't see Dainik Jagran at all on my Google search results for news - unless I'm searching for local news in the Hindi belt. 

I imagine that most Indian internet users today are accessing in languages not English. Was just curious as to the experience. It must mean a totally different site-set than us english users, but it can also mean that the experience is different as well. Do you feel forced to use English websites or does Google translate function effectively? And do people have the Google translate extension enabled by default all the time?

Just curious for personal insights into another world. Non-English internet users would by far be the majority in India so it's interesting to consider as a research topic.

Compare that to previous pack which was totalling 153 with 100+ channels, this is a massive stinky BULLSHIT.

I'm much better than what I was a year ago

The problem is,I still don't feel  comfortable in my skin. I never went to classes in my first year  out of anxiety and mild depression and got poor grades. Now in the next year,I don't feel as  anxious, relatively calm,I'm not sure if the depression is still  there,but It's relatively easy for me to pull off normal days. And my  grades have only gotten worse,I still don't have any motivation. Going  bald young is psychologically exhausting. No amount of validation seems  to do it for me. Sometimes I go read old threads on askwomen that I've  already read 10 times and get reminded that the general opinion is that  being bald is unattractive, especially for young women,along with a  bunch of ""Bald is better than balding or combover"" to make you feel  good,but it doesn't help because being attractive by having hair is  still not an option. All of this combined with cultural stigma in my  country,and being in a major with a very skewed gender ratio means any  prospect of relations or even platonic girlfriend seems hopeless to me.

I'd  still like to assert that my mental health has improved if only a  bit,maybe today is just a bad day and I felt like ranting. Maybe all  that I said is just another process of ""catastrophization"" where I jump  to conclusions based on a few setbacks. But I honestly can't practically  see how it all works out for me. I'd still love some general advice or  talk with anyone who went or knows anyone who went through the same,or  just anyone from India,or women. But,I've done that a bunch of times,and  yet I'm here, going a few days completely numb trying to fill the void  with mostly looking for validation,games,music and TV Shows(No,I'm not addicted,I can stop them easily,but it helps keep my mind occupied) with  an occasional day like this where I feel the need to express for a  moment of catharsis and tear up because it still feels good to be sad  sometimes

PS.  Before anyone asks,I get sides from both minoxidil and  finasteride,whether that be in my head or not. Besides,I don't want to  deal with this any more.

PS2. People who want to suggest applying onion or egg on my head can go left. People who want to suggest gym,thanks,I have started and I'll probably somewhat fit,nothing of note though,because I'm a vegetarian and have moderate protein(and food) intake

Should I stop watching porn?,"It's a simple, half-silly/half-serious question to ask, but the longer I think about or try to justify it, the more frightening it becomes. Here's my rationale:

I was formerly with a private ISP. Shifted to BSNL for their fiber line - faster speeds at a lower price. I also believed that they could not be less reliable than the previous ISP (Asianet) with whom I had a terrible experience.

However, I have since realized that I only really need high speeds for high porns. I mean, when you've got that instant gratification 4K thunder thighs triple-extravaganza on call... how can you resist? But that turns out to be a Catch 22, for me.

While the govt might need a warrant or some interest in me in order to request my browsing history from an ISP, their own company's servers have no reason not to log my every request. What stops BSNL from logging every one of their users? What do we know about their privacy and security (what we do know [isn't very good](https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/a-study-of-the-privacy-policies-of-indian-service-providers-and-the-43a-rules) )? 

So what, I hear you say, it's not a worry because I don't watch anything illegal? [The nothing to hide argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument#For_privacy) is an absurd proposition in the first place, and falls flat when you consider that some Sarkari Babu can bring up your naughty nautanki, and in the public domain, given our judgemental-asylum culture. 

I have no beef with the govt now and they have no beef with me, but should we have beef together someday, should I expect some NSFW Kompromat courtesy BSNL servers? Should I worry that I opened an article on Oommen Chandy just before (or during - I have severe ADHD) a steamy session - allowing them to put 2 and 2 together to make the point that I fap to Chandy?

Please don't suggest paid VPNs to me as I am broke. I don't care how you divide up or rationalize the financing of it I cannot afford it and I don't want to pay money to fap it goes against my atma.

Literally no one is exempt from this phenomenon - rickshaws tuck themselves in everywhere, bikes try to slip between vehicles, almost all car owners leave little to no space between consecutive vehicles.

No one seems to grasp the concept of staying in their own lane, if people were caught breaking the signal or speeding above the allowed limit everyone would get stopped one by one - it's just a crazy shit show. I have had several occasions where I had to personally point out to the traffic police themselves that vehicles are breaking the red light while I was crossing the road. Am I really expected to be okay with this?

You can say that many youngsters are to blame, but I don't see any elder people following a lot of rules either. It's only when someone goes through a major accident themselves, even after which they will follow only certain rules selectively so as to avoid harm to self.

I am looking for a more constructive answer than 'Because you can bribe the traffic police' I am also not looking forward to any of those 'You need to man up' bs comments.

SCAMmed by the e-commerce outlet veerzaara.in! Additionally read the post down below (if you can spare the time),"TLDR: Reeled in by a flashy Facebook ad, my mother ordered 2 designer gowns only to be shipped TORN, SECOND HAND SAREES. The ""post sales support"" is unresponsive. Based on online reviews, this is the MO of this scam. Your valuable suggestions (including regarding cross-posting) are welcome to help her claim her refund and also to bring these scamming bast*rds (excuse my french) to justice.

My mother having been reeled in by a flashy UI and huge discounts (upwards of 90%) on designer gowns ordered 2 of them on a COD basis from the seller veerzaara.in. Although the discounts did make her a bit skeptical, she came across the ad for this store on Facebook and mistook that for a proof of credibility.
The package arrived yesterday as promised through SpeedPost and the delivery process was supported by SMS notifications and a tracking facility. All of these ""features"" meant that her skepticism slowly made way for excitement and anticipation.
Upon the delivery by the postman, she demanded that she inspect the contents before making the payment. However, despite an argument explaining her stand, the postman denied her this claiming the act to be against the policies. She made the payment and to her horror found SECOND HAND, TORN SAREES INSTEAD OF THE PROMISED DESIGNER GOWNS in the package.
She tried contacting the support for a refund or replacement only to find it unresponsive. She then brought this to my notice.
A simple Google search later (admittedly something that she should have done in the first place), this e-commerce website VEERZAARA.IN was revealed as a scam to me.

1) I made her report the ad to Facebook to avoid other people befalling her fate but I doubt if it will be removed

2) Since this package was delivered on Saturday (6/1/19) evening, I shall enquire of the postmaster on Monday if the package can be returned.

3) My family's experience with the consumer forum has been a very sour one. Even though it was just one incident about 10 years back when I had just entered my teens, this avenue also doesn't seem promising.

My mother seems to have lost all hope and has chalked it up to bad debt.
I'm lost for ideas and thus am posting here.

Using this argument, I believe it should be the mother's name that should act as a valid proof of identification. That is not the norm (at least in India, from what I've observed). Any reasons why?

He started blackmailing her with photographs (I don't know what photographs) tortured her and her family by calling and blackmailing. She's not even telling me clearly what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Her father got brain hemorrhage after this and she thinks it's because of her. She is blaming herself and I don't know how I could help her. Her father is in a serious condition and require good doctors but they don't have the money and neither do I. I have a very poor salary and I could manage only a few thousands to help her which is not enough. They are in a very bad condition.

&amp;#x200B;

Please please please tell me how I can help her. I fear i will lose a friend if she breaks and do something bad to herself. Please save my friend and her dad.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry if it all sounds all cliche but I will destroy that man's life. He's probably out there hurting some other girl. I need advice on how would I do it (Please don't recommend the police because we all know they will do nothing). That guy is a business owner and I want ways to destroy his business, his life. I want to make sure he cries for eternity for what he did to my friend.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so so sorry if it feels like I am going to do something wrong and there must be another way but ""Aise cases phle se hote aa rahe hain aur hamesha hote rhenge - if we don't do something about it ourselves"".

&amp;#x200B;

Please if you help me now I will make it my life's motto to help people in such situations and make sure these cowards who hit women are not able to procreate.

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice where do I bring the money to treat her dad in a good hospital. Maybe I need a better paying job, I have 2 years of experience on ReactJS, React Native, NodeJS, AWS and I still earn just 15k a month which barely covers my expenses. I would even learn Hacking to destroy his business.  I would even learn fighting to beat the shit out of that guy. I wasn't changing my job because I was studying to go for an MS next year but now all these things are happening.  I don't know what to do.

 What should I do, how the fuck should I murder (hypothetically) this guy legally. I don't want any fights and such , I just want him to leave her be.

HELP ME.



Edit:- Thank you all of you for your suggestions and advice , thankfully the situation has been solved, he did gave her a push the other day but did not hit her, me and my mom talked to him, we had a long conversation and he said that he is extremely sorry and he wont ever talk to her or stalk her or do anything that would cause her trouble. He said he aint a gunda or a rakshash etc and now we all are relived af.



What happend that day- So as usual the guy must be stalking my sister and when he saw my sister driving her moped with her male best friend sitting behind her(she was driving him to his place after college) he got mad and stopped them with his bike, started his usual drama he was very angry and my sister was terrified by his temper and anger, he also hit my sister's moped. My sister's male best friend tried to talk some sense in him but the ex got heat up on him too, so the bff called his friends telling them that my sister's ex is back again causing drama ( he has caused drama in her college in front of her friends before too twice). Then again the male friend and the ex started arguing and my sister came in between them but the ex pushed her away, the friends who were on there way saw him pushing her on the road with the public watching the drama, they got very angry and as soon as they got off their bike they slapped and kicked the ex couple of times, the ex let them hit him and did not resist it (He said he too the beating for her) my sister friends told her to go home and not to worry about her ex. Now when all this happend I was at home, 18 kms away, so I took my mom with me and when I was on the way my sister called me and told me to wait so we waited and she told me all about her shitty day, my mom called her ex and then we had the long conversation and now It's all okay, he said sorry to all of us and his friends too.

Background: I'm in my mid 20s and hold a Masters degree in physics. Just graduated last year and unemployed right now.

Current scenario : I am the type of person who was very interested in research until December last year, but now I am really thinking hard about my career options. I have attempted NET which was conducted in December 2018. My prospects of getting through this exam is bleak. While contemplating about life and what I want from it, I came to a startling discovery that I cannot afford to spend the rest of my life dedicated to research in any fields of physics. I'm late in this realization because I'm not the wisest of the bunch and extremely stubborn hence the delay. 

I am planning (just a draft plan) to branch out to Data Analysis, I'm fairly proficient in Statistics, python and MATLAB. Taken into consideration that I might require some more months to actually learn something relevant to the field, get down to projects etc and that I already have a gap of almost 9 months, what are the prospects that I could be recruited in the next 3 months or so? I believe my chances are slim due to the amount of gap time, but would appreciate some insights from whoever reads this. I really need some good cognizance on whether this is a feasible path or not.

Thank you in Advance! :)

It's such a natural thing which everyone has the desire to indulge in. Why can't the older folks understand this.

Since majority of us are not encouraged to talk to the other gender or talk about sex, creepy behaviour ensues because people can't hold a conversation with the other gender and their hidden desire for sex (which can't be expressed openly) leads to it.

I'm 17 [M). I live in Kolkata. When I was 6 months old I was diagnosed with an extremely rare deseas. The doctors also gave me a wrong treatment (Institute of Child Health Care Center of Kolkata). I *somehow* survived. But it had a big effect on my eyes and internal organs. I got severe dry eyes, extreme photo phobia and low monocular vision (65% in the right eye and 5% in my left eye. Left eye is useless for me).

No school wanted to admit me because I had to take a drop every hour and nobody would do that for me. So my parents left me in a blind hostel when I was 5 (Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys Academy).

Fast forward to 12. I came back home to study with generals. I always knew I couldn't get a good future there so I kind of forced my mom (I have no dad) to bring me back home. My eye condition improved slightly. It was very hard. I still can't see the board. Vision fluctuation creates many problems etc.

Now when my peers asked me about my past institution, I always told them the name but omitted the part, ""Blind Boys Academy"".

I thought it would be really uncool and I was getting enough teased already. Let's be real here, around that age most boys goal is to be cool and get a girl friend. I failed in both miserably though.


Now that I'm slowly getting older, I'm trying to figure out how long am I going to hide this from others. One day or the other people will find out anyway. I have pretty big signs of my ""disability"". I have to wear caps all the time outside, I have to be close to the book to read it, I can't open my eyes properly or I can't play certain sports like Cricket etc.

But I'm afraid what kind of impact it would have on people knowing that I went to a blind school. I'm always embarrassed about something I have no control of, should I be?

I had hired an electrician, he has worked to put pipes and conceal space in the wall. It had been over a month that he said that he'd pull out wires from pipes. Now, when I contacted him repeatedly about when he is going to finish the work, he bailed and said ""why are you contacting me often? Don't call me again. I don't wont to finish your work."" Then one day he came to my place and counted electric points and gave me Rs 9550 bill. I had already paid him Rs 5000.

I, then, consulted three other electricians for opinion and they said this bill calculation is fake. He doesn't have anything to do with 1.5 sq mm or 2.5 sq mm wire. The only work he has done is to put concealed pipes, and that is worth 5000 and you have paid 5000, so there is nothing to give or take.

Now, he is threatening me to give him money which I don't owe him and asking me I must not do any electric work in my house without clearing his money or else he will beat me up. ( I have all conversations in call recordings )

When I ask other electricians to do the job they are asking if I have cleared everything with the old electrician. This is sort of their code of conduct, I believe. Now old electrician has fake bill which I don't owe him. 

Please advice, what is the best way out of the situation.

Typical Strict Asian parents focusing on comparisons from ""the neighbourhood scholar"" ( because everyone has one).

Luckily I myself like engineering, so yeah the only viable option: JEE then IIT

&amp;#x200B;

My school life was a piece of cake. 90% all-way till the 9th grade.

Then 10th grade came. And I am TERRIBLE in *ratta and pass*

So I only did the logical thing: Understand and write in my *own words. What* ***I understood.***

Guess examiners didn't like that : 70%

&amp;#x200B;

Distraught, but got a scholarship in a neighbouring coaching class.

Joined and became a part of the herd. The robots prepared to learn the formulas and don't care whether I understand or not.

Focused on one thing: Solving problems. Millions till you either suicide or pass JEE.

But I just couldn't stand it.

1.)Was from State Board so had to cover up to atleast CBSE (Whereas my batch mates were from *IB* or *IGCSE/ICSE)*

2)I liked CS, but I didn't sign up for engineering for Rosermund reactions and how to get area under  some random cures.

&amp;#x200B;

But still, I liked it. As it kinda tested whether *I knew something* or not.

&amp;#x200B;

But then came the \*12th Boards\*

And I know I have fucked them up. Badly.

I may pass, I can't guarantee that. I just cannot seem to memorize the answers. I get blank hen I attempt them. Partly because of the stress of my poor 10th grade.

&amp;#x200B;

And now I tell you what I already am:

1. Since I was 14 I learnt C/ C++ . Not forced by parents to,but because I loved to.
2. Progressed myself to self-learning. edx and MOOC's are *my way to learn.*
3. Finished CS50, which even my friends from engineering couldn't.
4. Have a knowledge of Web development, did some gigs on Freelance too.
5. Launched a startup, kinda succeeded but then closed down because I had to study.

&amp;#x200B;

But I guess universities don't want students with passion to learn the subject.

So guys, what should I do.

Take a drop/gap year, somehow manage myself to a college, spend 4 years and learn what I already know?

or is there any other way.

I know my parents will be shocked with my results. But I'm just messed up and confused.",,awsu7c,,0,,false,1560121406,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,universe,false,true,,/r/india/comments/awsu7c/help_i_guess_i_fucked_upbadly/,,Universe,false,AskIndia,

Background: Not originally from Bangalore, but working here for a while and staying near Marathahalli. I don't have any friends (who can teach me bike). I am an introvert with anxiety issues

The fact that I am 25+ (Male) and yet don't know how to ride a bike has been affecting me terribly to the point it is making me anxious (I even dream about it regularly). My social life is fucked up, people at my home, friends, girls somehow have low regard for me because of this

I tried a two wheeler driving school a while back. But thanks to me anxiety, introversion and terrible service of that school, I gave up on the 3rd day. Because of these reasons, I am not comfortable at all with the idea of enrolling in a school where most trainers don't give a fuck and are judgmental

Can any one of you be kind enough to teach me (riding in traffic, uphill, downhill etc) or suggest me a way to find someone who can genuinely (and personally) teach me how to ride a bike? I know how to ride a scooty (but can't ride with a pillion)

I am willing to pay twice or thrice more than what the schools usually charge. The offer of money is to show how important it is me and not to show that I can afford spending large amount

TL; DR, I need someone like an older brother who can teach me how to ride a bike for which I am willing to pay handsomely",,aw6b93,,0,,false,1560109908,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/aw6b93/can_anyone_teach_me_how_to_ride_a_bike_in/,,,false,AskIndia,

I am not a Hindi supporter or any other local language ( as a common language ).I also think as a nation to  keep contacted to each other we need to have a common language , and I think English is best choice for that common language because it's foreign to every state so everyone has to learn it and no one is at advantage.

But I just had a thought that what if we have not used English as a common language? And I personally think in India we are forgetting our local languages, and even some people think themselves as superior to others just because of the language ( funny and sad at same time) , and look down upon someone who doesn't know english.
And also as literature itself I also find myself forgetting vocabulary in my local language, not able to write it properly, and this thought came to me when I want to purchase a Novel which is translated from a different language to English and in my local language both , but I pick the English version. So this made me thinking about my relationship with my local language.
Now I am not good in both the languages ����

Edit : 
I am not hating english.
I am not blaming english for that, I am saying that it's hard in my environment for me and many others like me.
I  don't think about losing the language until recently and that's what I share in this post , I am not saying that I am doing some efforts but still not  able save my local language or anything like that.

I was saying because of the environment I am so out of touch with the language (local) that I can't read a novel in it and I don't even realized it.
I am not saying it is good or bad , I am just sharing the experience.

Edit : Many of you pointing out that I pick English version is my Choice , I know it's my choice but my point is not that with it , I am trying say that because English is more easier for me than my local language , which show the distance between Me and My local language , because like say School or the environment. ofcourse I can understand my language but it's more like what we speak as our daily language which has slangs and english mix , and not the bookish language which required you to have a decent Vocabulary knowledge.

AND I don't think I am alone who finds himself/herself in this position where it's  difficult to Write rich content and to read literature with that much ease as English.",,aswnr4,,0,,false,1553227849,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/aswnr4/why_do_you_think_english_is_so_important_in_india/,,,false,AskIndia,

She is owed her salary for the month of December 2018 which amounts to rupees 43000 and also she is owed rupees 20000 in other expenses which were covered by the company like site visit and travel for which she has all the receipts.

At the time of relieving she was told that they will be paying her entire amount by 10th of January 2019 which comes to around 63000 rupees. We waited for the 10th of January but did not hear anything from the company so we contacted them to which they replied that they will pay us in 5 to 6 days, again this time period passed and we did not get any amount from them since then everyday we call them, mail them also WhatsApp them to which they acknowledge sometimes that they will pay but they forgot to for some reason or the other and stall it for a day or two.

Now they have stopped picking up our calls the entire day they only pick up the call after their office is closed to which they reply that we forgot and we will process the next day but they never do. We have now run out of patience with them as our bills are piling up we have emails WhatsApp chats and some audio recordings of them acknowledging that the amount is due so what are our options in this case.

EDIT:

A lot of commentators asked for details, so here,

I didn't want to dive into them, it's very long and very triggering, which is why I kept it vague. I don't like being invalidated because I didn't explain it right and that just adds to the problem. It's a long chain.

In short, I have a long history (14-15 years) of daily sexual /really harsh physical abuse by my mother. Yes. I can't even begin do describe how harrowing it was, and how long it took me to realize the extent of damage it caused. 

This is the simplest part and actual issues are far more intricate. Things have never been normal. I do look normal, I mask it well. Had a successful career which tanked when these symptoms became worse. 

Haven't worked in last 5 years. Really unstable for day to day continuity. I'm in a good marriage, which is probably why I'm not dead. Stability is very important for my mental health, but I'm getting evicted for the second time in 2 years. Don't want to get into how it happened or legal aspects because everything that can be done has been done. And it may not be something very big but I'm at my wits end to what assholes people can be.

So, an elderly member of my family just received an email blackmailing him to send $800. The content of the email was this:

1. In the first line of the email, the blackmailer mentioned a password, which was one time used by my acquaintance, but now is defunct. This was what made the email stand out from other  spam messages.
2. Then they mention that my acquaintance had visited a pornographic website, ""xxx videos"" and that blackmailer had made a ""video"" of the event and has access contacts in FB, Messenger and ""e-mailaccount"". 
3. Then they threaten to send the video (of the video he was watching and also him watching the video) to all the contacts unless he pays  to a bitcoin account.
4.  They mention not to contact the authorities as they have covered their steps and won't be traceable. 

My acquaintance uses an old windows 7 laptop and has a decent free antivirus protection. And what takes the cherry is that he has put sticker on the webcam of the laptop. He read an article in the newspaper advising him to do so. LOL. But might have ""inadvertently"" clicked on a pop-up/email for a porn re-direct, which he claims he closed. This happened sometime in the past.

From the stand point of his laptop, what can we check for? Ran the antivirus which did not reveal anything alarming. Based on his best guess, he might have used this password on IRCTC website. Which might explain how the blackmailer got his registered email and password. Maybe the IRCTC accounts have been hacked, but this is just a guess at this stage.

More than anything, my acquaintance is livid that he has been targeted for a blackmail like this and is considering going to the police. He's not concerned about the ""video"" per se. Going by the email address, the weblink for the bitcoin ransom, would the police be able to trace the blackmailer? 

Please let me know your thoughts on this and maybe also have a chat with oldies/less tech savvy members of your family about general internet security. I've just done mine. :)

Cheers

I screwed up the location on Uber, but the Uber driver had another ride pending (Uber lets the driver partners to accept rides if the drop off location of the last customer and the pick up location of the next customer is nearby). I did not push him to drop me off, it was maybe 90 meters from where I was, so I was like, I will not let keep him waiting and interfere with his work

So a guy approaches me from a scooty and tells me can I borrow your phone for am minute, I need to call my mother. I gave him my phone (it was a OnePlus 6t) but I made sure to block off his scooty so that he does not run away.. He calls, and says something like ""uhh, phone nahi lagra"". Then he notices me blocking his way of the scooty, he says ""bhaiya Mai drop kardeta hun aapko Yamaha tak"". I stupidly leave the way to go to his pillion side and vrooom, the fucker runs away with me watching him in awe of my stupidity. I was shocked for a good 9-10 seconds so I could not gather many details, I just know it was a Delhi number.

When I was going to university in North Burnaby, BC, Canada in 1978, one of the local churches on Albert street was purchased for what I thought was a house of worship.  They had a big 'Om' symbol outside and I believe a triangular saffron flag. I attended several public events where BC politicians were invited. Although they had a murthi (Krsna? and rather oddly to me placed on the stage) I had the impression that it was more of a community hall for weddings and such.

Only recently did I come to realize that it is a political, or being generous, a cultural organization. I presume that most Canadians considered it to be a Mandir.

It makes me think, who was paying for this and what was their purpose? It was usually empty except for weekends and special events. The building is still there, although I believe the large property purchased on Marine Drive, also in Burnaby (South), and about to have new construction, is theirs.

1553533836,india,[deleted],self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b5ddgu/indian_salary_negotiation_tips/,37,55,,,Indian salary negotiation tips,"There is a disgusting and demoralising habit that companies have - something they do once they have decided to hire you.

This applies when you are a mid-level to senior-level developer and have really good skills.

""What 's your current CTC?""

Let's all resolve to say ""I am sorry I don't disclose that information"". Which is usually followed by ""No, we really need that number. It is standard process that we've done with 1000s of employees"".

That's when some people budge. They need you. Keep something in mind: - You have no obligation to follow the process they have. Especially not some weird protocol of how negotiations are done. You are in the job market and you are selling as a business person your services. The only protocol that is valid in that situation is that the conversation remain civil and polite and a mutually agreeable position can be arrived at. You are doing a business transaction. Act like a business person, grow a back bone and politely say ""That's too bad because I was really looking forward to working with you."" get up and then put your hands out to shake the company recruiter's hand.

Companies do that to low-ball you by getting an advantage in the negotiation by trying to figure out how much they can low-ball you so you can be made to accept the offer. No one has a moral higher ground and speak about unethical behaviour or immoral behaviour after something like that.

No one who does this has the moral higher ground to call out your lies. Do I really care if your Hadoop start-up is able to service clients? No. I can be made to care if you pay me something reasonable and as per market rates.

The days when there were only employers like TCS, Infosys and CTS who had all the cards in the IT employment market are long gone. We are starting to become silicon valley ourselves. We are rock-stars too. We should start acting line one.

This is especially true when you are changing jobs in which you are doing a completely different line of work, which has a completely different supply-demand equation. You may have made 4 lakhs per year as a Java developer. But as a developer on the hadoop platform you should be paid ~12 lakhs a year. But companies are able to low-ball you to ~6 lakhs a year.

We put in a tonne of effect to be current and be good at what we do. This one issue has a devastating effect on your morale and your growth when you find out what your colleagues are paid in comparison to you.

No one realises it but this never ends better or anyone. You are underpaid and in the end they don't get a employee who looks out for the best interests of the business.

Do not fill that section in the recruiter's email asking for more information. Recruiters are NOT working for you, they will try to say all kinds of bullshit to get you to give a number. Do not volunteer a number under any situation. Unless you are in dire need of a job and need one.

The negotiation needs to happen as a win-win not a lose-win. This sets up the relationship so that the first act that the company does to you is screw you over. It's going to be on the back of your mind throughout your tenure there and later.

With the current state of affairs in supply demand, if you are a web developer and you still hand your salary numbers out then you are seriously undermining your position. Developers in silicon valley are able to do it already. We should start also.

I bring to you the case of my housemaid. A very sweet single mom who cooks and cleans for a living here in Delhi.

I've been talking to her and I realize that she doesn't have a single identity document. She would very much like to remedy this situation but doesn't know where to start. 

She has no bank account, in order to make one she needs an ID document which she doesn't have. I took her to the post office to make her an Aadhaar card but the officers there asked for a birth certificate or a school certificate or a voter's ID. She has absolutely nothing. She has never been to school and has been living paycheck to paycheck. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her estranged husband had a bank account with SBI and she still has the passbook but it doesn't have her name on it. She also has kids who went to school for a few years and they also have some papers but her name doesn't appear on them.

&amp;#x200B;

She lives in a small apartment that she rents but her name is not on any of the utility bills. I'm guessing we can get an letter from the landlord as proof of address but I don't know where to go from there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Surely, the government must have some provision for such people who are out of the system? I am sure she is not the only one and it's such a vicious cycle to be stuck in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a filmmaker and my film won a cash award at an Indian film festival. However, they have withheld 31.2% “as per government of India regulation” for taxes. 

This is confusing because they had specifically requested I provide them an official German document that establishes my tax residency in Germany and absolves them of taxing me in India (as I understood it). Of course, Germany will now expect me to pay taxes on this income as well. That is double taxation and seems to go against tax treaties between the two countries. 

I have clients from many countries, and have NEVER paid tax in any country than the one I was a resident in. Is India really operating under a completely different system? Are there any tax savvy individuals here who have experience paying foreign individuals or companies (not residing in India) who can confirm or clarify my situation?

Thank you all in advance. I hope I haven’t broken any rules for this subreddit. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for chiming in thus far.  I really appreciate it. That being said, many comments here have done a good job of explaining where the 31.2% figure came from, and why prize money is considered income and therefor taxed. I have no problem understanding that income of any shape is taxed. What isn’t clear, is why I’m paying said tax to INDIA, a country I do not live or work in; a county I cannot claim any government benefits from; a country I do not have a tax ID number in; a country I cannot file a tax return in. I’d like to add that I have clients from all over the world and have ever paid taxes to another government before. It’s simply not the way it works. I’m sure some of you here have at some point done work for a foreign company before, whether it be graphic design, programming, or anything. Did those clients underpay you tremendously and claim that they withheld that money to pay their local taxes on your behalf? Unlikely. Did you then happily pay taxes again in India on that income (double taxation)? 

EDIT 2: you are all so awesome for helping me think this through and understand it. If I seem a bit annoyed, I promise it’s not with you, but with the complexities of interpreting tax law language!

Working a decent corporate job. I make \~14LPA. My parents are now retired. I've lived with them my whole life.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a good upbringing but my main problem has been that throughout my life, my family has been a group of over-thinkers, which has caused anxiety in me (and I'm sure in them) over things like ""What will you do?"" ""What if this?"" ""What if that?"" in every social, career, relationship position possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Till they were working, this was fine, but ever since they've retired, they are finding it tough to deal with such situations. They have a good networth, we own 3 properties (live in 1, rented 1), they have a good corpus in the bank and they've invested money in good mediums. We are debt free. They feel they will run out of money, inflation will eat them up, they won't have food in their old age etc. This leads to fights daily among my parents and I am in the middle of the it playing the referee. In their fights, they demean each other calling out each other's weaknesses and failed ambitions in life. I felt this would happen a few days after retirement, but it's almost been a year now and it's non-stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I do contribute to the house here and there but I feel that it'll hurt my father's ego if I start paying for household expenses. My father restricts a lot of travel to other cities citing expenses. My mom tells me in her fits of anger to ""pay"" for her to travel to other cities. I have volunteered but never followed through cause they never decided to go anywhere. **Are they waiting for me to take initiative / is their ego stopping them from asking / will I hurt their ego by paying?**

My mom has to feel in control of the house. With the timings of the maid to the food brought into the house. Even on the ocassions that my parents are back in their village for a week or two  - it's non stop. She cannot let go of things. **Does she feel she will lose control of the house if I take care of things?**

&amp;#x200B;

There's a fight every second week over something or the other and the parents are not on talking terms for days. They had one today morning as I came to office. **Is this normal?**

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this is leading me to a situation where I am :

1. Worried to make any big spends of my own and having the independence to do so - be it a trip with my friends, maybe a property on my name etc. How do I tackle this when it comes up? I don't want to be in a situation where my mom is like ""we aren't taking that train trip but you are going on joytrips with your friends?""
2. If I get married and live with my parents (Which my mom pretty much expects me to) will this be a conducive situation to start off my married life?  Specially with their fighting and all. How do I draw the line and be clear without hurting their feelings?
3. Has anyone moved out of their parents' house with some level of resentment (before or after marriage) and kept good cordial terms with their parents?
4. I feel a bit burdened and tied down in my house cause of few of the things here and otherwise. I am not always the happiest person when I get back home and look forward to office even though it's dull at times. Is this normal?
5. I have thoughts of getting a new job in another city and moving there alone and starting afresh (easier to change cities than get another house in the city). Is this okay? Does this make me a horrible child for abandoning 60 year old parents at home after retirement?

&amp;#x200B;

Any other general pointers would be appreciated. Thanks in Advance.

She was very good in academics and sports in her school days. Secured &gt;95% in class 10 boards and top in her school. My parents, sent her to Kota for IIT prep at Bansal classes. Developed home sickness and depression, could not cope up with studies, and my parents were forced to cancel the classes and bring her back. Appointed psychiatrist, medication started. Meanwhile re-admitted to the same school for class 11 and 12. My parents dead set wanted her to do IIT and had her take some local institutes. She was so much focussed on IIT that she messed up her class 11 school marks, but passed, and also secured &gt;80% in class 12 boards. Meanwhile her mental condition was deteriorating and mending repeatedly and active change in medication. Gave AIEEE, did not make it.. My dad was disappointing. Got admitted in Kurukshetra University instead for B.Tech in Instrumentation. Mental condition again began going downhill, add it to terrible home sickness and ragging, she went completely crazy in her second year, She was causing unrest among her roommates, refused to take medication and tore apart her *suraksha kawach*(my dad is a strong superstitious and religious person).

Again my parents brought her back and appointed another doctor in Delhi. She skipped a year. Resumed Uni after a year and graduated. Also got two job offers from campusing. She agreed on IBM and her training began in 2017 in Bangalore. Not even 6 months and again home sickness to the point that she resigned and came back home despite my parents and even me telling her to atleast think twice.

Now I think my dad is to blame for some part. He was stubborn, violent and did not listen to anybody. He was extremely religious and superstitious. He also maintained a fake image before others. Spent WAY TOO less money(I consider myself upper middle class), and rarely he would take us to trips or spend on some new clothes. I mean maybe once in every 3 years... His behavior has definitely gotten better in recent years, maybe because I am bit rebellious as compared to my sister.

Fast forward to present, she is 24, and just sitting around in house, obese, no future plans, not willing to even do household chores. Mental situation has got much better but now she is just unwilling to do anything. Tried to get a bank job previous year but failed the interviews. Not listening to anybody not even the doctor. Now being a struggling class 11 myself I cannot give much time to her. Parents have already given up hope and thinking about marrying her off.

How can I help him?,"I(24) am new to this site in fact this is my first post so I hope I am not violating any rules. This is about my younger brother(19) who has completely changed in the past few months. He has always been the favorite of everyone in our family and at the same time he has been really close to me. But in the past few months I observed that he started acting differently. Earlier he used to talk with me a lot and share a lot of details of his life with me. Always asked me about advice regarding girls etc but this is no more the case. I thought it was just him growing up and I didn't care. But he also got into fights with our parents recently which never happened before. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week when both of us were at our home during the festive season, I casually brought this topic and asked if something was wrong. Initially he avoided the discussion but later he started arguing with me as well. My father interfered and he ultimately calmed down. This was the first time he shouted at me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then later that week I found him posting something on his laptop. When he saw that I was observing him he started shouting at me and called me a bitch. We argued but he continued shouting and I couldn't hold me tears. Our parents were not at home and so they don't know about this. Later I decided to visit the site he was browsing. The site was named incels and when I visited it I was shocked.

&amp;#x200B;

It is basically a site where men post the most outrageous things about women and other people but it is mostly women. I spent some time on the website and it looks like users on that site hate women. Some users talk about suicide, others were celebrating incidents of women being assaulted. Overall it consisted of very misogynistic and violent material.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how my brother ended up over there and why he ended u over there. We both had to leave the next day for college and he hasn't talked to me since then. I tried calling him but he didn't pick up the phone. I don't know what to do at this point. It looks like something not that big since it is just him visiting a website but the kind of content that exists there coupled with his violent behavior recently I am feeling concerned about him. I am worried that he might hurt himself or get into a fight with someone.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys suggest? I don't know how to talk or what to talk to him. I also don't know why he is acting like this. Don't want to talk to anyone in our daily life about this.

Sounds too good to be true though.,"A close relative of mine is buying a property and the agent told us this - so when the bank disburses a loan, it will create a Current Account where the money (say 1 crore) will be deposited.

The interest rate is calculated based on the money that has been taken out of this account. So if you have paid off 30 lakhs to the builder, the bank charges you interest only on this amount.

Now, if you have free liquid cash with you, you can deposit this money into the current account so that the interest rate comes down dramatically. 

For example, let's say you have 20 lakhs in liquid cash in your savings or FD. You can put this money into the current account and so this money is deducted while calculating interest. (Edit: This money can be withdrawn as and when you like, just like a regular savings account)

So hypothetically if you have 1 crore in liquid cash and are taking loan only for tax purposes, you can repay with 0% interest. 

You save money since FDs and savings only give you max 6% interest. But you save 9% worth of outgoing interest by putting this money in the current account.

And these channels mint a lot of money with these broadcasts. Sports media has at least evolved to bring badminton, *kabaddi*, etc. into mainstream where earlier only cricket ruled. I personally don't have anything against these forms of entertainment, however, it kind of feels like these are the only few talents left in a country of over a billion people. 

By identifying only a few selected fields as ""profitable"", are we failing to provide people with other talents the platform and support they require? For e.g. we all know where India stands at the Olympics medals tally. Had cricket not been so widely assumed the only ""profitable"" sport to invest in, don't you think India would have a larger Olympic medals count today?

Growing up we had programmes like quiz competitions, science exhibitions, educational debates, classical arts, etc. Now everything is either a singing or a dancing competition. Comedy too is just so loud with all the unnecessary canned laughter tracks. I am probably exaggerating this but is this just what we've become? Or are these programmes the result of what we've always been? A bunch of loud people consuming more and more noise everyday.

Hence starting this thread. we can discuss/ask everything about Global Entry application process here for Indian Citizens. I will try to add as much information as possible which I find from various blogs/websites.

For those who don't know about it - Global Entry Program is a Trusted Travel Program by  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This program allows travelers for expedited processing (for pre-approved, low-risk travelers) when entering into the United States. It is not a replacement for Visa. It just expedites the immigration process at the port of entry into USA. Global Entry Program is primarily for US Citizens, but citizens of a few countries are also eligible to apply. India has been added to the list of these few countries recently. Normally Indian Citizens are not eligible for TSA-PreCheck, but if someone has Global Entry, then he becomes eligible for TSA-Pre as well.

**Feel free to post your experiences/questions about Global Entry Application process in this thread.**

2. While I'm talking on my phone, I feel as if my phone's battery will blast and my ears and will burn and I'll struggle with the pain and nobody would be able to help me. 

3. If I'm eating something with fork, I get thoughts like someone will hit my hand and it'll tear my inside of the mouth leaving it painful. 

4. If I drink water, I get thoughts like some creepy insect like cockroach or huge spider or snake is hiding inside it and while drinking it'll get inside my body and damage all my internal body parts and I'll die a painful death.

5. When I'm talking to someone, my mind imagines that I'll give a lip kiss to her suddenly or open my pants and maturbate in front of her or act like crazy mad guy etc.

First, there were a few incidents involving the traffic police where they randomly catch couples on a bike and start extracting money. The pitiable thing is that it is easier to simply bribe them and get away but if you start questioning, ""what was my fault?"" then two things will happen. First, nobody will come to support you (other riders will simply mind their own business), and secondly the cops will then take you to the station and thump some truly nefarious charge on you. So, a ""dishonest"" dude gets away by simply paying a bribe, whereas a honest one not only pays a lot more, but also adds a criminal record to his/her name? This situation is simply pathetic.

Then there was [this quint story](https://www.thequint.com/my-report/moral-policing-in-bengaluru-college-kids-claim-harassment-by-cops-christ-university) about a bunch of Christ University students being harassed for playing with colors on Holi day.

*I have invented a 3D printer which will be the world's fastest 3D printer. I have a prototype &amp; it runs super fast. It prints objects faster than Carbon3D printers.*

I'm a single inventor &amp; the project is unaffiliated to the university. I'm trying to making millions out of it because I have tirelessly worked, 15 hours a day on it over an year. What's the right way? *Selling the provisional patent which I have applied or launching a Startup to manufacture these printers?*

Carbon3D is a unicorn which is worth more than billion dollars since it's inception from 2014. Carbon3D solves the print time problem. I have a better technology &amp; the prototype proves it.

Functional parts can be made super fast without sacrificing the print quality which will serve as a replacement for injection molding.

It's common that every startup founder or inventor to have million dollar dreams. But I think my invention is ground breaking the future of manufacturing. This technology deserves multi million dollars.

Non-news should be a thing in today's world of instant news and instant shit. Sanity in this insane world that we've never imagined we'll ever be is non-news. And it should be yesterday because you've been through it and it's fresh in mind. I'll go first.

1. Yesterday I saw three donkeys after a very long time. I used to see and hear them almost everywhere. They've become a rare sight while I am growing up. They look old and don't look like they are in a good shape.
2. Yesterday I thought for few minutes why wasn't I am seeing monkeys in my neighborhood? They used to be everywhere in my childhood. That once again reminded me of a video made by one History professor on Pigeons in US. In early 19^th century 
2. Yesterday I watched a video on retrograde motion of Mars ~~mercury (and also sun)~~ again after a very long time. This time around I really wondered what it takes to observe such a motion. 

    a. First, curiosity of what's out there in the space; instead of just ignoring because it's been always there and can be seen everyday.

    b. Keep seeing one specific part of space, notice a specific object in the sky

    c. Identify the same object the next day

    d. Notice that that specific object has shifted it's position in fucking space and not a coordinate plane.  mean, you've got to have much more than a photographic memory to keep track of location of an object in space

   e. This comes before (d). The idea that I should keep track of it's location when you never knew it could move around/rotate/revolve.

    f. And the notice that the movement is strange. How many of us (in India) would do this in 21^st century? Apparently, this was observed by Greeks back in ~ 200 BC.
   
4. One auntie got mad at her husband/children and was screaming and shouting in no particular direction for a long time, even after they're gone. It seemed to stop at lunch time
5. I thought I should try making dosa using Chik Peas (Channa?) Yesterday I made batter and today morning I tried making dosas. It was a disaster. Was able to make just one dosa and it did taste dammed good. I am trying to make idli with the rest of the batter. It's work in progress.
6. All of a sudden Elpy mode is freezing my emacs. Need to find out why soon. I can't stand a monster memory guzzler Intellij.
7. Yesterday I bought 1KG really good tomatoes for 11 bucks.

&amp;#x200B;

This is going to be a super long post but I really really need some help here. Let me start with the explanation of my situation first:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an Indian girl who was raised in the Middle East, so I had a pretty non-conservative upbringing. I've always seen my family as progressive - putting my education and my career above all else, being able to major in what I want to, my parents being okay with me identifying as atheist. I'm currently 24 (25 this year), and finishing up my first year in my Master's program in the US - I did my undergrad here too. However, between my undergrad and grad I moved home for about two years, which is where I met and started dating who I consider to be the love of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

He's my first boyfriend, yes, but we started dating at age 23 and have a pretty mature relationship, while not taking ourselves too seriously. Before meeting him, I was recovering from a pretty horrible emotionally abusive fwb situation. I've also been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. My parents know about my diagnosis, but they don't really believe in it - I had a pretty ugly argument with them about my former suicide attempt (because my fwb attempted to sexually assault me, which of course I didn't tell them about because no sex before marriage). Since I've met my boyfriend, however, I've become more confident in myself and can deal with my issues better and in a healthier way (aka not resorting to alcohol or self-harm anymore). I like what I've grown into since I met him.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's my issue:

1. My boyfriend will be starting his Master's program this year, at age 25. I'll finish one year before he does. My parents believe that 27 is the ""right age"" to get married, but at 27 he would just be graduating so his situation won't be completely stable at that point. They think 28 is ""too late"".
2. My parents have a friend who had complications in her pregnancy at age 30, so they want me to have kids before that - even though I have no interest in kids until I'm in my 30s.

So basically, even though they claim to like him, they've been cold towards him from the beginning. When I was home for winter break, they had a 3-hour long talk with me where they straight-up told me we can't get married. They want me to break up with him by May, and then meet someone ""older and settled"", and then get married to him IN TWO YEARS' TIME.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have spoken about it, and we want to be together and get married. He knows all about my parents and I know he'll stay and fight, but I hate it. I hate that my parents won't accept us, I hate that my boyfriend is getting hurt by this, and I hate the insane amount of pressure on me. Don't I get a say in my own life? When I told them I didn't wanna break up with him, my dad basically threatened to call his dad and get our engagement fixed. We wanna do it at our pace!

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been close to my family but now I dread talking to them on the phone, I dread bringing him up, and I'm dreading seeing them in person next. I don't want to lie to them but I don't know what to do. They refuse to listen to reason, they refuse to listen to the fact that I love him and I want to spend my life with him. They refuse to acknowledge that I'm an adult and that I can make my own decisions - ESPECIALLY about someone I want to spend the rest of my life with. They say love marriages are okay ""but not with him"". They refuse to accept the fact that I'm okay with getting married at an older age, and that I don't want children until I'm older.

&amp;#x200B;

My anxiety levels are at an all-time high. Until recently I was underweight and managed to gain weight when I was home, but now I can barely bring myself to eat most days. I throw up everything I eat because of the stress, I can barely sleep at night. I randomly start crying for absolutely no reason, and I'm not a crier. I'm going to class and killing myself to maintain my 4.0 GPA (which is another requirement of theirs) while working 20 hours a week at my job. I'm pretty sure I'm going through a depressive episode. I've tried contacting mental health services but no one has gotten back to me yet - it's been a month since I first called them. I haven't hurt myself in years but I keep thinking about it now, and I'm really scared I'll act on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty depressed.,"So it's been 2 years now of trying to get married ""the arranged way"" . Have couple of profiles on those matrimonial sites. Ended talking to few people . My family is a little fucked up and dad and mom are separated. So the initiative is always has to be from my side but in these arranged setups , the family plays a big role. Second problem I feel I'm mentally and in term of experience much more mature than the girls I've talked so I always feel I wouldn't be able to get on with most of them. Thirdly the girls who I can mentally connect with always end up having like 40-50x more choices then me and always keep you hook and at that time you don't really feel like you want to put your all in those situations , knowing there are 50 more guys doing the same , so it's kind of a rat race. 
 . 
In other societal criteria , I think I would score pretty good. In term of the job , education , appearance , etiquette and stuff. 

This has been depressing me to point that I have started taking sleeping pills at night. 

Any of you experience something similar , how do I feel with this harrowing feeling of ending up alone for the rest of my life.  I'm 30 , turning 31 in a week. 

Your views and experience can help me understand and navigate this situation .

Thank you .

1. Indian clothes like kurta pyjama are so much more comfortable especially when the weather is hot or humid. I feel bad for the men I see in Bombay hanging off local trains, in the heat, wearing pants, fully buttoned up, full sleeves, collars, etc. 

2. Seems unfair that only western formals count as office wear for men, while women can wear both Indian and western clothes (I realize this is highly dependent on area, so I’m only talking about metros and places where both men and women regularly work)

3. I think most Indian men look much better in Indian clothes. Of course nobody should have to dress to please other people, but a lot of other women I know also think Indian men look more attractive in Indian clothes, especially considering the number of Indian men with large tummies bursting out of their trousers... anyway, this is not important. 

Dhotis, lungis etc may be too cumbersome and impractical, but I don’t understand why a standard kurta pyjama for men is not more popular, which is very similar to the salwar kameez women wear regularly, with or without dupatta.

i think my father might be having an affair.


i am 24 years old. my parents have been married for the same period now. 

i have caught my father several times now. not face to face but indirectly.
one time i saw an old feature phone like the old nokia 1100,
being charged at 1st floor of our house (we have a 3 story building) at around 5 am. i was taking my workout clothes at that time. while i was exiting the room, my father came in and after that i never saw that phone again.


i am pretty sure my father has 2 sims as well. 
one time i was looking down at our street from our roof and i saw a ladies helmet, the ones that sort of looks like a construction hat, underneath my fathers helmet, when he was putting his helmet inside the storage inside his scooter.


one time my parents had a huge fight and i saw my father crying. seeing him cry i too busted into tears. at that time i asked my mother to stop falsely accusing my father of an affair as i was sure that my father would do no such thing but this was before i caught him in the incidents mentioned above.


now every other day, my parents fight. my mom went as far ahead as asking my father to divorce her and live with the other woman he's been with.


just now, my mothers sisters visited us, and my mom and her sister were sitting in another room. then my mom started crying but never said a word to her sister. 


seeing her cry has made me wonder about the situation my mother is in. she has so many things bottled inside her that she cant share it with anyone else.


my parents having been sleeping in separate rooms now for more than a year. 
my father sleeps on the sofa in our drawing room while my mother sleep in the bedroom.



all of this is also taking an emotional toll on me. 
my father is almost 50 years old. we dont have any problem at our house except this. i dont know why is he doing something that is destroying our peace. 


i dont know how to handle this situation. 

please advise me guys. 

should i confront my father? should i hire a reputed pi to gather proof and then confront my father? should i ask my parents to go see a marriage counselor?


i dont know what to do guys. please help me.",,arjgv8,,0,,false,1553200060,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/arjgv8/father_might_be_having_an_affair/,,,false,AskIndia,

&amp;#x200B;

So I've an elder brother who's currently 25, and for last 3-4 months he has a girlfriend and they're are quite open about their relationship. Parents of both sides know about the relationship. But the thing is that they wanna get married ASAP! I mean they wanna take this 3-4 months relationship into next level. The girl's parents are obviously pushing it more than my family cause Indian culture has it girl should be married as soon as she turns 25.

But the thing is I'm pretty sure my brother is blinded by this ""love"" all of a sudden, he wanted to do his Masters and go into AI development, but now all of a sudden all he wants to do is ""marry"" and that too with just that girl or else I quote ""He'll remain single his entire life"" . My parents of course are against all this bullshit. We ain't that rich and ""blessed"", parents were expecting that once he does his masters he will be supporting the family and then only he would be getting married and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

All he does now is video call her 24\*7, roam around the house with her on video call, no longer wants to do masters, I'm pretty sure he has forgotten the struggle my parents had to go through to make sure he gets his B. Tech ( we're not that financially stable). Is doing all the typical nice guy stuff, complementing her on video call in-front of whole family just to show ""Hey you see girl!!! I'm so vocal"".

&amp;#x200B;

Everything he does now he'll tell her, all the family's deepest secrets have been told. Of which my parents aren't very proud of. He doesn't have a ""real job"" as of now.

&amp;#x200B;

My deepest fear is that this stupid mistake of his can ruin his life, or tear my family apart.

Sorry for the long-winded post. There is a TL;DR at the bottom.

Ignorant American here. I am in desperate need of change. Real, serious change. Not to go into too much detail (I can if it helps), but I've been having a dreadful couple of years, all stemming mostly from my medical issues and chronic pain. Because of these medical issues I have gained weight, and become a shell of who I thought I was. I'm contemplating taking a 6-month 'sabbatical' to India to try and fix this mess that is my life. 

A little bit of backstory. I've been an athletic person for the majority of my life, but I've also had serious injuries &amp; medical issues most of my life as well. (First surgery was at 8-weeks old.) I was really active in my teen's, and at points in great shape. I fell in love with Jiu-Jitsu and was training regularly. But thanks to injuries and being in a constant state of pain in my joints, I can no longer do it. Actually, it's been years since I've trained. Which is depressing. I wanted to do this for a living, and now I can't even train the basics.

I have an 'all or nothing' attitude that I can't seem to shake. That makes working out at the level I am at now, nearly impossible. I just get so frustrated I can't take it so I either do too much, and end up screwed for weeks, or I don't do it at all. The only exercise that seems bearable now is Yoga. I enjoy Yoga, and it seems to be demanding enough to keep me mentally there, but not overly taxing on my poorly built body. Because of this I want to really learn Yoga, and make it a part of my life. Maybe even teach it.

So why India? A few reasons. **One**, I couldn't think of a better place to learn Yoga. **Two**, I am desperate for something that can get me out of this funk. Maybe getting rid of my apartment and moving to the other side of the world is just what I need? It sure feels like it. **Three**, I don't just want to change my career path, or how I work out, I want to change who I am. Right now, I don't like me. Worse, *I hate myself and who I've become*. I want to change every part of me, from spirituality, to how I eat, to how I work out. Everything. **Four**, from what I can tell, it is inexpensive to live. I have a unique opportunity to work remotely via my laptop. It doesn't pay a lot, but should be enough to cover my expenses if what I have seen is accurate for rent/living cost. **Five**, the experience. Even if I take what I learn and only use it for myself, I feel like this would be a well-spent 6-months.

The goal? Work a little less on actual work, and work a lot more on me. Get some life experience, see a new place. Experience a new way of life. Try to come back home as someone I actually like.

So my questions are:

1. If I were to do this, where is a great place for an American to live? I've been looking at Goa, as there seems to be a good Yoga retreat there. While I don't mind big cities, I'd much prefer something a little more 'chill'.
2. Are there any live/learn yoga programs that anyone knows of that are longer than 3-4 weeks? I'd love to work on a program the entire time I am there, so several months.
3. What are some of the hardships of being an American in such a different country? Are the locals accepting of a foreigner?
4. I have a service dog for one of my medical disorders. She is 9-years old this week. Has anyone had experience with a legitimate service dog in India? Will this go over well or will it be offensive to the locals? Is the culture dog-friendly in general? This is probably my biggest concern, should have been #1.
5. If I wanted or needed it, are there any programs or jobs that would suit an American. I only speak English. That said I am planning on learning what I can about local culture and local languages.

I have a million other questions swirling around, but I can't whisk any other thoughts together at the moment. I'm sure I will get the 'why not just learn Yoga where you live?' which is an extremely valid question. I could do more yoga here, and I should. It's kind of a culmination of things, but it's really the chaos in my life. I go to yoga, feel a little better for an hour, then get out and I'm back to my mad world. I just don't think it will stick without a drastic change. Also it seems India is cheaper to live, so I can possibly get away with working remotely for fewer hours, and have more time to reflect and fix my broken body/mind. 

**TL;DR:** I am in pain, mentally and physically. Yoga is the only 'workout' that I can manage anymore. I am considering moving to India to change my way of life, make Yoga a staple in it, and to get an experience and hopefully a new perspective on life.

It was raining all night here and these were all wet. We moved them to our home, used a towel to soak the water of their body and placed them inside a box with a hotbag in the lower part and some clothes on top of it then placed the puppies on the top of those clothes. 

Don't know how old are these, local people telling me that their mom died after giving birth to them which I wasn't able to verify.

We didn't have any baby dog milk so made a drink with 1 part amul gold liquid milk, 1 part water and two egg yolks. I have been giving that to them 1 hours apart for now. 

I will be going to a pet shop for their milks, would be great if you guys recommend something and some tips on what should I do. 

Thanks! 

Edit: I asked some other local guys and they said these were born last Monday and their mom has been raising them until yesterday. Last night she died. Again I can't verify if they are true or not since not sign of any dead body here. So they are 1 week old. 

My sister called a vet and she said to give them amul spray, I'll be going out to get some Royal canin dog milk supplement or something similar. 

and we don't plan to keep them. We'll probably give them away for adoption.

She was treated and paid well, and they never had complaints over her work. Recently the apartment complex my parents live in passed a rule saying maids cannot sit on the park benches in the open courtyard. I disagree with this rule, and think it is discrimination against the working poor. Anyway some weeks later the housing board informed my parents that our maid was trying to organize other maids to protest this action, which surprised my parents who had no idea. He also informed her that she regularly attends all sort of parties and is basically a slut. 

When confronted she said she did try to organize the maids, but vehemently denied the accusations that she ""parties"" and what not, saying they're made up (I believe her, I think the housing authority just wanted to tarnish her, what ""parties"" do maids even attend?) Our parents asked her to stop this, but she refused saying she has the legal right to organize. According to my father some of the language she used made him think she must have some knowledge or experience in activism or politics. 

Though my parents did not want to fire her, she was adamant she would not stop (though was calm the whole time). The housing authority wanted her gone, as in the past there have been cases where organized maids have gone on strike and even resorted to physical action, and they did not want this.

Some time after firing her, a new maid was hired via agency. After few days she stopped coming and agency said she doesn't like working for you, which surprised my parents because they are not demanding or rude (and they aren't, they've always treated support staff respectfully). Another maid was hired, and few days later she left. When my parents recently went to a shopping mall by drive they were shocked to return to the car and find all tires were slashed. Nothing in car was stolen though. Police and security have no clue on who did it. There was no camera in the area recording. Then the names of my parents were sprayed on to the walls surrounding the complex, again no one knows or saw whom.

My mother and father are now very frightened by these incidents and have no idea what to do. They do not know where they maid went after being fired, nor does anyone (incl. police) know either. They've tried speaking to other maids in the complex but they don't seem to know much about her other than the fact that she always talked about social issues, which surprised my parents because she never discussed such things to them even once in those 2 years.

Regarding the maid, she does not have much education but apparently reads many Hindi ebooks and blogs from her phone. She comes from Jharkhand, she is not married.

Anyone have any advice on how to end this? The stress is bothering my parents a lot, especially because they were reluctant to fire her.

I'm on a bus to Nainital, there was a group of people sitting behind me.

I'm a graphic designer, and I'd gone for the same exhibition the previous year as well. They seemed pretty cool and on my wavelength, so I resolved to talk to them when the bus stopped for dinner. When the universe plays these games with me, I like to engage... Anyway another snippet of their conversation where a guy in the group asked a girl to post something on r/India, and they considered the possibility that it hit the front page.

Then the bus stopped... but it turned out that the Nainital passengers were being redirected to another bus. I had to leave, they stayed on. Was annoyed at myself for not taking the initiative earlier. Thought the opportunity was lost, and it was killing me a bit.

While on this new bus, it struck me that I can browse by new on r/India and deduce who they are. That didn't work, so this is my final resort - asking the country, and hoping that said party answers this post with a ""Yes, I am, what the holy fuck""

Recently, a friend of mine in Bangalore was bullied by the cops just because they were waiting for their bus a few feet before the bus stop. On navigating the Bengaluru Police Station’s social media page, I noticed that their bullying has been a repeat offence and my friend wasn’t the only one. Some cases include slapping a girl just for playing Holi (a festival where people play with colours), forcing people to go inside police station and strip and most notably harassing young people for simply talking to the opposite sex. 

In my friend’s case, this was how he was bullied by them – He and his other friend were waiting for their bus when a ladycop drove up to them and this is how the conversation went – 

Officer – Why are you standing here?

Friend – We’re waiting for a bus ma’am

Officer – The bus stop is ahead, it is not here 

Friend – Yes ma’am but there is a lot of traffic there so we thought we’ll board from here 

Officer – Oh so you have a masterplan and everything?

Friend – Nothing of that sort ma’am

Officer – What if someone comes from behind and (uses her hand in a back and forth motion to show an offensive gesture) 

At this point, my friend took out his phone and started recording their conversation. While she was talking in Kannada, my friend continued to try speaking in English. The lady cop noticed the phone and after getting out of her car, snatched it and attempted to drive away with it. My friend tried to stop her and didn’t let her close her car’s door. The people around them noticed the commotion and demanded him to apologize to her. He promptly did and then she told him “You may have apologized but what about my self-respect? Everybody saw.” 

Thereafter, she threatened to file a case against him and called for backup. She ordered the crowd to disperse and then told him that if he wanted his phone back, he needs to drive with her to the station and write an apology. He requested that his father be informed of this but she told him that he can call him only if he gets in her car. After getting inside, she started driving straight for the police station. On the way, she kept telling them that the gesture was a very common one and that they would have their bones broken in North Karnataka. Additionally, she kept abusing them verbally during the entire trip. 

At the police station, they were stripped off of their belongings and they didn’t let him call his father. Then they started taking their mugshots and kept them like that for a few hours. After consistent requests, they asked if he had any money to which he replied he didn’t. They were again left unattended for half an hour and another officer who came by told them that there was no case here and to let them off with a warning. The cop went up to them and told them not to do it again and let them go. 

All our lives, we believed that police are there to protect us but cases like this are so frequent over there and so much little can be done. I know that lawfully they’re wrong but what exactly can be done when they can simply file any case on you or simply beat you up? Are we supposed to just accept and live like this or is there anything that can be done? After going through a couple of stories, the lady cop comes up in a lot of cases and other policemen are ready to accept any bribes to prevent them from hurting us or bullying us. If they’re the ones bullying us, who exactly can we look up to?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Lady Cop assaults and threatens to press charges for absolutely nothing. Similar cases has been found through their social media handles and they haven't replied to any of them. Legally, is there anything that we can do to take actions against them?

This was around the time of coal mine scams due to which a lot of industrial projects had to be shut down.

   I was 13 when we had come back to our home town, the plan was to find a new job in a month. But most of the jobs that were offered to my father we're rejected by him as the salary was lower than what he used to earn.
Fast forward to four years, he has fallen into depression. He emptied most of his savings and now depends on his brothers for help, which I'm sure will stop soon too.
We've had regular quarrels regarding his state but he just isn't ready to let go of his ego and take up a smaller job. It is impacting us and our functioning as well. I'm especially worried about my little sister and what impact my father is currently having on her.

   Three days ago, I had an agreement with him. I'll sign him up for jobs on websites and in return, if a recruiter calls him, he will take the job. So please help me, I want him to become healthy asap. And I want our home to be peaceful again. I've tried sending his resume to a lot of companies but none have called yet.


If you have or know of any vacancy that is suitable for him please pm me, I'll send you a resume.

Some details:

He's 53 years old.

He has a degree in B.Tech Mechanical

He has an experience of 20 years of working in steel industrial projects.

no friends, never been in relationship, i have tried but could never make friends, couldn't relate to anyone or anything, still tried to hang around but got told to fuck off explicitly, this happened multiple times before i gave up.

no talent, no hobbies, no interests, no passions, neither book smart, nor street smart. No discernible qualities...

have no meaningful relationships to anyone including parents, but even they have made it clear that they aren't very fond of me. They would've kicked me out a long time ago if not for keeping up social appearances, but they've made it clear that their tolerance is limiting.

Never had a drink, Never smoked, Never had any habits, Never watched enough movies, Didn't play much sports, most of my lifetime has been passed just sitting emptily...

Have somehow managed to get dealt every bad genetics card, yet have no disease to blame them for..

Fugly looking... I know, its not how you  look but... I've tried to dress well, groom well, put up a positive attitude... and got shut down pretty quickly... yeah definitely the face is a problem. You know how people say punchable faces, i have it (as i said every bad genetic traits that can't be blamed on some disease/disorder.. I have it). Pretty sure got shut out of few job interviews just by my looks.

Can't get a company job, not smart enough to get jobs through exams, blocked by my own fatness out of physical jobs. My own degree has become a hurdle as people reject me out of low end jobs purely out of suspicion that i might quit. -_-

Never had a meaningful conversation with another human being before, never had any pets... So... no meaningful connection with another living being...

I did try to run away thinking of restarting, a few years back... only to realize how fucking clueless i was, i did ask around few random shops and hotels for job, they took one look at me and told me to fuck off, realized that even poor people are well connected among themselves and its pretty much impossible for some one like me to find work... returned to parents in shame. I know there are lot of people in worse situations, but i clearly lack survivability. So...

(I have no clue how people just move to new places and make a living...)

I would've liked to think i had some mental issues, but pretty much sure i'm just stupid as fuck. From the last couple of years i seem to have lost it, because i'm now unable to stand and talk to another person as my heart starts racing so fast, some times feels like i'm having a heart attack just by being around others (This also have become a problem for me, because i can't tell if i'm having a real heart attack from my obesity or it's just the fear of talking to others). My hands literally start shaking just answering even marketing phone calls, i can't utter a complete sentence at another person before my mouth runs dry and words get stuck in my throat... So i just run away and hide or try to avoid any conversation altogether.

I used to think i was good at programming and technology, only to realize i knew fuck all as i studied further, add some unpleasant experiences surrounding that which i don't even want to recall, it pretty much broke me down, from last few months i have stopped applying, i have sopped trying. This has gotten so bad that even when i said fuck it  let me just give it another go, i am unable to do it.. like physically unable.. you know how people struggle while being mind controlled but ultimately give in and fail, its a feeling like that, i have literally tried to use my hands to push my own leg out the door and something within myself was disallowing me to go through with that. So, I gave up  and have shut myself in.

There is a constant looming thought of just offing myself and spare everyone the hassle of standing me, but i'm positively affirmative that i don't have the courage for it.

I mean i'm not sure why i am putting it all up, probably because i have only a few days left before i even run out of internet, my folks have even decided to move (yeah i never had a permanent address either which is making things a bit more complex). I am already not able to get a living in a big city, pretty sure i will have absolutely jack shit if i follow them to the small town (even they, are clear about not wanting me to come with them). I mean if i were to believe in every movie i've watched and every story i've read, you don't go move to a small town to get things done, that move is pretty much reserved for getting away from things. Since, I need things to gravitate towards, i shouldn't move.. right??

So basically, never did anything, never connected with anyone, Never traveled anywhere, Have nothing to look forward to, Have no motivation to do anything, Everything seems pointless... whats the point of just being without any purpose or direction? Or no resource to fill the void of having no purpose or direction? 
Is such a life even worth living? Am i worth existing??

FUCK!!

___________________________________________________
So,... I kindah have decided to make myself a purpose, thought i should start with improving my body first, but i can't afford gym membership (because that's the fastest way i could think of... i know i could just walk and jog for free, but those things takes years and i don't have years to spare). I am willing to work for it, is there anyway i can get something that will be able to pay for the following things?

A safe place to stay/sleep  .

Food to eat.

a gym membership

phone/internet

Commuting

spare money for getting clothes and stuff ( i don't have much to begin with, if i take working out seriously, i probably gonna need them).

I am willing to go anywhere as long as these things can be afforded from what i make at where i will be (or you don't have to pay me anything if you can provide me these things in exchange for the work).

I  can understand English, Hindi and kannada.

I AM good with computers than the average person though... if that matters, and probably the only thing i can be sure of with all the self-confidence i have left.

Therefore, they started searching for girls for me to marry. Apparently, I didn’t wanted to marry but due to the fact that sooner or later they are going to force me to marry, I decided to choose the best girl out of all those I have met. I chose one…our marriage got fixed and I really like that girl. My parents lied to her family about my salary and told them that it is 25k per month. I don’t like lying to my future wife and want to tell the truth. However, if she accepted me then she will be disappointed with my earning potential and if she rejects me then the marriage will break. My parents will get to know that I told the girl the truth despite being told not to by them. Also, if this marriage breaks then my parents will be disappointed in me and then the next girl will not be of my choice. I am in a dilemma. My parents are not allowing me to change the job right now as it might impact badly on marriage and telling me to search job after 6 months of marriage.

I had to take my scooter out of my garage. But my neighbor had put some bamboo canes (used in building tents for functions) in front of our garage door. I went to their house to ask them to remove them. A man in his 40s came out. I first politely asked him to remove all the stuff. He said he couldn't hear me. So I went nearer and once again told him the same. He again said he couldn't hear me and gave me a smirk. Then I realized he could hear me very well and just didn't want to remove the canes. I got a bit angry and told him in a higher pitch to remove his stuff. Then he slapped me very hard and started hitting me on the head repeatedly. I somehow ran from there and called my parents outside. In the meantime, the one who assaulted me also called his family. Both of the families started arguing. The assailant's family then started saying it was my mistake for speaking in a disrespectful tone to an elder. And later they completely fabricated the story. They said that I was the one who assaulted him. And started ranting about how I lack morals and deserved to be beaten. They had a function in their house. There were a lot of workers, and all of them are saying the same thing that I was the one who attacked him. 

I want to register a police complaint. But my parents are against it. They say since we have no witnesses, the assailant may lodge a case against me and ruin my career. Is there anything I can do except just letting it go ?

It has a fr\*cking 9 on IMDB, a 90% rating on bookmyshow at 2 locations I went to (in Karnataka) and most newspaper / media reviews have given it 3 or higher. I saw the movie about a week ago, and just wanted to understand from what angle is it being considered a good movie - here is basically the crux of the movie:

1. The hero is basically invulnerable. Full stop. There is no living organism in the universe that can take on this guy. Bullets don't hurt him, anything thrown at him just bounces off of him, and he can basically floor 100 guys at once by letting out a fart. When a hero is made like this, there is no need to write anything else in the script, because basically there is no sense of tension - ""Oh, he has to penetrate the 5-layer security grid at the Pentagon? No problem, he can just walk across and crush all the drones and F-16 fighters with his pinky finger"". ""Oh, he has to defeat an entire alien horde from Europa? No problem, he'll just jump, reach outer space and blow some air in their general direction and they'll all crumble instantly"" - basically, there is no need to think about whether he will be successful or not, because it is already pre-determined that he will be.
2. He is a shameless eve-teaser. He walks into a girl's party drunk, whistles and catcalls her, stalks her, traps her in a hotel room, then kidnaps her by stealing her car. Despite this she falls for him because he picked up a bun from the street and gave it to a poor lady, who could easily have done it herself as cars will stop for you in India if you walk on the street. After this, he goes to a bar, watches an item song where he gropes other girls in front of her and the girl is supposed to be impressed by this.
3. There are a few elements around inclusivity and gender equality but they are so shamelessly ham-fisted that it's more cringey than redeeming. It's like someone told the director that ""Saar we just got a call from headquarters and they say that today's movies need to include some complicated technology called secularism, inclusivity, gender equality and tolerance. We don't know what these things mean, so we will outsource it to some intern to research and let him suggest a few sequences where these newfangled things are shown."" So they add a female editor who shouts at a few people to show that she is female and strong, then they throw in a few Muslim characters who are shown to be sympathetic and non-violent, throw in a namaz sequence or two, and their ""diversity, inclusiveness and tolerance"" quota is done.

The script is super-weak. The male lead has no flaws and is invulnerable. The female character (also called the 'female lead' for some reason) shows up for 2 seconds just to be the lapdog of the hero, and has no role in the movie. The entire movie is just glorifying stone-age traditions of patriarchy and eve-teasing and showing females as slaves to male fantasies. So how is this trending #1 as the ""best movie ever"", and if this is the mindset of the population that this kind of a movie is glorified as the ""best movie ever"", then how the fuck is this country supposed to move into the modern age? How can we blame politicians and bureaucrats for stonewalling progress when we as a nation have the mindset of cavemen?",,ad6wev,,0,,false,1552597639,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,AskIndia,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/ad6wev/eli5_the_hype_around_kgf_being_hailed_as_the_best/,,,false,AskIndia,

I am 19 and my mom is suffering from depression and bipolar and she kept physically and mentally abusing me for years and beaten me so much my blood boils every time I think about it, but still took care of her as she is my mom.

But last year things started to go over the top as she said that I am trying to kill her and I am having sex with my sister which resulted in me slapping my mom and I feel horrible since then.

My father and sister are just a bunch of manipulative assholes who always pretend that they are the victims and if anything goes wrong I am the reason for it.

Now my father is pressuring me to marry a girl saying that no one is going to marry me due to my moms depression.

I actively avoid making new friends and  I swear if anyone in my family died I will not shed a tear.

I have gone through so much abuse that I am now slipping into depression myself.

Edit: My mother is on medication from a military hospital but she doesn't accept that is suffering from bipolar.

Edit3: i confronted my mom and dad about the physical abuse right now to which they replied they did it to teach me a lesson.I kid you not they have beaten me from class 3 and so badly  that I was unable to move properly for days and my mistake was that I went to park without telling them for 1 hour and this is one of many instance I remember.

Support from relatives is not possible because they think we are just bunch of rich guys having family issues and they only think about the money I am going to inherit from my family.

so yesterday near 7.30 my father left our house for some interviews and book my tickets to go back to give my exams. now i talked to him yesterday before 8 and my mother talked to him at 8 and he told us that he's going to see company near (our city) and thats when we heard from him last time.

we tried to call him almost every 15 minutes and we are getting in marathi ""aap jis number pe pochneka prayatna kar rahe hain we abhi kavrag kshatra ke bahar hain"" (the number you are trying to reach is outside coverage area). same for whats app.

is there anyway we can track him current location via sim card or any app ?

this not the first time he did something like this, just few days ago he did something like this but in the early morning eh told us that hes in some village in karnataka and hes coming back to mumbai in few hours and he did. this time its over 12 hours since we heard from him. we think that issue this time is money as i am not sure but i think that instead of paying for my fees he spend it elsewhere and now he left as i cant give my exams which is in next week without paying my due fees.

&amp;#x200B;

so after waiting for over 36 hours without any contact we filed FIR today and they told us that the officer who will track his phone and do all the inquiry will start from tomorrow. we are planning to visit police station tomorrow evening to see what they got and if they were able to trace his phone/last location. they took one big photo alongside 7-8 pass port size photos and xrox copies of his pan card and Adhar card.  they told us that the report written on white paper-sheet(Print) is the FIR and wrote some bits of that on some other book.

&amp;#x200B;

on side note, we contacted my father last time when he was on xxx railway station, is there anyway we can see the CCTV footage of railway station/platform based on this situation ?

Worse thing is my mother have Low BP and diabetes as well, is there anyway we can keep her BP in control during this time ?

Edit :

Thank you guys, I am getting supporting messages and replies but I can't reply to all Right Now.

I find it extremely sad that colourism isn't discussed as much as religion, subethnicity, caste, language, etc. Dark women across the country are treated as if they're destined to be ugly and unwanted. Even in Tamil Nadu, where the Dravidian leaders take so much pride in their non-Aryan dark skin and do boast many prominent dark-skinned lead actors, their lead actresses are almost always light-skinned and most probably hail from North India. I guess their preferences on women aren't so Dravidian after all. 

Coming back to the original point, when will it be acceptable for an Indian woman who's extremely dark to be a heroine, instead of just some villain in a drama show?

I am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.

It's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. 

Does my period really make me so impure?

Edit: Thank you for all the love and support! I honestly didn't know this was that big of a problem until you people pointed it out. Especially the not eating thing. I didn't know it can have long term effects. The problem with that is that if I force my mother to let me eat then she will make me stay in that hell disgusting room for whole 2 days.

&amp;#x200B;

**Overview of the incidents**:

1. While walking down the street holding her boyfriends hand, a teenage boy reached out and groped one girls breasts. The couple stopped to confront the boy and the boy fled laughing.  This same girl was groped by boy on a motorcycle passing by with his friends less than 100m down the road. The boyfriend slapped the man for his sexual assault on his girlfriend. A bunch of local men stood by and no one offered to help.
2. One girl in our group was groped by a man passing by while she was out looking for dinner. When confronted, the man just shrugged it off like this was normal acceptable behaviour. 
3. Another girl in our group had a man 'brush' his hand against her groin while she was walking down the street. When confronted the man seemed to not care. 
4. Another girl was verbally harassed by some teenage boys on a motorbike outside her hotel. She was too scared to go out for dinner. 
5. A Tuk Tuk driver put his hand on a passengers leg for an extended period of time and consistently made inappropriate jokes about one of the girls. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we're asking - Is this normal for Jaipur? Are we safe to walk around the streets alone? Why is it that everywhere else we've been in India we've only encountered kindness, support and respect. Is this some cultural glitch for the region? Is there other areas in India we need to be worried for our safety?

Essentially, how an uneducated maid outsmarted a housing authority, the police, my parents, and myself.","The first half of the weirdest incident of my life can be found here. https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aw069d/parents_fired_their_maid_and_now_they_believe_she/?

TL:DR My parents fired our maid for organizing other maids against a new rule passed by the housing authority that maids cannot sit on benches. Since then strange acts of vandalism have been happening, but no one can connect them to her or even knows where she is.

 ########

Okay so basically I left my home to stay with my parents because they’ve become very frightened by the vandalism facing them. I decided to speak to the housing authority office to inform them about this (my parents told them by phone, I went to see them personally). There I learned that they’ve been having issues as well. Someone has been leaving letters for them that contain photos of their homes, which irked them. But they had no clue why.

When they heard my parents issues they suddenly realized it was probably the same maid trying to intimidate them. Though a complaint had already been lodged with the police, we decided to go together to lodge another one that the housing authority was at risk (to get police security). The police said we’ll post security, but recommended we visit the police station that the maid resided in to see if she has a police record. Unfortunately, the maid agency she came from has a strict rule about no revealing such details to protect employees and would only do so if police asked. Luckily, a maid of a neighbor said the maid came from x-location (a sort of slum area). When we visited the police station is fell under, the police did not have her name on record. He asked if we have a photo, and we showed her a photo we had (the housing authority takes an ID photo of all maids and similar staff who enter the building). When he saw it he started laughing, he took the housing authority manager’s phone (which contained the pic) and showed the photo to one lady officer who was there. She sighed and said “what dramabazzi has she started now?”.

Apparently, she gave us a fake name. She is known to the police for years now, but not as a criminal. But as an “agitator”. She first became known to police after organizing a project in her area, that whenever a police should enter our neighborhood at least 2 people should be recording their actions. This was due to issues of police brutality against adivasis and slum dwellers. Any incidents are immediately shared to a WhatsApp group she manages. Because of this police have to be on their best behaviour when entering those areas. She also apparently runs a podcast type show (sent via WhatsApp) where she discusses practical information for slum dwellers (how to get govt. documents, your civil rights etc.) in an Adivasi language (since many Adivasi have poor Hindi and 0 English). She also launched boycott of a shopkeeper who said racist things to adivasis and only ended it after giving a public apology which was also shared via social media. She organized a cultural festival and feast as well, and invited local non adivasis to it as a kind of communal harmony event.

The craziest thing she apparently did, was during a recent state election she took money from multiple parties under the promise she would deliver attendees to their political rallies. Then did not deliver a single attendee. When they demanded the money back she supposedly blackmailed them. Though it’s unsure with what information, or how she got this information. However the police confirm she did accept their money for sure. She consistently uses fake documents and names as well, making her difficult to track.  

Just a reminder all this was going on while she worked as my parents maid.

The housing authority manager asked if she was a naxal. The police said no, if she was someone would have been hurt or worse by now. The police said, having observed her actions for years now, she is probably doing this to intimidate you into lifting the bench ban. We asked if he could take action, he said maybe, but the resources needed to find her (she is probably hiding somewhere outside the city) don’t justify the damage caused. Also your bench ban could erupt into a civil rights issue and the police don’t want to be tied to it. He told us that, that we will file a case against her to, and be on the lookout, but warned that she will probably consistently escalate the pressure against us.

I asked how’s it possible she can do all this being from such a poor not educated background. He responded education and intelligence are totally separate. The internet removed the information and communication barrier, and those who were once locked out of the mainstream are going to force their way in, whether they were invited or not.

Leaving the police station, I got into an argument with what to do next with the housing authority manager. I told him to drop the bench ban (I never supported this to start with), he said we’ll add more security. Eventually he relented considering the cost of all the added security and the stress was not worth it. The bench ban was removed as of today.

Let’s see if this satisfied the maid and makes her drop her intimidation campaign.
