Although my budget is around 5k(which is obviously low and can stretch a bit), I'd just like to know what brands are usually recommended and how they are, against the helmets in the 2k price ranges(steelbird, Vega etc).

I've been using a Vega helmet for 5 years and I decided its time to upgrade since I travel 40km daily and need some decent safety. Scratch resistant visor would be great, even if its a add on.

So far, only MT and Axxis are available in a spartan pro gear(only exclusive riding gear) shop near me, kinda afraid the normal shops are selling dupes and inflated pricing.

1551618967.0,3,63,23,"So my roommate is Indian. She is from a village in Haryana. We share a bathroom and she doesn't wash her hands with soap. I am pretty much a germaphobe and I constantly clean the bathtub and the sink with domestos. However, I can not go around disinfecting everything that she touches!
We've been roommates since September, and I spoke to her about this then. We bought a liquid soap and I though she would be washing her hands. When I left home and came back after 2 months, I saw that there was no soap (there was very little when I left) and basically yeah.
Also, in autumn she told me that she doesn't use toilet paper, but her English is so bad that she tried to explain something and then just changed the topic. So I guess she uses water to clean poop. Them I'm worried how she does it because we don't have a bidet. In the bathtub? Fuck, it's disgusting. But I don't even know how to ask that. Just tell her - hey do you wash your butt in the tub after defecating?
I simply can not explain to her that she has to wash her hands after pooping! She told me that in India they didnt even have water and my guess would be that they didnt even have a toilet. What do I do? I was thinking about simply confronting her and saying - ""hey you need to wash your hands, it's disgusting that you don't do it"". Another issue is that she has a tiny little piece of ayurvedic soap which she doesn't use at all, but she will claim she has soap and she uses it. 
Weirdly, she has all the shower stuff and takes bath regularly, but she doesn't wash her fucking hands!
Idk if it's a cultural thing but I don't care even if it is. It's basic hygiene rules. I just have no idea how to make her do that.

Last year I made on post on this subreddit(https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8y7far/starting_college_at_25/). 
So yeah I took admission in IGNOU this year in January. Have filled couple of forms for SSC CHSE and going to fill form for RRB MUMBAI for railway posts.
For past 4 to 5 months I have been too depressed. I have been feeling so behind. Thinking about future is constantly giving me shakes every night. I constantly wake up at night due to my never ending thoughts. Can't seem to get back to sleep. 
I keep feeling ashamed of myself. I can't even maintain eye contacts with my parents. 
I basically have no friends since last 2 years. I feel isolated and cut of from world. Never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and the only women  I have ever casually talked with is my mother and my cousins.
Since past 4 to 5 months I have been so depressed that I have started chain-smoking. I lie to mother everyday that I'm going to meet friends while in reality I'm out smoking alone. I don't know if I even have a future. Watching all the young people getting jobs, having time of their life, having a relationship, makes me feel even more miserable.

I am also not in good shape. For most of my life I have been an underweight. At 25 I only weigh 56 kgs. I constantly feel depressed that not only I don't have a career but I also don't look good. Every night I am getting panic attacks. Feels like getting a heart attack.

I have an older brother. He passed engineering from an good govt college. Did MBA from IIM. Earns 1.6 lpm. And here I am his pathetic brother who is no good at anything. I feel so ashamed just looking at him. I don't even deserve to be called his brother.

When I made post last year, reading all the comments, I felt good for a while. Felt like I was going to get my life on track. But I feel scared now. Am losing my confidence. Even smallest task like talking to someone feels like dread is looming over me.

1. I posted this on r/pakistan last night, I think r/india might also be a good place to hear opinions
2. The tl;dr is at the bottom in bold

So I'm eighteen and a senior in American high school. I lived in Pakistan until I was seven, and I didn't even realize until after I left, that India and Pakistan had/have bad relations.

But anyway my school is mostly made up of white, black, and hispanic people, however I always noticed this one girl who was Indian, and I didn't notice her because we're the same race, but because she's loud as hell. All the other South Asian kids at our school are quiet and reserved.

Today I got switched into a culinary class, and that Indian girl was sitting inside the classroom. She's not apart of the class, she just sits in there because that's her lunch period and the teacher likes her, I guess.

Since she's not in the class I asked her to watch my phone, and after I finished my work I sat near her to get to know her since I thought we could relate to each other, because like I said South Asian kids are rare in my school. Plus, we're the same grade and we're both girls.

We got along well and I guess she assumed I was from India too, because at one point she said

""You're like, the only other Indian bitch at this school who has a personality.""

I laughed and told her I was actually from Pakistan. She said ""Oh"" and stopped talking to me all of a sudden.

I saw her at the end of the day and tried to say hi to her, but she shrugged me off very hastily so I don't think we're friends anymore, not that I really care.

I don't get it. We were getting along fine, but as soon as she found out I was Pakistani and not Indian she got angry at me, as if I can control where I was born.

I guess she's just really in touch with her Indian intolerance. She said a lot of judgy things about gays and muslims, too, which is odd for an eighteen-year-old Americanized chick to rant about.

I don't think she would have made a good friend anyways.

I will be going to a pet shop for their milks, would be great if you guys recommend something and some tips on what should I do. 

Thanks! 

Edit: I asked some other local guys and they said these were born last Monday and their mom has been raising them until yesterday. Last night she died. Again I can't verify if they are true or not since not sign of any dead body here. So they are 1 week old. 

My sister called a vet and she said to give them amul spray, I'll be going out to get some Royal canin dog milk supplement or something similar. 

and we don't plan to keep them. We'll probably give them away for adoption.

This was the most disappointing news for a lot of us teenagers and youth. Albeit these disappointments, soon BBM and later WhatsApp took over IM’s and now majority of people are not concerned about the 100 SMS limit anymore. Now, Communication is even more effective through these means. (Does MMS ring any bells? Look where WhatsApp got us now)

Whereas now, TRAI revised the channel subscription plan which gave an impression that it’ll work out cheaper than current packages, but it isn’t (as per my experience). 
With rigorous planning and downsizing from unlimited channels pack to limited channels pack, for the new amount that I’m about to pay currently I would rather use it on IPTV or online streaming services. 

Online streaming services are on the rise right now in India according to some random stats that I came across in the internet. Assuming majority of the population in urban areas, users have access to high speed internet and subscribe to online streaming services. 
We can save money on tv plans and rather invest in existing online services  and rely on internet instead of satellite broadcast (not entirely eliminate it though).  And moreover does the cost involved in broadcasting content via internet be cheaper than satellite??

The dots that I’ve tried to connect is; 
“Is the history repeating itself with TRAI (the shift to internet)? Does this mean we are going to experience less of dish tv experience and more of IPTV/online streaming services in the future?” 

What are your thoughts? Are there any different angles to this scenario?

1. Some bank ATMs (HDFC, Axis) say the card is blocked/invalid and some ATMs (SBI, ICICI) accept it normally.

2. The card fails to work with 90% POS terminals. The chip doesn't work, and when the stripe is used as a secondary way, it says use chip. Sometimes, it'll go upto the PIN phase and then decline transaction, with more than enough balance available to cover the transaction.

So, at Pooja the things I saw, I thought were pretty funny. First the normal mantras., then priest told them to drop coins gradually near Lord lakhsmis portrait.
Next breaking a coconut near machinery, turmeric powder on them, flowers near the service station, breaking a pumpkin, cutting a lemon, pouring rice, and putting rice around the premises.

All this was happening and I thought it was funny how people believe all this, I mean did the priest have a manual for all this to prove that the machine or business will work better?

And I was also offended because these guys belittle the scientific achievements we had but make money on those all the same. How the machine came to fruition doesn't matter all that matters is if the priest did his job.

If there is a very intelligent kid in 3rd grade who finishes the syllabus of 5th grade via digital lessons due to his high IQ and interest, what is the need of forcing him to attend classes and lectures in schools and colleges so that he has to listen to the lectures of a teacher that tells things that he has already learnt? Isn't that a waste of time? He can utilize such time to learn something new instead. What is the need of enforcing minimum attendence on such kid? Why don't we create an education system where the knowledge and integrity of a kid is tested after every 6 months which he has to pass. After that, there would be no need for him to attend any lessons and he can gain new knowledge and skills according to his own comfort.

If this is the essence of homeschooling, then what is wrong in it? Why does not state establish knowledge centres in every city where the student learns things at his own pace via structures lessons on a computer/laptop?

Edit 1 : So I think that homeschooling is not a good idea. The problem can be solved by two provisions in education system. 

First, studying through digital lessons in separate computer labs for kids who feel they do not belong to the culture and IQ of their classmates.We shall never force such kids to change their pace and method of study just for the sake of socialising.

I bring to you the case of my housemaid. A very sweet single mom who cooks and cleans for a living here in Delhi.

I've been talking to her and I realize that she doesn't have a single identity document. She would very much like to remedy this situation but doesn't know where to start. 

She has no bank account, in order to make one she needs an ID document which she doesn't have. I took her to the post office to make her an Aadhaar card but the officers there asked for a birth certificate or a school certificate or a voter's ID. She has absolutely nothing. She has never been to school and has been living paycheck to paycheck. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her estranged husband had a bank account with SBI and she still has the passbook but it doesn't have her name on it. She also has kids who went to school for a few years and they also have some papers but her name doesn't appear on them.

&amp;#x200B;

She lives in a small apartment that she rents but her name is not on any of the utility bills. I'm guessing we can get an letter from the landlord as proof of address but I don't know where to go from there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Surely, the government must have some provision for such people who are out of the system? I am sure she is not the only one and it's such a vicious cycle to be stuck in.

My parents, sent her to Kota for IIT prep at Bansal classes. Developed home sickness and depression, could not cope up with studies, and my parents were forced to cancel the classes and bring her back. Appointed psychiatrist, medication started. Meanwhile re-admitted to the same school for class 11 and 12. My parents dead set wanted her to do IIT and had her take some local institutes. She was so much focussed on IIT that she messed up her class 11 school marks, but passed, and also secured &gt;80% in class 12 boards. Meanwhile her mental condition was deteriorating and mending repeatedly and active change in medication. Gave AIEEE, did not make it.. My dad was disappointing. Got admitted in Kurukshetra University instead for B.Tech in Instrumentation. Mental condition again began going downhill, add it to terrible home sickness and ragging, she went completely crazy in her second year, She was causing unrest among her roommates, refused to take medication and tore apart her *suraksha kawach*(my dad is a strong superstitious and religious person). 

Again my parents brought her back and appointed another doctor in Delhi. She skipped a year. Resumed Uni after a year and graduated. Also got two job offers from campusing. She agreed on IBM and her training began in 2017 in Bangalore. Not even 6 months and again home sickness to the point that she resigned and came back home despite my parents and even me telling her to atleast think twice. 

Now I think my dad is to blame for some part. He was stubborn, violent and did not listen to anybody. He was extremely religious and superstitious. He also maintained a fake image before others. Spent WAY TOO less money(I consider myself upper middle class), and rarely he would take us to trips or spend on some new clothes. I mean maybe once in every 3 years... His behavior has definitely gotten better in recent years, maybe because I am bit rebellious as compared to my sister.

Fast forward to present, she is 24, and just sitting around in house, obese, no future plans, not willing to even do household chores. Mental situation has got much better but now she is just unwilling to do anything. Tried to get a bank job previous year but failed the interviews. Not listening to anybody not even the doctor. Now being a struggling class 11 myself I cannot give much time to her. Parents have already given up hope and thinking about marrying her off. To make situation worse my father is retiring later this year

1548784978.0,3,11,13,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

Hugging, touching, and generally showing that they love their buddies seems to be the norm and not looked upon in a negative light or seen as “gay” in nature. I’m coming from a western idea of bromance and masculinity. Men have become more comfortable with showing affection towards each other, but we’re still plagued with the “no homo” attitude if men hug or show other signs of affection at times. In a lot of photos of Indian friends, males make hearts with their hands or use lovey, “feminine” emojis and I’m just curious as to how masculinity and male friendship is viewed in India with comparison to the west. It doesn’t seem like the gay hysteria is as strong, or at least, men hand in hand does not = gay in India. 

Culturally, what is different about male friendships and masculinity in India, along with displays of affection? How are gay people viewed? What *does* make someone appear to be “gay”?

Does anyone know how I can take money out of a Paytm account ?

Backstory : Nobody in my family accepts Paytm ( none of use it , and only my mom has an account).

So while my mom refuses to accept payments on Paytm, this one lady sent it to her and now my mom's account has ~600 rupees in it. 

Trouble is Paytm is refusing to let us use that money because no KYC has been done. We really don't want to get a KYC done with Paytm because it was asking us to open an account with Paytm bank - which is something which all of us are dead against.

Is there a solution to this ?

P.S. one thing we thought was to link it to uber and use up the money in uber rides, but I'm not sure if that's going to work.

So, an elderly member of my family just received an email blackmailing him to send $800. The content of the email was this:

1. In the first line of the email, the blackmailer mentioned a password, which was one time used by my acquaintance, but now is defunct. This was what made the email stand out from other  spam messages.
2. Then they mention that my acquaintance had visited a pornographic website, ""xxx videos"" and that blackmailer had made a ""video"" of the event and has access contacts in FB, Messenger and ""e-mailaccount"". 
3. Then they threaten to send the video (of the video he was watching and also him watching the video) to all the contacts unless he pays  to a bitcoin account.
4.  They mention not to contact the authorities as they have covered their steps and won't be traceable. 

My acquaintance uses an old windows 7 laptop and has a decent free antivirus protection. And what takes the cherry is that he has put sticker on the webcam of the laptop. He read an article in the newspaper advising him to do so. LOL. But might have ""inadvertently"" clicked on a pop-up/email for a porn re-direct, which he claims he closed. This happened sometime in the past.

From the stand point of his laptop, what can we check for? Ran the antivirus which did not reveal anything alarming. Based on his best guess, he might have used this password on IRCTC website. Which might explain how the blackmailer got his registered email and password. Maybe the IRCTC accounts have been hacked, but this is just a guess at this stage.

More than anything, my acquaintance is livid that he has been targeted for a blackmail like this and is considering going to the police. He's not concerned about the ""video"" per se. Going by the email address, the weblink for the bitcoin ransom, would the police be able to trace the blackmailer? 

Please let me know your thoughts on this and maybe also have a chat with oldies/less tech savvy members of your family about general internet security. I've just done mine. :)

1) Since I have 0 experience till now, what condom do you suggest? I read about the delay condoms but reviews stated they aren't good. 

2) To get drunk or not to get drunk before making out.

3) Anything else that you think I should know.

1548154403.0,3,19,16,"I had to meet a school classmate of mine at a food joint, it's been ages since we caught up. So I ride up to the place on my bike and the place is real busy. I see no parking signs on the street however there is room available in front of the building renting the food placee for bike parking. The curb in front of the building doesn't have a ramp but the side of the building on the smaller side road does ( this is a corner building with a main road on the front and a side road on the left ).  Anyway there was a car parked blocking the side entrance and as a result lot of bikes were parked on the side street. I make a couple of circles tying to find a spot with no luck, doubling down to squeeze through I somehow managed to squeeze between the car and a tree to get through and park my bike in front of the building. ( So this is not on the footpath but the space between that and the building. )

Went about my lunch we had a great time catching up. I was in a good mood, time to part and I get on my bike to go home while my friend walked off the side road. 

So the building has an unmarked business?! shop!? I don't know what it was but had one of those office like doors put in with a window. This office is in the basement of the building. As I'm getting the bike out this lady sees me from the window rushes out and proceeds to command me ""Next time you come here, I don't want you parking there!"" . It took me a second to understand what she was saying. Not wanting to deal with her I shrug my shoulders and ignore here. This set her off, blew her lid off. She proceeds to repeat and add that parking is not allowed here. I did point out there arnt any No Parking signs on this place. She says "" that does not matter, there is no parking here"". I insist on the point and point to I'm here that on I'm not encroaching on private property, it like has a chain fence like short wall and I was outside that. She keeps ignoring what I'm saying and insists on the no parking adding "" this is a business, how can we do business if there are parked bikes in front of it"". I mean lady, come on! First I'm not even obstructing your business entrance, second your business doesn't even have any signs, who in the world would look at something like that and even guess that there's a legit business there.

  


I had enough of here, I asked her to call the cops if she has a problem. Pissed off she storms in, comes back and prooceeds to slam shut the door of her own business.

  


With all this said Am I the Asshole for doing what I did? The whole thing bothered me for a couple days.

  


tldr: park in a legit spot in front of a building, lady owning a business in the building proceeds to command me like she's my mom, we exchange words with her slamming the door of her own business and me end up bothered by it for next few days

1553934038.0,3,6,9,"So I called my accountant today to ask whether 44ADA would be used when filing my tax returns this year, because we used it in 2017. Since my income was (and is) over the 2,50,000 limit but under the 5,00,000 limit, I did not have to pay any taxes. However, I did not file a tax return in 2018 as my income was waaaay under the limit.  I've read that you can't use 44ADA if you don't use it once (e.g. you used it in 2004 but didn't use it in 2005, so you can't use it in 2006) but I'm not sure if this means using some other IT form instead of ITR4S/44ADA OR not filing a return at all. Which is what I asked my accountant. All she says is I don't know. 

My mum and I are the only directors in an LLP (not really doing anything though - revenue is what, like, 30k and expenses are the same) and file everything that is necessary for it. Mum has retired and only has FD income. Now, me and mum had not included the LLP's income and expenses or its name in our previous IT returns for 2017 and 2018 (the LLP was incorporated in early 2017); this was done on the accountant's recommendation as she said there was no need to do that.  There was NO income at all in 2017 for the LLP, just expenses. 

My income this year is 4,52,000, and it is essential that I use 44ADA so I don't have to pay tax as I've already paid 7500 as professional taxes for NOTHING for my LLP, mum, and me..for LITERALLY NOTHING. We don't draw an income from the LLP, and her monthly income is only from bank FDs, not from a salary or wage. Paid that money for literally ZERO relevant income, just because. 

My accountant refused to comment on what my personal tax liability could be or whether we would even use this (44ADA) again...despite already having paid her for the LLP and a part of the fees for our IT returns! She says she has to process everything, which I understand, but like, what am I paying an accountant for then if you can't even give me an answer? 

Damn it, I just want to know what my tax liability will be. We have no investments or anything of the sort so I really don't see why she can't give me a straight answer as I know that if you have capital gains, 44ADA cannot be used. I'm considering changing accountants but I've already paid her a good part of the fees.

&amp;#x200B;

Could someone please help me out?

&amp;#x200B;

It occurred to me last night that we have a growing scene of youtubers in India and I kinda follow quite a few of them. But none of them actually have the content of random facts, science info that I usually watch on the English channel. For example, I know shit-ton about the Great Pyramid of Giza and a few facts that  I think are not really well known and it would be a good idea to introduce our new hindi-speaking people to the random facts to help them understand how to waste their lives too.

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't know is, how do I create these videos. For example, if you look at this video -&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko-ZboCzR64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko-ZboCzR64) , its fucking fantastic. I am an IT guy myself but I have never worked outside of a Linux terminal. I am guessing I need to learn ""Adobe premier pro"" here?

The question is, what tools do I need to learn? I just don't want to go down the rabbit-hole of the overwhelming information available online just to realize later that I needed to learn something else. Look at that youtube video that I linked, I would like to be able to create something like that.

I am 30 years old and I have only recently started making enough money that I can start saving and investing. I am new to investing and have done some research on mutual funds, PPF, etc.

Here are a few things -
* 1. I can invest/save around Rs.10,000/- per month, maybe even stretch it to Rs.15,000/-. (Edit: On second thought, there is no reason I cannot invest Rs.15k per month considering I have very few expenses.
* 2. I do not fall into the bracket of taxable income - as of now, my income is not subject to IT since it falls within the exemption limit of 5L.
* 3. I do not have any financial obligations such as rent, groceries, etc. since I live with my parents who are financially independent. My only expenditures are my own cellphone bills, going out with friends, etc.
* 4. I have health insurance cover of 5L
* 5. I know that financial goals are very important in determining what kind of instruments one should invest in, but as of now, my only goal is to save money for the future.

Emergency Fund - I have read that when it comes to saving, one should start with an emergency fund, and that sounds like good advice to me. What are the best options to set up an emergency fund which is liquid in nature? The few options that I know of are - RD, Savings Schemes of various financial institutions that give ~6-7% RoI but with some risk, or just park it in a different Savings Bank account and hide the ATM card? What would be a good amount to set aside every month for the emergency fund?

PPF - Being a long term and safe investment that would give a steady rate of 8% CI, is it a good investment in the day and age of mutual funds which give you more than 10% RoI? Especially since tax saving u/s 80C is not my goal right now and I can afford to park my funds in other places.

SIP/Mutual Funds - What are some good mutual funds one can invest in? And how long should I be parking my funds in it? I’d like to invest in SIPs since I don’t have a large enough corpus to invest right now. 

Tools to invest - Most of all, what are the best tools to use for investing and savings? There are many apps out there like ETMoney, PayTM Money, etc. Which ones do you recommend and why?

I understand that I am very late to the game and I should start investing aggressively for the future.

I wanted to buy a new carrom board for home. After searching online for which is the best carrom brand / board in India, I came to know about an online shop that sells good carrom boards.

The model that I ordered (Precise Elegant Bulldog Carrom board, 24 mm, Price Rs. 7749) was delivered to our place in Bangalore in few days. I was so happy before unboxing the packing, curious about what's so special about such an expensive board.

I even made an unboxing video. Immediately while unboxing we observed that board's frame/cushion had 3 cracks. One of the cracks was so severe that it reached near the playing surface.

I sent the unboxing video to shop owner. Had a length discussion with him. According to him - 

1. It's unfortunate that the board is damaged. It was sent in mint condition, the courier guys must have dropped it.
2. The defects are minor, it won't affect playing. 
3. They cannot replace the board because as per ""their policy"" they won't replace if there is no issue with the playing area. \[BTW, this policy is not mentioned anywhere on their website\]
4. I should try to fix it with feviquick.
5. I should ""consider"" the fact that already they have given a ""discounted"" product, if customer buys from another shop/online store it will cost Rs. 11,000
6. I should play on the board and see if the playing area is okay.

\---

After this I tested the playing area of the board. Due to the crack near middle of one side, the rebound was not coming properly. I made this video and sent it to him \[Link to video in comments\]

Below is our discussion over call with him after sending the video \[link in comments\]

According to him, it is nobody's fault that they board got damaged! We should pay the return courier charges if we want replacement. The board weighs 25kg, it will be costly affair to send it to Mumbai from Bangalore.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my wife are both frustrated. Having spent so much on a defective board. Had the board been available on Amazon or some other online store with decent return policy, we would have ordered from there.

The second closest is Espanol with 1.6 million. It leads to reason that most of the internet exists in English or at the very least in the Latin alphabet.

What's life like when you can only read in Hindi? For example, on [NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-strikes-terrorist-camp-across-line-of-control-say-reports-official-details-awaited-1999291), in a field of English you can see one small link allowing you to read the article in Hindi. Are you more prone to using websites that have Hindi translation options?

What are the differences between accessing the web in Hindi than in English? For example, I imagine Dainik Jagran shows up as a news source much before anything else, right? Because as an English reader, I don't see Dainik Jagran at all on my Google search results for news - unless I'm searching for local news in the Hindi belt. 

I imagine that most Indian internet users today are accessing in languages not English. Was just curious as to the experience. It must mean a totally different site-set than us english users, but it can also mean that the experience is different as well. Do you feel forced to use English websites or does Google translate function effectively? And do people have the Google translate extension enabled by default all the time?

Serious replies only please, I'm going through a dark phase.

EDIT:

A lot of commentators asked for details, so here,

I didn't want to dive into them, it's very long and very triggering, which is why I kept it vague. I don't like being invalidated because I didn't explain it right and that just adds to the problem. It's a long chain.

In short, I have a long history (14-15 years) of daily sexual /really harsh physical abuse by my mother. Yes. I can't even begin do describe how harrowing it was, and how long it took me to realize the extent of damage it caused. 

This is the simplest part and actual issues are far more intricate. Things have never been normal. I do look normal, I mask it well. Had a successful career which tanked when these symptoms became worse. 

Haven't worked in last 5 years. Really unstable for day to day continuity. I'm in a good marriage, which is probably why I'm not dead. Stability is very important for my mental health, but I'm getting evicted for the second time in 2 years. Don't want to get into how it happened or legal aspects because everything that can be done has been done. And it may not be something very big but I'm at my wits end to what assholes people can be.

I have no one besides my wife to take care of this. And she had her own limitations. Money is tight.

On January 10, 2019, following up on reports of network interferences to proxy and VPN websites from Reddit and a story in Quartz India we made an [**online reporting form**](https://internetfreedom.in/more-than-100-people-report-violations-of-net-neutrality-all-over-india-we-need-enforcement-action/proxy%20and%20VPN%20websites) for users to report such instances. A summary of the reports is provided below and a data sheet has also been made available available as we seek further data and request for collaboration from the wider net neutrality community in India as we continue pushing for enforcement.

## Summary of reports

1. A total of 134 reports have been provided to us from the different cities and states spread across evenly over a 2 week reporting period. These include reports from major metropolitan cities and as well as smaller towns such as Siliguri, Udupi and Mindapur. We can reasonably infer this is a pan India problem.  
2. The reports primarily arise from users of mobile internet users (64.4%). They are concentrated across two telecom operators which also have licenses to provide internet services. These are Reliance Jio with approximately 85 complaints and Airtel with 41 complaints. Other telcos and ISPs which also find mention are, ACT Fibernet, BSNL, Vodafone and Hathway.  
3. The reports on blocking of proxy and VPNs are concentrated for Jio. These include detailed statements which go beyond the blocking of pornographic websites or domains which may be blocked by interim injunctions by orders of courts.  Most reports on Airtel conflate the blocking of pornographic websites but also state that it is blocking the Telegram domain (different from the usage of the app, or its download through an App store).  

A version of the form which redacts the personal details of the respondents is [**available here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5ToesR8HCcH6bmP_s7s5jN6YlYw4t4l-ovCpmY7xyc/edit#gid=1822363676).

## Preliminary Inferences

1. Users are generally not aware of the reasons for network interference with websites and internet services in India. There are no clear statements or information available on the reason which may emerge from any legal order that is made available to them. They also are left wondering if this fault may be caused due to a technical error or may have commercial or regulatory interest attached to it. Further, there lacks any institutional process to gather or request such information in a standardised manner.
2. There is a lack of any data gathering or reporting mechanism available for complaints about blocking and throttling. Hence, in the absence of any such system users are left to correspond with the consumer helplines of telecom operators which lack the technical ability and the incentive to address issues of systemic, network interference. It is not publicly known whether such monitoring even takes place by the Department of Telecom or by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.  

## We need enforcement to #SaveTheInternet

The extent of the complaints and our analysis indicates the need to press demands for the enforcement of India’s net neutrality protections. We call on academics, activists, technologists, civil society groups, network engineers and those from the wider net neutrality community to help us collaborate with data and then press for enforcement.

Please do write to us, we would like to share your experience and work on net neutrality engagement since the regulations were made, share our learnings and data, and discuss policy and enforcement actions in the true spirit of collaboration.  Write to us as policy@internetfreedom.in

1550124529.0,5,8,100,"Thinking about the last time I got a valentines day letter takes me back to senior school. Around 2002, when the internet was around, but still not quite... everywhere. As the years rolled on, promises of a digital transformation emerged in sputters. I think I was not alone when I hoped that gigabytes of bandwidth could cure all ills. Fix our lives -- even larger social problems. Well, we are still not quite there.

But our lives are not quite the same.

In time, many of us have grown to not only use but love the free and open internet. But each day it is under threat. Take, for instance -- the ""Intermediary rules"". Any changes to them will impact all of us.

Think about the legal rules that govern your ISP (Airtel, Idea-Vodafone, Jio or others), or large social media platforms (Wikipedia, Github, Facebook, Sharechat, Youtube, Instagram, Twitter etc.), or even smaller start-up online services you use and enjoy (for me, it is IndianKanoon). Changes proposed to these rules not only massively change your online experience but also threaten your online privacy and free speech. 

**So how can you prevent these changes?**

* First, get to know about the Intermediary Rules. To make it easier, we have collaborated to create a video explainer. Yes, please do *youtube and chill* ([English version](https://youtu.be/TfMEOF3gL6g) / [Hindi Version](https://youtu.be/MCh835mOt3I%E2%80%8B)) 
* Second, tell the government to roll back these proposals. How? [Click on this link](https://internetfreedom.in/civil-society-and-research-organisations-are-unanimous-proposed-changes-to-intermediary-rules-must-be-recalled/) and follow three simple steps given at the end. 

These proposed changes illustrate the wider threats to our online freedom. To help win on these battles we need an organised fighting force for our civil liberties. This is where IFF comes in. This week we have rolled out a [membership plan](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/) to make you an integral part of our work. The Reddit Community has been a core supporter of our work and we continue to call on you to do more! Please do try it out, -- send it to any friends or family to sign up as well. It has a system of recurring donations and different membership tiers. We offer some benefits and promise to remain in constant touch.

As always, I invite you to explore [our work](https://internetfreedom.in/) and personally value any feedback. We are listening to you and we know you share our love for the free and open internet!

# Background

Back in 2016, the principles of Net Neutrality were established in India when the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India prohibited Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services. This effectively prohibited pricing and technical discrimination as offered Facebook’s Free Basics services. In 2018, TRAI further solidified net neutrality in its recommendations which the Department of Telecommunications adopted to make license amendments. However, there have been lasting concerns over the years that largely deal with lack of enforcement of these Rules. This brings us to the current day scenario where we have been witnessing rigorous website blocking by TSP/ISP’s with no legal justification. We have been updating you in our previous [**posts**](https://internetfreedom.in/what-the-block-our-net-neutrality-rules-require-a-monitoring-and-enforcement-structure/) of these rampant occurrences.

### ""The Present and Future of Net Neutrality in India""

The Centre for Communication Governance at NLU Delhi and the Internet Freedom Foundation organised an engaging discussion on “The Present and Future of Net Neutrality” this on March 14, 2019 (Thursday) at the India International Centre, Annexe. The reason behind organising such a gathering was to examine Net Neutrality's existing regulations and concerns but more importantly identify the necessary steps forward to protect the spirit and intent of net neutrality. The panellists comprised of experts from government, academia, civil society organisations and industry. Additionally, we have created a report summarising significant aspects of the discussion ([**Read here for more**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vCL0niT1AjiymaxLHHpibuitgCK2es_-/view?usp=sharing)).

### #SaveTheInternet

As we have explained, over the past few months, the Internet Freedom Foundation has focussed its efforts on identifying the violations of Net Neutrality through blocking of website access. It is in light of these current threats to net neutrality, it has taken the step to activate the [**SaveTheInternet.in**](https://savetheinternet.in/) website on March 18, 2019 at 8:00 AM.  
The website has been designed to move beyond email support for net neutrality to active petitioning. With a direct ""[**Take Action Petition**](https://savetheinternet.in/petition/)"" button, it provides individuals and organisations with the opportunity to show support to list of joint demands sent to the relevant government offices. We continue to make it possible for you to [**submit reports**](https://savetheinternet.in/report/) of any net neutrality violations to us.   
However, the buck does not stop there. We at IFF will continue to monitor violations as we have and to the best of our abilities will ensure the spirit of Net Neutrality is maintained in India. Through this data we will be armed to take advocacy actions, make formal complaints and ensure TRAI and DOT enforce the necessary enforcement mechanisms.

### Highlights

* *Context:* The Parliamentary Committee on IT has recently published a notice for a hearing on, ""*‘Safeguarding citizens’ data on social/online news media platforms’""* that will be held on February 11, 2019. This meeting invites representatives of Government and Twitter.
* *Broaden participation:* In line with our past representations when hearings were conducted on data breaches, privacy and to review the functioning of the UIDAI we are asking for greater public participation. This includes oral depositions by experts, academics, domain specialists, technologists and civil society groups.
* *Move towards outcomes:* We also indicate the need for the past hearings on these important subjects to lead towards outcomes. The mandate of the Parliamentary Committee on IT is to make recommendations to Parliment and the work and learnings gathered by depositions and submissions may perish if reports are not prepared and tabled before the next elections.

### Analysis

In continuation in continuation of our letters dated May 21, 2018, April 21, 2018 and April 5, 2018 and a formal memoranda and submissions we made on June 01, 2018 we continue to engage with the Parliamentary Committee on IT. We have today written to the Chairperson, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur and all the Hon'ble Members appreciating the vital role that is played by it in informing the lawmaking process issues of technology and human freedom.

[**Our letter dated February 7, 2019 to the Hon'ble Chairperson and members of the Committee on IT is available here.**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RBebpOEOri-DueBzn-Wxqa_-IAvzkOOt/view?usp=sharing)

In a digitally connected India the committee has assumed vital importance and held hearings on pressing controversies including, net neutrality; data protection and privacy; data breaches and the Cambridge Analytica scandal; and overviewed the functioning of the UIDAI. It's next meeting on February 11, 2019 comes after a representation of[ **allegations of bias of social media companies**](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/twitter-summoned-by-parliamentary-panel-after-anti-right-wing-accusation-1989447), specifically Twitter. Such hearings need to be broader and involve other platforms as well. But most importantly this hearing is correctly titled as, ""safeguarding citizens"" and we believe citizens should play a vital role in it. We believe the public, academic, civil society groups, domain experts and specialists are a vital component of this exercise. They need to be permitted the ability to make oral submissions which are right now restricted only to representatives of Government and Twitter.

Secondly, over the course of the past three years, the breadth of issues considered by the committee have been of vital public importance. However, any outcomes or recommendations which may form a report has not yet been made. As our board chair, Raman Chima has notes on the specific issue of data breaches and the Cambridge Analytica scandal,  ""*a final outcome of this Committee's deliberations on this important topic is also key, to ensure that Parliament remains relevant in how it seeks to protect privacy, rather than being overtaken by developments pushed by the executive and judicial branches of government.*""

We will continue to engage with the committee as firm believers in public victories which are possible through institutional engagement.

It's been a week since we re-activated SaveTheInternet.in. and we have received overwhelming support! Here is an update on the reports of website blocking over the last week.

Over the last few months, IFF has been on the look out for Net Neutrality violations. Through an online [reporting form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfW1hG9msgaILOLk1EMEY3V3UDJIZlTJPRoxgkIO7pUzuZ2aA/viewform)**,** we gathered evidence of extensive blocking carried out by not just one but various ISP’s all over the country. We created a [data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5ToesR8HCcH6bmP_s7s5jN6YlYw4t4l-ovCpmY7xyc/edit#gid=1822363676) and [provided a summary](https://internetfreedom.in/more-than-100-people-report-violations-of-net-neutrality-all-over-india-we-need-enforcement-action/) of the reports based on the information collected. A round total of 200 responses of blockings beginning January, 2019 to March 2019 was received.

In light of these rampant violations, we thought it fit to re-activate our #SaveTheInternet website and a week has passed since. The website has ""[**Take Action Petition**](https://savetheinternet.in/petition/)"" button, which allows individuals and organisations to show support to list of joint demands which is then sent to the relevant government offices. The purpose behind this decision was move beyond email support for net neutrality to active petitioning.  In this short period of a mere week, we have received tremendous support with about 970 signings.

The website also has the option to [**submit reports**](https://savetheinternet.in/report/) of any net neutrality violations to us. In addition to our earlier 200, we have received a further of 65 reports of such continued blocking. This is a brief analysis of the latest reports.

### Broad Trends

* We continue to see general blocking of porn, proxy, VPN, torrent and streaming websites; Streamable, College humour, Sound cloud, Telegram, Reddit and Alexa.com, as we did in our previous reports.  


https://i.redd.it/fp9bu0kgugo21.png

* There have been a few responses that indicate blocking of sites that measure internet speeds, gaming sites and some report pure latency being introduced for certain websites.
* A large portion of these connections are mobile based but there have been a number of wired connections reports as well.
* The ISP conducting the highest amount of blockings is Jio, both mobile and wired with some from Airtel, Hathway, You Broadband, Spectra amongst a few others. The blockings have been widespread, ranging from Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal to Maharashtra, Karnataka to name a few states.
* The most recent report that has drawn a considerable reaction from users is the blocking of indiankanoon and earlier today, taxscan. Claims are that a Government order has been provided for indiakanoon, however, there has been no evidence or reason for the blocking. Additionally, after this blocking was discovered, access has been restored to the website.

A consolidated datasheet of the form which redacts the personal details of the respondents is [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NvHjlRQSrfZZ2jTq3Qy97-Jla0AVnrAIo59smAvZ4wg/edit?usp=sharing). In our efforts to address these violations, we plan on sending a detailed response to the Department of Telecommunications and the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority of India of our findings. Please do continue to [report any violations](https://savetheinternet.in/report/), it will aid in taking necessary steps further. If you haven't shown your support for Net Neutrality yet, make your way to this [link right here and sign the petition](https://savetheinternet.in/petition/)!

Today I learned that the courts in India (or is it only the Bombay High Court) can restrict a defendant or litigant from representing themselves and can decide to legally require them to be represented by a lawyer.

This is something similar to the absurd requirement that tax returns of individuals who trade in equities and derivatives file their returns as a business and get their returns attested/filed by a CA.

Along with the obvious problem that people representing you are much less invested in your case, (whether legal or financial), such legal requirements create a situation where lawyers and CAs get an easy opportunity to loot the common man while providing the least service.",t5_2qh1q,Restricting Party-in-Person -- Is it constitutional?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b6cw9k/restricting_partyinperson_is_it_constitutional/

Over a period of time if the largest denomination you can hold is 100 rupees this makes utilizing cash extremely cumbersome and would boost electronic and digital modes of payment.

&amp;#x200B;

For all the arguments of storing assets in Real Estate, Gold, Diamonds and other assets, I realize this isn't a complete fix. Just part of a very long term plan to slowly bring it down across the board as I'm sure that at some point even these assets need to be converted to legitimate forms of tender to actually trade them. Which would again become cumbersome if the largest denomination you have is 100 rupees available.

As we had [posted before](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a92n0h/india_must_resist_the_lure_of_the_chinese_model/) the Ministry of IT was considering changes to the IT Intermediary Guidelines Rules, 2011. These changes were being considered in secret with social media companies and after [the Indian Express did a front page story](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/it-act-amendments-data-privacy-freedom-of-speech-fb-twitter-5506572/) and [we released](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/) the entire text of these rules, a [public consultation](http://meity.gov.in/comments-invited-draft-intermediary-rules) on it was announced.

These changes will harm all of us who use the internet. They will break end-to-end encryption, make indefinite data retention possible and will also require pro-active censorship by algorithms on platforms.  Please do [read our analysis here](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/).

Tomorrow the Ministry of IT is doing two things. It has first invited a select group of people for consultation on these rules. This will be attended by our executive director [Apar Gupta](https://twitter.com/apargupta84) and IFF Chairperson [Raman Chima](https://twitter.com/tame_wildcard). We will update you on what happens there.

The second thing it will be doing is that Ministry officials will conduct a [twitter Q&amp;A](https://twitter.com/GoI_MeitY/status/1081071055366701057) with the hashtag #SaferSocialMedia between 4-5 PM. Close to this Q&amp;A we will be tweeting model questions from [our twitter handle](https://twitter.com/internetfreedom) around that time. In addition to using the IT ministry's hashtag #SaferSocialMedia we will also be using #SaveOurPrivacy.

We request and call on all redditors to participate. For privacy and free speech!

### Highlights

* **Background:**  In a public interest litigation filed by the Justice for Rights Foundation in the Delhi High Court, a plea was made for separate guidelines to regulate content on online streaming platforms. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) informed the Court that the Information Technology Act is a robust enough legislation. On February 8, 2019, the High Court agreed with this submission and dismissed this PIL. 
* **Industry proposes Self-Regulation:** In January 2019 at the India Digital Summit in New Delhi, the Internet and Mobile Associations of India (IAMAI) along with some prominent online video streaming companies created a code for self-regulation. As per press reports this has been presented to MEITY and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) for endorsement. We have in the past cited concern on this measure. 
* **Giving credit where it is due:** We wrote to MEITY appreciating the position it took in affirming the sufficiency of the Information Technology Act for online video content streaming even though some provisions within it require reform. We have also called on for additional steps including seeking a correction of the order (given it cites the non-existent Section 66A) and asking a copy of it to be furnished in similar public interest litigations. 

### Background

Three interesting events have taken place bringing us to this particular intersection. 

*One:* On October 11, 2018 a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by the Justice for Rights Foundation in the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi (W.P. (C) 1164/2018) requesting the Court for guidelines on regulating certain kinds of content on the online platform. This included web based shows such as Sacred Games, Game of Thrones etc., for vulgarity, pornography, abusive language, as you can imagine, the list goes on. This is not limited to certain adult-based content but even the use of the phrase 'Holy Cow' in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ([Read the PIL here](https://barandbench.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Delhi-HC-Netflix-Amazon-online-shows-Petition.pdf)).

*Two:* On January 16, 2019, the Economic Times reported an agreement among certain companies and the IAMAI on a code for the self-regulation by online content providers. We explained the deterrent effect this would have on your online viewing experience ([Read here for more](https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-a-rethink-on-the-proposed-self-censorship-for-video-streaming-platforms/)). 

*Three*: On February 8, 2019, a division bench of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court consisting of the Hon'ble Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Hon'ble Justice V. Kameswar Rao delivered a verdict on the PIL filed by Justice for Rights Foundation dismissing the petition. This was possible largely due to the positive submissions by MIB and MEITY. 

### Appreciation with a side of caution

The Hon'ble Court affirmed that while there is no separate provision for regulating online content, the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 were not only merely applicable but an adequately armed with Section 69 to block illegal content. It also contains an entire chapter of offences which can take care of illegal content. While we are concerned with some of them, this is an incremental victory. It prevents a heavy, licensing style system from emerging in the video streaming space which would threaten our viewing choices online. 

A large part of this result is due to the submissions of both the MIB and MEITY which pointed that there is no need for further guidelines when sufficiently stringent provisions are already in existence. Agreeing with them, the Hon'ble Court instructed that if the petitioner continued to consider content provided on certain platforms prohibitory, it should take it up with the relevant statutory authority. That's legal for 'tough luck'. You can find the order of the Court [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W7g9fLcgG8vYBJuDag0NQY-OZru1npo6/view?usp=sharing).

This is a positive outcome due to the submissions made by two government ministries. We have called on them to cement this with taking the following actions: 

* **Incorrect reference to Section 66A:** The Hon'ble Court order has referred to Section 66A of the Information Technology Act which was struck down as unconstitutional. Here  government ministries should ideally approach the Court and request for a correction of this error. 
* **Utilise the Order:** After such an application has been made and a corrected order is available it may be used in similar PILs which are pending in different courts over India. This will prevent any inconsistency and help maintain our online freedoms. 
* **Avoid according sanction to the self-censorship code:**If the IAMAI Self-Regulation Code for online video streaming platforms was to receive validation, it would result in it being accepted as an industry-wide norm. Cut to, the pre-censorship of your favourite shows. This would defeat the very beauty that lies in the uninhibited nature of online viewing content. Your shows would just be one magnificent 'bleep' like *Udta Punjab* and its 94 cuts. It is for this reason we urge both MIB and MEITY to maintain its position which it took in this case. 

We will be sending a letter for these follow up actions and also seeking a meeting with their offices. You can find our letter to MIB and MEITY [at this link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16ce4AZnFeya06YZm-qSLPhNTPlzVlWwlWljEhEMEUNc).

**Highlights**

* *Background:* There have been increasing reports of website blocking by various ISP's all over India. To which we built a crowd-sourced information form encouraging users to report violations of net neutrality they were facing.  
* *Need for an enforcement mechanism*: The main threat to net neutrality is the absence of mechanism that monitors, reports and provide users with a well established redressal process to address violations.

### Background

Owing to a large public movement on Net Neutrality known as SaveTheInternet.in, the Telecom Regulations Authority of India (TRAI) made the, “Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016” which banned zero rated services after much public protest. Further consultations on the issue of technical discrimination led to the TRAI eventually introducing amendments to the Unified License conditions which upheld the intrinsic connection between net neutrality and free speech.

### Need for Action

In our previous posts, we provided information of our analysis of the reports of blockings that we received ([Read here for more](https://savetheinternet.in/blog/what-a-week-updates-from-savetheinternet/)). We also explain why website blocking is a violation of net neutrality [here](https://internetfreedom.in/what-the-block-our-net-neutrality-rules-require-a-monitoring-and-enforcement-structure/). In brief, when any blocking is carried out without direction or order of the Court/Government, it is considered to be discriminatory treatment. Additionally, even if this measure is being engaged, it is necessary that it be done in a manner that is “proportionate, transient and transparent”. Neither of these conditions have been met and have left users with no understanding of the reasons for such blockings or a mechanism for redressal. Hence, in light of the growing intensity of such violations and after seeking advice from external legal counsel, we have made a formal representation to the Department of Telecommunications requesting for certain interim steps to be carried out ([Read here for more](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wS1gUa0nl3YLM2Tlhjpej8l97cZan-yZ/view?usp=sharing)).

* That as an interim solution, investigation into the reports of violation submitted by close to 250 prople, until an enforcement body in line with the recommendations of the TRAI, is set up.
* That the DOT enforce its authority to ask for records/information of compliance by licensors especially with regard to the complaints reported to us.
* That in ensuring deterrance of such violations, necessary fines for breach be considered.

However, these are *just* the initial steps in supporting TRAI's recommendations in creating an enforcement structure for Net Neutrality.

I know people who earn 50k+ a month and have income certificates saying 'farmer - 11000 per annum'. (Which I am surprised isn't a dead give away.)

But my problem isn't that people will fake their income, screw that. My problem is, that just for the greed of votes, we have seen almost everyone voting to pass this bill in the loksabha. 

And this won't stop here. This will continue as long as people can be devided into groups. Leaving the last few groups very disadvantaged. 

Beyond that, I think we will reach about 100% reservation at this rate. 5 % here 10 % there some 3 % someplace else.  And and when we do reach there, or for every step we take towards it, we loose a little bit of our right to claim that we are a democracy. Lacking true liberty and and a level playing field, always holding a barcode and product description tag. 

I say remove all reservation.
Keep like 10% reservation for 1) First gen learners. 2) Handicapped. 3) Homeless or significantly economically weak. (Not less than 800000 per year poor, I mean 'I have no food for tomorrow' poor).

Remember our post on the secret meeting to the change the IT Rules? Well, after it was no longer a secret due to an Indian Express report, the Government went ahead and announced a public consultation. Yesterday we sent in our comments to them. Read on for the details. These proposed changes can drastically increase online censorship and hurt your privacy. 

# Highlights

* **A private meeting with a proposal to threaten our fundamental rights:** On December 24 2018, the Indian Express [**reported**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/it-act-amendments-data-privacy-freedom-of-speech-fb-twitter-5506572/) that in a private meeting with a few social media companies and industry representatives the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) proposed disturbing changes to an online law that would result in grave censorship and surveillance for Indians. We that very day published the [**full text of these proposed changes**](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/) with an influential analysis that guided public debate.
* **A ""public"" consultation:** Shortly after it MEITY announced a [**public consultation**](http://meity.gov.in/content/comments-suggestions-invited-draft-%E2%80%9C-information-technology-intermediary-guidelines) on the proposed changes. These were proposals to make changes to the liability exemptions for online platform or service provider. An intermediary is any service providers which transmits, hosts and publishes user content. So it can be your ISP, email provider, social media platform, or any web-service which allows you to post, upload and publish. These platforms because of their technical ability to connect us to others, host our data, publish it, help us realise our freedom of speech, they mediate our online experience, impact our privacy and hold great power.
* **Recall these proposed changes, start afresh:** Yesterday we sent [**our submission to MIETY**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pDQt1M81spH66kv0CHcUk8P9U_Dp9_oc/view?usp=sharing) noting the problems with the proposed changes. Our clear demand is that instant consultation with the proposed changes needs to be withdrawn. We fear this exercise is expending energy and resources on the basis of draft legal rules that lack any clear rationale that has been articulated by MEITY. The proposals themselves are substantively harmful to our fundamental rights as we explain in our submissions are unconstitutional. We instead advocate for a fresh exercise with a white paper to update our legal rules. IFF believes that our government should protect people rather than merely seeking greater powers over a few dominant online platforms.

# Analysis

This has to be the most peculiar public consultation we have participated till now. Usually public consultation exercises are done with an approach paper or first trying to understand what specific harms, benefits, or policy objectives we are trying to fulfil. Only after that is done some legal provisions are identified for change or introduction. This is not the case with the consultation on the proposed changes to the Information Technology Intermediary Guidelines Rules, 2011 (the IT Rules). On December 24, 2018 the Indian Express [**put out a report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/it-act-amendments-data-privacy-freedom-of-speech-fb-twitter-5506572/) that revealed some proposed changes were put in a private meeting to a select number of social media platforms and industry bodies.

The same morning [**we published the full text of these proposed changes**](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/). We noted problems early on with these proposed changes on grounds of privacy and free expression giving feedback rule by rule. This was widely covered by the press and became a major news story [**coming shortly after the MHA notification**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ministry-of-home-affairs-delegates-snooping-decryption-hacking-powers-abrogates-responsibility-and-undermine-privacy/). Later in the evening that very day, MIETY [**announced a public consultation**](http://meity.gov.in/content/comments-suggestions-invited-draft-%E2%80%9C-information-technology-intermediary-guidelines) on the same rules. This was without any approach paper or explaining the rationale of the suggested changes. We found this to be not only strange, but also harmful to public confidence as internet users, who will face the impact of these changes the most were de-prioritised where feedback was first sought from large, private online platforms.

We object to the substance of these proposed changes which result in undermining our fundamental rights by turning online private intermediaries into policing agencies by – breaking encryption; empowering the government to gather more personal data; using risky automated filtering; and sending monthly reminders to behave ourselves. We clearly put across our demand to recall these proposed changes and end this consultation. It is not going to lead to any meaningful change or addressing the range of harms which today require a balanced policy conversation which should then move towards legal changes.

This is drawing scarce resources and time in a critical year for our digital freedoms. We need to seriously address issues of online content censorship, privacy, discrimination and due process. The present approach both in process and substance is misguided and even harmful.

[**Our full submission to MEITY can be found here**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pDQt1M81spH66kv0CHcUk8P9U_Dp9_oc)**. Read them! We try really hard to write them in simple, non-lawyerly or policy English.**

The problems faced by the farmers large stem from their own community. At this point a large portion of them are basically economic liabilities.

It's is wasteful where 50% of our population generates only 18% gdp . We don't need to this many people and most of them are in disguised unemployment anyway

Raising MSP is basically BS and would just worsen the situation . The value of agricultural produce is usually quite low as compared to even other primary activities , this is true everywhere. Raising MSP would just put the government under more financial pressure.

The problem is largely because the land holding are too small . According to google in 2015-16 the average size was 1.08ha.

This is the biggest problem as there is simply no viable way to earn a profit from 1.08ha of normal land and crops.

It maybe possible if the crop is highly valued such as spices , medical herbs , rare or expensive flowers or other cashcrops but these things grow in a select few areas. 4-5ha can earn a decent if not high profit provided use of technology and commercial practices

Therefore the farmers just end up in an endless cycle of debt trap every few years. Small holdings cant earn a profit, the produce from these small lands just goes mostly for subsistence and there is little marketable surplus.

Despite what people say about giving technology etc. It won’t work. It would just put the government in debt instead of the people because of the same reason. These holdings are too small to effectively use technology , these farmers would gain some but still wouldn’t have enough profit to continue maintaining and using modern farming techniques and the same situation would be created.

Not only this but if a large area is controlled by a single person , he can work more efficiently , try more things as well earn enough to purchase technology himself without going into debt

There are only 3 ways I see.

1.      Consolidate the farmers land’s into corporates. I still don’t understand why farmers haven’t realized this . There are very few cooperates in this field , just seeing Mother Dairy or AMUL should have been example enough. The only way to make them do this is literally to use force as most of them are either not educated or unwilling for some stupid reason

 

2.      Encourage growing of more valuable crops wherever possible there is no reason to grow wheat or rice at place where the climate can support more valuable crops . Also by making these  people have more competitive market practices. The best way is to force them to do this by reducing protectionism

 

3.      Simply getting themselves out of agriculture . It is known that they have higher fertility rates. The only thing stopping their kids from acquiring education is their own stubbornness and idiocy. There is no reason to not send one of your 4 kids to school when literally everything related to and used in schools is free for them. They also gain money by just sending their girl child to school under Beti Padhao , Beti Bachao.

 

All in all we need to look beyond these woes and go for the long term using force if necessary. If we don’t this shit will keep repeating every few years. This is not the governments fault , these guys have every facility that maybe needed to get out that situation , it is not our responsibility if they fail to use it.

In November 2018 the TRAI released a consultation paper on the regulation of OTT services (basically online platforms and services). Telecom companies said some terrible things about the internet in TRAI’s OTT Consultation. We wouldn’t stand for it and responded in our counter-comments. We submitted comments on 8th January 2019 and our counter comments yesterday night, i.e. January 21, 2019.

**Highlights:**

* **Licensing the Internet:** The proposals pose a test of substitutability to assert that OTT and TSPs (telecom companies) provide similar services and that they should be regulated similarly. They say this is necessary for continued investment in network infrastructure.
* **Questions on policy and economic basis:** We found from data that the economic stress on telecos comes from the intense price competition they face due to the extremely low prices of their competitors. There is also no clear data on the amount of investment needed in the sector. To pose regulation for internet services in the absence of not only causation, but even a credible correlation to economic losses of telecom companies is a harmful public policy choice.
* **Protect users, not telecos and platforms:** We submit the need for legislative action and regulatory reform in the domains of privacy, consumer protection and competition law frameworks. When it comes to internet policy, end users should be the most important stakeholders. The consultation queries posed by TRAI to an extent fall outside it's jurisdictional scope. We further suggest that it must conduct a specific consultation on interception and surveillance reform in the telecom sector.

I attached my ITR from that year and replied back on email as well as submitted a physical reply to local ITO office saying that the source is my salary.

For some reason, they are now insisting on bank statements as well as credit card statements from that year. But such old statements don't seem to be available in HDFC's online systems and branch isn't of much help there. IT hasn't even mentioned the credit card number except that it was hdfc's.

So how do I tackle this? 

I have already told.thr IT department that the source was my salary (which it genuinely must be) and it isn't possible to get bank statements from 8 years back (HDFC only does statements for last 5 years). I asked what exactly are they looking for and I will be happy to explain. 

In response, they sent me a email with a threatening notice as attachment saying that unless I provide the statements in two days, further action will be taken.

Is this even legal to ask for details over a credit card payment over 8 years back? To me, this seems to be like a roving query that has been made because modi govt is seriously behind tax collections.

Due to its huge size, natural beauty, rich historical and cultural heritages India attracts millions of foreign tourists each year. However, the condition of tourism industry is pathetic in India. If we could solve some of the basic problems, India could attract a lot more international tourists.

It's a US$210 billion industry which supports 42 million jobs. For comparison our IT industry size is US$150 billion with 4 million jobs.

India receives about 15 million foreign tourists each year while Malaysia and Hong Kong receives 27 millions each. China gets 60 millions and its controlled zones Hong Kong gets 28 mil and Macau 17 mil. So, we need to better to attract a lot more foreign tourists.

There should be special tourist zones (STZ) for better investments in infrastructures, communication systems and law and order.

We need to keep the tourist places safer for the tourists, especially for the women tourists. Special security forces for the tourist spots are required. Also, they need to use modern security and surveillance systems for better efficiency.

The culture of scamming and cheating foreigners need to go. Strict actions were necessary against those cheaters.

The services like rented cars, restaurants, shops etc should be kept under strict vigilance in tourist zones.

The security forces should also check the misbehaving tourists too. We don't need assholes to destroy our national heritages and local culture.

There are many places in India with amazing tourism possibilities. Developing these regions could attract more tourists.

### Highlights

* **Background:** The draft Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules, 2018 were opened to public consultation. Initial comments from various civil society organisations and industry groups were released to counter-comments till February 14, 2019. 
* **Recall the proposed changes:** We submit our counter-comments to MEITY showing our support for the concerns of Civil society Organisations while contesting the submissions of some corporates and industry bodies that would hurt online privacy and freedom of speech. 
* **We will challenge if these changes are made**: We have clearly stated in our counter-comments that we intend to support and explore all legal remedies if these unconstitutional changes come to pass. We will continue to champion the fundamental rights of ordinary Indians who use the internet.  

### Why should you be concerned?

Do you china style restrictions on the way you can use the Internet? Neither do we. The changes proposed to the Intermediary Rules in the guise of safety, do just that. Curb your right to freedom of speech and to privacy. Previously, we explained to you that these Rules affect you whether you are an individual ([click here to read](https://internetfreedom.in/civil-society-and-research-organisations-are-unanimous-proposed-changes-to-intermediary-rules-must-be-recalled/)) or a start-up ([click here to read](https://internetfreedom.in/we-call-on-tech-start-ups-to-protect-their-users-and-businesses-press-for-a-recall-of-the-proposed-changes-to-intermediary-rules-itrules-saveourprivacy-righttomeme/)). 

These proposed changes were put to a process of consultation that ended yesterday night. In our counter-comments, we put together the tremendous support shown from Civil Society Organisations highlighting the unconstitutionality of these proposed changes ([click here to read our counter comments](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rxJoEHM1m6IXprXENQyJwxU1cMSZuu6d/view?usp=sharing)). We stand with these Organisations in the fight for your freedoms as we submit our counter comments to MEITY.

However, there are always two sides to a coin. A few Industry Groups and companies are in complete support of these Rules. For instance, Reliance Jio  states that, *“We strongly recommend that the intermediary should enable tracing out of originator of such information on its platform, which will help Government agencies identify the originator of such misleading information and hold them accountable in order to maintain cybersecurity.”* Sounds a little like a neighbouring country! 

### Defending our constitutional promises

Apar Gupta, Executive Director at the Indian Freedom Foundation in an [interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/technology/india-internet-censorship.html) with The New York Times warned, *""This is very similar to what China does to its citizens, where it polices their every move and tracks their every post on social media"".*

Throughout this process, we have tried to ensure these Rules are recalled. The Rules allow for ‘tracking’ through the weakening of end-to-end encryption, it necessitates providing the Government with information at the drop of a hat and also the removal of content on the internet based on still developing automated tools. These changes mean the information you send over applications could be traced by the Government. An intermediary could be required to provide any information about you. Anything you post on the Internet that is considered ‘unlawful’ could be taken down. These are just a few examples. 

Fundamental Rights are a constitutional promise to every Indian. But these rules are an affront to our civil liberties. 

### Video Explainers

Want to learn more? We collaborated with Bisbo (a youtube creator) to create video explainers in multiple India languages ([English](https://youtu.be/TfMEOF3gL6g), [Hindi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCh835mOt3I&amp;t=224s), [Bengali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtzvSRQppQA), [Gujarati](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRq5KqRUN-s), [Punjabi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aZvUX4RX7Q) *more to follow...*). Do watch them and send them to your college and family Whatsapp groups! The Rules are unconstitutional and violate our fundamental right to privacy and to freedom of speech and expression. But, if these Rules were to be passed in their present form you can be assured Internet Freedom Foundation will explore all means to challenge them - this includes going to court.

On 20th December 2018, the Cyber and Information Security Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued an order which authorises ten security and intelligence agencies to intercept, monitor and decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource.

We called to attention the risks this poses to our online privacy saying that it enables surveillance without any transparency or oversight. It lacks any meaningful safeguards. These arguments are at the centre of the [**case filed by IFF** ](https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-court-issues-notice-on-iffs-petition-for-survelliance-reform-saveourprivacy/)which is challenging the legality of the digital surveillance system before the Supreme Court of India.

In order to get to the bottom of this order and do something about it, IFF filed six RTIs seeking answers to the following rather basic questions:

1. How many times has the government used its powers for an interception?
2. How many agencies have been authorized to intercept, monitor or decrypt data?    
3. The names and the directions provided to the abovementioned agencies.
4. Date, time and duration of meetings conducted by the Review Committee.
5. How many times has the government received requests from different agencies seeking interception? Number of requests deniedNumber of requests approved
6. How many times has an order been issued to prevent any offence which affects the sovereignty, integrity, defence or security of the state? Number of times order issued to investigate into an offence

According to us, these are very reasonable queries. They can help us understand how surveillance works in India. How much does the state tap our smartphones? How many times does it ask for our personal data from online companies? Such disclosure can suggest broad operational trends and the implementation of safeguards. Such aggregate data would in no way impact national security.

Well to our disappointment all six RTIs were rejected. The grounds cited are sections 8(1)(a), 8(1)(g) and 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act 2005 on the grounds that ‘Disclosure of information related to lawful interception/phone tapping/monitor or decrypt is exempted’. This basically means that the government is unwilling to tell us who has access to all our private data and why they have access to it. If anything this reply confirmed was the complete secrecy and lack of oversight in digital surveillance by the Government of our personal data.

Next steps? We will be filing an appeal against this denial and pursuing these RTIs to their logical conclusion.

We would also like to indicate that RTI Activist, Mr. Venkatesh Nayak (Coordinator, Access to Information, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative) has filed similar RTIs and received a similar rejection. He has recently penned a legal analysis on it [**at the Leaflet**](https://theleaflet.in/computers-intercepted-transparency-interrupted-mhas-cpio-refuses-information-about-december-2018-authorisation-order-under-the-it-act)​.

Internet Freedom Foundation has been actively engaging with the issues of net neutrality ever since our triumphant win for open and non-discriminatory access to the Internet. We emerged victorious when net neutrality in India acquired solid footing through recommendations issued by the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) prohibiting Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services. In brief, [**we explained**](https://internetfreedom.in/trais-recommendations-are-another-big-victory-for-net-neutrality-but-follow-up-action-is-needed/) how TRAI recognised the principle of non-discrimination broadly interpreted with good reason, providing understandable exceptions along with a mechanism for transparency and accountability. However, over the years in extensively covering this issue, we have become privy to various bumps in the supposed unhindered existence of net neutrality in India.

Currently, a particularly concerning threat to net neutrality, looms the web. IFF has been engaging with users for a few months gathering evidence through its online [**reporting form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfW1hG9msgaILOLk1EMEY3V3UDJIZlTJPRoxgkIO7pUzuZ2aA/viewform)of extensive blocking carried out by not just one but various ISP’s. In a [**previous post**](https://internetfreedom.in/more-than-100-people-report-violations-of-net-neutrality-all-over-india-we-need-enforcement-action/), we disclosed a [**data sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5ToesR8HCcH6bmP_s7s5jN6YlYw4t4l-ovCpmY7xyc/edit#gid=1822363676) and provided a summary of the reports based on information collected.

### Updated Summary

1. Over the month, the number of reports provided to us has seen a considerable increase now standing at a total of 171 responses of blocking, beginning January, 2019 to March 8, 2019.
2. A large portion of our findings are mobile internet users at 62.9% while 29.3% are wired connections, graphically represented below as well.
3. Reports show that blockings conducted by Hathway have begun more recently over the past month and a half restricting access to Proxy Services, Virtual Private Networks and majorly the Telegram website.
4. Over the past few days, there have been increasing complaints against Jio for the blocking of Reddit in cities ranging from Bangalore, Chennai, to Pune and Noida.

### Seeing is believing

Understandably, one would assume a direct correlation between illegality/immorality and blocking. However, this is far from true. It has spared no corner of the web, from pornography, proxy and torrent sites, VPN's to even mainstream platforms like Archive.org, Telegram and Soundcloud. Most recently, we discovered reports as from various users as in the summary above, that **even** Reddit has been blocked specifically on Jio GigaFiber, if accessed without VPN. We provide a few instances below to exemplify our reports since naturally, seeing is believing. However, we go beyond it to active monitoring of ISPs by the DOT for compliance and eventually towards remedy.

### Is it a violation, you ask?

This blocking trend has raised significant concerns regarding its impact on net neutrality. The fundamental aspect in maintaining net neutrality is the equal treatment of all data with no restriction on the access choices of the user. The Department of Telecommunication in the amendments it carried out, aim to ensure this. Ideally, this created a prohibition on internet service providers from either speeding up, slowing down, restricting choice, bandwidth and the ability to access anything on the Internet.

It is important to understand the illegality behind these current swarm of blockings:

* Violation of Net Neutrality - Firstly, an ISP is not permitted to engage in any discriminatory treatment of content. Discriminatory here indicates any form of *discrimination, restriction or interference* in the way it treats content - it goes on to include practices such as *blocking*, degrading, slowing down or granting preferential speeds or treatment. Therefore, in light of our current block-mania, it is in clear violation of net neutrality.
* Type of Practice - Secondly, even if such practices are engaged, there is a mandate on ISP’s to be *proportionate, transient and transparent* and can be carried out only under specific conditions. We have examined a variety of reports concluding that there has been no explanation by the ISP’s for the blocking; the continuity over the last few months clearly it not temporary and neither has it been conducted transparently with no information being provided by the
* ISP Requirements - Thirdly, the conditions it fails to comply with are of particular importance to us. These practices can be conducted if an ISP is reasonably *managing traffic*, *providing emergency services* during a grave public emergency, in order preserve *integrity and security* of the network/equipment, in pursuance of an *international treaty*and most applicable to us, in *implementation of a court order or Government direction*. Evidently, the latter is especially not the reason as per an RTI request (Read here for more).

Additionally, what is of further concern is the absence of mechanism that monitors, reports and provides users with a medium to lodge complaints against ISP’s, as a safeguard. In an [**earlier submission to TRAI and the DOT**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qQcA73a63IydEZqr0XVGhG7Nak2BHvhS/view), we suggested there be an enforcement mechanism of sorts, in line with the recommendations made by TRAI. This will provide users with a well established redressal process to address net neutrality violations. We are in dire need of transparency and an enforcement mechanism as the number of merely recorded reports are becoming increasingly commonplace.

Our fight for net neutrality has stood its ground in the face of continued opposition through out these years and we will not be slack in this attempt to undermine one of India’s most significant digital victories. Over the next few weeks we will be attempting to organise a convening of important stakeholders to this conversations, examining steps for actual enforcement, remedy and complaint. We would be failing in our duty to protect Net Neutrality if we do not pick this up soon.

1549072235.0,5,0,16,"&gt; Correct me if any of this is wrong/incorrect.

So before it was kind of like the sites were having stakes in/owned by seller and they made e-commerce very reliable than any local shop seller(where I come from). Just so you know "" ONLY India(few exceptions) got the Pay on delivery service for almost all items(except the costly ones) in the world. 

The middle man in the case of farmers and ecommerce sites is almost same as he will be the one to set the price(its exactly same if you consider amazon basics products). Most local seller will try to cut deals with international sellers which I am sure very less number of sellers from outside India will be interested in. They will try to keep competitive price but it will never be as good as cloudtail or WSRetail.
**It will be just like Downshipping by Local sellers**

**Sort of a solution**: I hope we will get to see companies as sellers for some made in India and other items. China shopping sites are other reliable option if you add paid international shipping to it. They also have priority lines in India now (which is much better than slow India post). I don't have a solution for branded items or customs tax but I hope flipkart and amazon does. Maybe this fiasco will end after the elections. It will be better if people start looking for more options than just indian e-commerce sites.

Eg. I recently bought Mi Box S(global version) around 4300rs which is 7000+ rs on Indian sites like amazon.

This includes websites like Hide.me, VPNbook, Hidester etc. all of which are websites that allow the user to mask their location to access information on the internet when the same is blocked in their area.

The principle of Net Neutrality (which not has regulatory backing through license amendments) holds that telecom companies which provide internet access and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are required to treat all data equally, not interfering with the access choices of the end user, and thereby, any providers selective blocking of proxy websites is extremely concerning as it contravenes this principle and regulatory compliance.

Further, with the lack of a codified privacy law in India, blocking VPN sites completely leaves users devoid of any sort of privacy online, which means that any action on a service providers part, takes away a technical protection for one of our most essential fundamental rights. To this end, we are putting out a Google Form to the public. The intention behind this form is to collect data on which websites are being blocked and by which ISPs, after which we will look through it and see how best to remedy the situation, by complaints, approaching Government ministries, regulatory bodies etc.

1546849743.0,8,5,12,"So for past many years we have been seeing multiple advertisements for cooking oils which targeted heart and other cardiovascular health related concerns for advertising their products. They have shown women deep frying samosas for their husbands in respective brands because they care about their husband's heart. They have shown husbands failing to jog without losing their breath because they started using certain brand of oil and now husband's stamina has multiplied by 3.

&amp;#x200B;

But suddenly, maybe a week or two it seems like cooking oil brands have suddenly shifted from heart to stomach. They have started advertising the well being of stomach to advertise their product. I don't recall the brand, but yes there is one advertise running it. But what caught my attention was one shitty marathi serial on Zee Marathi had product placement for some cooking oil brand with required targeting. 

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize the serial, the leading female protagonist is owner of a company worth Rs. 300CR only while her husband is cheating on her with much younger &amp; beautiful gold digger girl. So this leading lady is cooking in her kitchen with certain brand of oil and her mom-in-law walks in and asks about change in brand. To which the lady goes that this oil keeps stomach healthy and keeps heath problems related to stomach away. \*Insert brand name while facing camera and respective catchphrase\*

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure, other brands making cooking oil must have started producing advertisements targeting stomach and in few weeks our TV programmes will be flooded with them.

1548985853.0,8,87,75,"I make the best upma on the planet. Period. Discussion ends there. You peeps out there got to envy my today's breakfast : The [Revenge of the Upma, now with delicious spinach](https://imgur.com/a/gfo7bOW). I hope you all can recognize the vegetables. Onions are not shown in the pictures, but they are **required**.If not, we should meet in person to discuss the food that you eat on your planet; may be could work out some profitable business.

There are some chopped greens and that is spinach/desi palak. This is NOT the same that you get in west. And I hope you are able to recognize those grains as well - Chick peas ( I wonder what happened to that chick), Kidney beans, Pesalu (in telugu), green peas, and kandulu (in telugu). All of the soaked and to some extent germinated. 

Now it's important to cut the ginger into long sticks. Not chopped into small little slices. When you eat upma, you will need to bite that little piece of ginger and enjoy the taste and slight tingling sensation you feel when ginger juice oozes on to your tongue. That juice when mixed with cocktail of other flavors especially tomato is heavenly to experience. Also onions too,they need to be sliced long.

How to cook? Seriously guys, vegetables know how to blend themselves with each other. Your job is to only put them in right order. So here is the order

1. Heat the oil. If it's not mustard oil, I can recommend roasting some fenugreek seeds.
2. Beans+grains. Now that these have been in preparation for a day (coz that's how you get sprouting beans you numbnuts) 
2. Chili + ginger. At least one of the chilli fellow is gonna explode. That's when you move to next step
3.  Palak. Let it cook for ~ 1 min and then add tomato. They both will blend well and signal you with a very very nice aroma. That's when you move on to the next step
4. Add some water just so that all the ingredients are just drowned and about to cry for help but not yet.
5. Bring that water to boil and now is the time to add long sliced onions. Remember onions have to be half cooked. You need them to taste 50% raw and 50% cooked when that gets tangled with long ginger and you take a bite of it.
6. Now add upma rava, keep stirring the brew while you do. It gets cooked under no time. How do you know its' cooked? It gets hard and you can't stir anymore and you stop.

Now serve yourself this wonderful upma along with some child curd.

EDIT:

To the guy who gave me silver, another recipe exclusively for him. No not for any of the other people out there. Without giving me a silver, don't use the following recipe. And [don't cheat](https://imgur.com/frDBIFC) (naughty, naughty!)

I am going out to our farmer's market (రైతు బజారు)  and buy large brinjals. Buy a cooking brush. You cut LARGE slices of brinjal, paint each of the slices with your favorite oil (mine is coconut) and gently place them in non-stick pan and cover it with lid. Now you are going to make a spicy powder that you are going to sprinkle /spread on those cooked brinjal slices

1. Ingredients:  little moong daal (మినప పప్పు), green gram (in telugu it's called pesalu పెసలు ), ground nut, red chillies, slice of dried coconut (**important**, it gives a very distinct flavor). Optional are dhaniya and jeera seeds
2. Dry fry all of the above
3. Now add some salt+ chopped garlic cloves + a ball of tamarind (dry and **important**)  and grind it to a fine powder

Once your brinjals are cooked, sprinkle the above powder and enjoy as a side dish to anything rice.",t5_2qh1q,[Food] Upma is the best food for breakfast.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/alww22/food_upma_is_the_best_food_for_breakfast/

&amp;#x200B;

First off, their 'deals' are usually a scam. Many of their restaurants list their menu prices on Swiggy while calling it a discount. It is their duty as an aggregator to correct this behaviour - which they do nothing about.

&amp;#x200B;

Further, theres a higher than 50% chance I will get the wrong order. 

&amp;#x200B;

My worst experience was when there were numerous items missing from my order and they did not refund or replace but issued a coupon for 1/5th the value of the food. That is called THEFT.

&amp;#x200B;

They claim that 'missing items/wrong items is the restaurants fault'. Hey, idiots, I am paying YOU not the restaurant. It is YOUR FAULT and YOU are responsible.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst is their 'customer support team' aka 'bunch of baboons at a keyboard'.

&amp;#x200B;

All they do is copy paste apologies, saying 'we assure you this will not happen again', and then it ALWAYS happens again.

&amp;#x200B;

Asked how I can speak to a manager, and the last SIX executives I spoke to kept ignoring the question, replying with irrelevant nonsense, then closing the chat.

&amp;#x200B;

This cesspool of a disgusting, charlatan company should be boycotted completely.

It's not, the slogan, ""Breakfast is the most important meal of the day,"" was invented in the mid 19th century by Seventh Day Adventists James Caleb Jackson and John Harvey Kellogg to sell their newly invented breakfast cereal food stuffs. Yes, that Kellogg. Then the bacon market jumped on that bandwagon, got 5,000 doctors to sign off on the health benefits of eating protein in the morning, and got news papers to publish the signatories as though it were scientific research.

It was all founded on bullshit. It was a weird time, where people were moving into factories and people were getting all up about indigestion. Kellogg was also weird about the morality of breakfast and thought bland food would curb masturbation. If you look into this period, it gets weirder than that. I blame all the lead and mercury in the water. That shit makes you dumb and fucking crazy.

Although these rankings don't hold any strength and are based on personal/experience.
Also each country may think its food is beast but we do deserve more popularity.

2. Healthy unlike a pizza with maida.

3. We have the vast diverse cultures and unique flavours.

4. Mouth watering types of sweets and time pass namkeen.

 I do understand each person thinks its own countries food is better/tasty. I'm asking to fight Pancake Vs Dosa, also I'm not fighting against a Pizza. 

What do you guys feel, Do you feel we deserve better?


Edit: Smh, I am aware that each country thinks it is great, they have more varieties and not a about competition.  
Its just the popularity and awareness about the wide range of healthy and tasty dishes we have like.

*I am not asking to rank foods

**again I'm not saying that our desi foods are healthy.

***I'm also aware even other countries having healthy ingredients.",t5_2qh1q,What's your take on Indian cuisine?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b6lig7/whats_your_take_on_indian_cuisine/

1550377645.0,8,28,89,"I recently heard this news that one of my friends has got placed in Cognizant. *Woah, great news*, I congratulated him and conversation continued. He told,

&gt;*I'm going to Cognizant Internship on Weekdays, and on Weekends he's on Delivery duty with Zomato.*

Out of Curiosity, I told him if I could join him on a day in delivery here in Chennai and go on Deliveries with him. Here's a short compiled list of things that I learnt from, and I would like to pen them down for you.

## So, here you go,

* When asked, why did he chose to be a Delivery guy, his answer was pretty much straight saying, "" I was bored in the room and couldn't stay"", so chose this to keep himself busy.
* The next reason that he stated was the amount he was earning, he goes to intern at Cognizant from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, sometimes longer **every day** for a month. But he earns Rs. 12,000 INR but same time spend on this delivery services get him Rs. 40,000 INR per month, depending upon the orders he delivers. Later, when he got busy with Cognizant, he chose to do it on Weekends.
* He was very conscious that Job at Cognizant is secure and scalable down the line in next 3 - 5 years, while working a delivery guy is not.
* He intentionally asked his dad that, to drop him an amount fixed of Rs. 6000 INR in his account. Anything beyond the expenses of Rs. 6000, he would take from his own earned savings.
* He spent the initial amount from his friend, to get a Pre-owned Bike. Which he later turned into his own in 2 weeks of full-day service on Zomato.
* He's very much clear and passionate about doing some business and is definitely on this way. While Job acts something secure for his parents &amp; the society.
* He also has one of his colleague in Zomato who also works Cognizant and earns Rs. 1,50,000 INR per month. But, he joined Zomato along.

## While that was very pretty much about him, and his experience with the delivery goes this way,

* On December 31, 2018, he wasn't actually ready or in a mood to enjoy the new year. Zomato app for Delivery guys was pretty much easy, they just have to **toggle between online/offline.**
* So, he just kept his phone online, and got an Order that late night, and exactly at 12:01 AM he went on to the doorstep to deliver the order.

&gt;*""The customer, took the order, shared me the new year cake &amp; hugged me. Also, showed me so much gratitude.""*

* This guy was special, since he was pretty much familiar with technology than the other uneducated delivery guys, he used to understand the exact address &amp; map locations. The best part was, **he only does doorstep delivery**, no matter it's on 4-5 floor Apartment.
* If the phones go below 20% of charge, the app doesn't work. Once set 'Online', the app takes the complete control over the phone. You cannot turn the phone off or put it in silent mode, soon.
* Sometimes they have classes. They are taught to wear shoes and behave politely.
* Zomato only allows you to become a delivery for one particular Region who you chose to deliver to. You cannot go beyond that.
* All their batch take Group Photos when they wait near a restaurant and have their own WhatsApp group. He's a Batch POC to remaining 22 members of his batch. (Similar to Class Representative in Colleges :P)
* There are few people, who think they'll get more orders to deliver if he waits for nearest to the computer of the manager in the restaurant he's waiting in. That sounds funny, but it is true. More orders are like more marks.

**How do you get an order that has to be delivered on mobile?**

""I need to toggle to Active mode, once that's done as soon as some order is ready for me to get it delivered, the restaurant owner and I will get a screen asking to accept the order. I need to swipe it. Then I have to go to the Restaurant owner to get an OTP and enter in my app. (Which basically says the customer, the Delivery boy has reached the restaurant) Once swiped, Order details will appear to get the food to deliver."" he said.

**Do you know who is the CEO of Zomato is?**

**""I don't know who CEO is, (laughs), but if you ask the same to my colleagues here on service waiting along with others on they don't even know what 'CEO' is!""** *That said, I've asked him an irrelevant question, maybe.*

**Share me one interesting incident that happened with you?**

""Once there was one of us, who took a U-Turn in the wrong direction. It was Delivery boy's mistake. But when police caught him, all the delivery boys in that area joins to please the officer to leave him. The interesting part is, it just takes on WhatsApp message in the group, and all the guys in the batch will turn their **Active status off** and suddenly, no delivery boy will be available to serve customers.""

## Safety

Well that being said, for any delivery guys the biggest nightmare while they go on a delivery is Safety. Of course, I've experienced that part to. We were going calm straight, and suddenly met with an accident.

We were probably lucky enough that we didn't go with any serious injuries, but just a few minor ones.

So here's a picture of the bike that's damaged. - **Removed**

&amp;#x200B;

Looks like something serious happened.

## Finally,

After learning so much from him, here's what I just said what I want to,

*""I really love the values you hold, You are very much conscious and practical about the life and now, you already took action to build it the right way, while there are millions fail pick. I see you also have personal targets to save money and measure your success by the amount of money you make. While that's quite a good practical metric, there's also my last piece of advice for you. Money is only a need &amp; business is what you want to do. Figure out Why you want to do anything you plan for.""*",t5_2qh1q,A day out with Zomato friend on Delivery,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/arh2rt/a_day_out_with_zomato_friend_on_delivery/

Sometimes he made actions as if he were speaking to someone in a conversation. He looked as if he was mentally ill. Everyone around him passed by him, and one; not even **one** spoke to him or even asked him for help.

When someone visits home(no matter who he is, plumber or not), we don't let him leave without at least biscuits and tea, whether he needs(or wants) it or not.

1547227504.0,2,61,152,"I just wanted to share an experience I had at the end of last year with you guys.

This was a couple days after Christmas and me and my buddy went out drinking. A friend, who's a teetotaler, joined us later that night and the bar called last shots at 11:30. This would be my last drink with these friends in a while since my friend was leaving the country. So we decided to post-game by grabbing some booze at the local MRP and going to my place.

While my parents don't mind the occasional drink, they don't know that I smoke and at 1 AM, with drinks in hand, we found a comfy bench in front of my very own home to enjoy the night with a much needed cigarette.

2 cigarettes were ""countered"" and a Hoysala cop car stopped in front of us. Though we tried to explain our side of the story, we were shoved into the van and taken to the police station. 

After some ""negotiating"" the ""fine"", they finally agreed to let us go. Just as my friend was taking out his wallet, his vehicle key fell out. The cop grabbed the key from his hand, as he bent to pick it up. And asked us to go take a seat.

A while later, a clumsy, drunk man traffic inspector came to the station. I'd more readily describe him as a vagabond, than an inspector. He asked us to take a breathalyzer test. He slapped me twice and my friend once as we protested to take the test. Yes, we weren't the ideal citizens! But the only offense we'd committed was drinking (quietly, if I might add), on the footpath.

Finally, we budged and took the test. They conveniently missed testing our teetotaler friend, who was our designated driver for the night. After slapping a total of 7 traffic related cases, including one for not wearing the seat-belt and causing obstruction to the traffic, they let us go telling us to collect the key after paying the fine at the court.

That wasn't the end of the ordeal. We were absolutely clueless when we went to court the next day and this advocate approached us saying he'll handle the process for a price - ₹2,000. Now that I look back at it, the price was uncalled for since he spent less than 5 minutes filling out a single form. It's hard to not believe that the court process is made to be intentionally hard for an average man to navigate around. (The advocate shares his cut with the others). 

While trading tales with a stranger at the court, he was telling us about how the cops have targets to meet. He was narrating a conspiracy of how the cops spend the first half of their quarter mostly taking bribes and not meeting the targets and at the end of every quarter, they try frame people to make up for it. This seems to explain the behaviour of the cops we had the unfortunate luck of meeting the previous night.

After paying an additional ₹2,000 to the drunk traffic cop from the previous night, for no apparent reason, he asked us to meet us outside the police station to collect the key. He opened the trunk of his scooter to reveal a bunch of keys along with a neatly stashed cover with what looked like a liquor bottle.

I don't know what I could have done differently that night. Not sign the receipt ""confessing"" that I was driving drunk and get slapped a few more times? Contest my case and plead not guilty in court? I genuinely feel helpless seeing the degree of corruption and greed in India.",t5_2qh1q,How I lost my faith in the Indian police system,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aexmaj/how_i_lost_my_faith_in_the_indian_police_system/

I learnt more about this app from him and this online community called Reddit India in it. I find the app useful myself. So here I am deciding to give it a shot myself as well as keep an eye on my son. I guess this is the best way I can monitor him as well as gain information from this forum. 

I hope I am accepted here as I have heard that this is a group of rather young people. I may be a bit old for your tech savvy language but I am open to learning more. Hoping for a better time here.

We've been together for almost a year but his student Visa is ending so he must return to his home town of Gwalior in India. As I've recently completed my education, he's asked me if I'd like to join him back to India and live with him for a few months while he saves up money. At first I really liked the idea, I really to visit India for the first time as well as meet his family. However, I recently came across a few articles that described Gwalior as India's most dangerous city for women.

&amp;#x200B;

Also this video of a Half Swedish, half Indian made India sound terribly dangerous. She said people can get chopped up there:  [https://youtu.be/OafSeEqFaw0?t=140](https://youtu.be/OafSeEqFaw0?t=140) 

&amp;#x200B;

I also heard that it is even more dangerous for Western women than it is for locals. My boyfriend assures me that things will be fine for me there, but he grew up in a family with only brothers so he might not know how it is like for women. Furthermore, I enjoy wondering around on my own and from what I read, that won't be possible for me in Gwalior as I'm a woman.

Please help - a friend of mine is seriously depressed and his  psychologist  has asked him to go somewhere alone in india for a retreat of 7-10 days.

Are you familiar with any retreat centers he can go to which are not much costly and he cannot afford it - he does 
not have a job now. But i will help him financially even if the place is costly. So all options are open.

He likes mountains , nature but i cannot think of any to recommend to him. He is currently in his native place in Odisha.

Please give some pointers on places if you have gone somewhere alone for a complete retreat.

Edit: Financially i will also help him. We are looking out for all options for him, so
please please i request all of you who have done this or know about a place , please i request  you to tell me.",t5_2qh1q,[R] Please help - Retreat center in India.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b2236i/r_please_help_retreat_center_in_india/

However, in the last 2 months I noticed the temperature rising to mid 80s, throttling the graphics card. Before this, the card rarely if ever rose above 70*C under the heaviest of loads. (Airflow in my case is a non issue as I have 5 fans in a recommended intake and exhaust configuration. This was verified after I put my old GTX 770 in, temperatures have never exceeded 73*C on this one)

Furthermore, the 1080 Ti would regularly crash while browsing with a black screen and eventually recover with an error: ""Display driver has stopped responding and was recovered."" Again, this issue does not occur with the 770 I have since put in its place. Also the files I recorded with Shadowplay would either be corrupted or be stuttering like mad.

So I figured the 1080 Ti is the problem, not any other component in my PC and submitted the card to the Gigabyte service center for RMA. That was on February 19. Today the service center called me to say the card was fine. Their engineer tested the card and he says it's stable at 95*C to 100*C. That doesn't sound good to me but that's not all that was wrong with the card. The guy on the phone said the engineer could not replicate the black screen issue. It doesn't sound like the engineer tested properly at all, nor did he say anything about the Shadowplay issue.

Now Gigabyte said nothing was fixed with my card and I won't be getting a replacement. If you're going to buy a graphics card, don't let it be Gigabyte.",t5_2qh1q,Bad experience with Gigabyte Graphics card.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/avbyrl/bad_experience_with_gigabyte_graphics_card/

1550478315.0,2,34,122,"Today, that is on 18th february, 2019 I got a call at 10:30 AM from alleged paytm employees from their call centers saying I had won a lucky draw and I can choose any out of five, very expensive products, which were a refrigerator, AC, LED TV, a dell laptop and a iphone 7 . The very first thing that came in my mind was that, this has to be a scam. But the alleged paytm employee whose name she says as 'Pooja' managed to not only tell me my registered mobile number which I had used to create an account on paytm, but also my entire residential address !

&amp;#x200B;

But, I was still suspicious, so I humored her for a bit and then told her I was unsure which product I wanted and was it possible to call them afterwards, she obliged by saying yes, but told me to call in an hour. In that time, I decided to google recent paytm call center scams, and this one resembled my experience word for word :- [https://consumercomplaintscourt.com/fraud-call-in-the-name-of-paytm-mall/](https://consumercomplaintscourt.com/fraud-call-in-the-name-of-paytm-mall/)

&amp;#x200B;

The girl was allegedly raped a few months ago, by a college student.

The principal and several other authorities have been suspended. They had failed to report the case of pregnancy earlier and also tried to cover-up.

&gt; *On being informed, the Headmistress reached the hostel and drove the girl with the newborn out through the back door in an apparent bid to suppress the incident*.

&gt; The Odisha government has suspended the school's headmistress and three assistant superintendents in connection with the incident. Six other employees of the school are also being questioned. 

&gt; On Sunday, police arrested a third-year college student — a resident of Takalmaha village for allegedly raping the minor. Superintendent of Police, Khandamal, Pratik Singh said Shraban Pradhan allegedly raped the girl when she had gone to her village in Daringbadi for vacation a few months back.

&gt; As per allegations, Nayak raped the girl and continued to exploit her with false promises of marriage. But, after the girl got pregnant, he refused accept her.

&gt;  Soon after news about the incident spread Sunday, a large number of locals had staged a demonstration and put up a blockade on the National Highway 59 demanding immediate arrest of the culprit and stern action against school officials.

&gt; The alleged sexual abuse has come to light over a year after the headmaster of a girls school in tribal-dominated Koraput district was in October 2017 arrested for allegedly raping and impregnating a class 9 student.

&gt; A cook at a residential school in Malkangiri district was arrested three months earlier in July 2017 over allegations of impregnating an 11-year-old girl after sexually abusing her repeatedly.

&gt; ######Pregnant student undergoes abortion in Odisha

&gt; Barely five days after minor student of a tribal residential school delivered a baby girl in Kandhamal district, another schoolgirl was found to be pregnant in Kalahandi and had to undergo abortion. 

&gt; A resident of Bihar, the Class IX student and hostel boarder of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in Narla was six months pregnant. The matter came to light when the girl had to be hospitalised after complaining severe bleeding and abdominal pain on Monday.

&gt; *Such a serious issue, however, was reportedly attempted to be covered up by school authorities*.

&gt; Principal of the tribal residential school at Thuamal Rampur was arrested a month back. He had sexually assaulted a Class IX student and boarder of the girls hostel last year. The girl was taking part in the decoration of the puja mandap in the school when the headmaster committed the heinous act.

&gt; ######Another minor delivers child in Odisha

&gt; A 14-year-old delivered the child at Danagadi Community Health Centre (CHC) on Thursday night

&gt; The girl had become pregnant but hid it from family members.

&gt; After six months of pregnancy, the girl revealed everything to an Asha worker in her area, who informed her family members. Later, the victim also narrated her ordeal to her parents.

&gt; After the efforts of her family members to contact Pintu went in vain, her father lodged a complaint at Kalinga Nagar police station on December 26 last year. He alleged that his minor daughter was raped and impregnated by Pintu Jena with a false promise of marriage.

&gt; *However, the Kalinga Nagar police did not act immediately*. It was only on Thursday that they took her to POCSO court in Jajpur town  to record her statements.

And: 

&gt; ######2 students in Odisha found pregnant. The girl became serious when an attempt was made to abort the foetus of the pregnant girl at the local Narla hospital.

&gt; A day after a minor school girl at Baliguda in Odisha’s Kandhamal district delivered a premature girl child, two separate instances of school students becoming pregnant have come to the fore, raising doubts over the supervisory work of the state education department. Reports from Kamakshyanagar in Dhenkanal district on Friday said that a Class VI student of a government residential school has been seven-months pregnant.

&gt; It is suspected the girl was made pregnant by the brother of her sister-in-law (brother’s wife). The police has started investigation into the case.

&gt; As the girl’s condition deteriorated, she was shifted to VSS Medical College and Hospital at Burla in Sambalpur district.

It's hard to explain clearly why I am depressed. It's a combination of deep-rooted inferiority complex and self-esteem issues coupled with awful events which have recently happened. The fabric of life has been torn. There is no structure or order in it but just chaos all around. Life is miserable when everyone around you is doing so well in their life and career and you are going nowhere. You don't have much parental or siblings support, no friends close enough to bare your hearts to and frequently cry yourself to sleep wondering if anyone will really care if you are gone. You try and post online in vain hoping someone will hear but deep down you know that people have enough shit in their life already and can't truly help you. It is you who will have to eventually pull yourself out of this hole but you just can't find the strength to do it.

So you just lie in your bed hoping that if you don't find enough strength to get out of the hole, you someday find some to dig deeper and just end it all.

The cartridges are expensive and the blades go blunt after the first few shaves. I hated shaving which did impact the way i looked.

I recently started wet shaving and the difference is huge!. Its much skin friendly( No razor bumps). It hurts less after shaving and most importantly it makes me want to shave everyday.

I used to spend 1.2k for an 8 cartridge pack, which lasted for like 3 months (AT BEST). After moving to wet shaving, the blade cost is so low. I get 100 blade pack of Astra platinum blades for 1k, which i can use for a year if i used one blade for three shaving sessions (Definitely i can use one blade for longer). Even better value is supermax blade which costs 350 rs for 100 pack. Its hell lot of value and you can save and spend em on something else.

It has a bit of learning curve. Just do not give up after doing it once. Check out youtube videos on how to wet shave. People do it effortlessly.

I would suggest watching this :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps88RU_BXlA

The initial investment will be a bit huge or dead cheap depending on what razor you buy. Parker is made in India company that makes Quality razors and its highly regarded worldwide and available on amazon if not locally. Romer razors are inexpensive. The difference is that blade angles dont need to be adjusted in expensive ones because the razor is precise to its micrometer length for any blade. A razor is a long term investment.

**Something in it for environment :**

It's hard to recycle a combination of metal + plastic. Gillette razors and cartridges are not enviroment friendly. Gillette doesn't sell DE razors anymore.

Here's the make in india products i bought and I would suggest this for starters.

Parker 24c open comb razor

I drafted few of the points and frustrations I had with the media and the way current government dealt with things. These are strictly my opinions and Since Reddit is Anonymous forum, I decided to put across my thoughts here in no particular order. Writing this seem to help some of the frustrations I had with current uncomfortable situation we landed in.

**Current Indian Media houses**

* Hyper nationalistic, sensational and Run behind TRP
* I am still hunting for 1 channel that does not put opinions, speculations, ""Trusted"" sources, debates, useless graphics before factual reporting.
* Still can’t understand why media want to show things which are not confirmed and corroborated by facts and official statements.
* Many channels pick old videos from youtube, pictures from internet that matches their imagination and Narrative and try to show that as reporting pieces :(
* Media houses seem to have formed a mini cartel in a race to TRP and ad revenue, Everyone including educated public and media houses know how messed up the reporting and journalism standards in multiple instances, they should among themselves come to a consensus of what is good reporting and stick to it in long term.
* Long term effects of not having a reputed and non-biased media house might hurt india's democracy image. Remember media is 4th pillar of democracy, We should keep our pillars strong and healthy. I have not followed DD news, excuse my ignorance , I follow private media houses like most Indians do

**What I think is right Media:**

* Have a strict guidelines for media reporting issues concerning National Security. Every reporting piece that comes in media should be clearly mentioning the sources of reporting, Other cases it has to mark the screen space clearly visible mentioning if the piece is Speculation, Opinion etc.
* Should follow a good degree of restraint in situation like this, 27/11, Surgical Strikes etc and be an example, not a laughing stock among its own people and others.
* I understand faster reporting and quality of content reported need to be traded off in this age of smart phones and Social Media, I am still looking for that national news channel that has this tradeoff in right proportions.
* I am still looking for that media house that has Dhoni's calmness and composure even in trying times. This might Garner respect in international community, from citizens and even from enemies

**Current Government**

* Government should be just a decision maker for military proposals. None of these should be used for political rallies or propaganda’s. EC should have guidelines for election propaganda like they have for Hate speeches. Country comes first, Not a particular ruling party win / loss in elections based on hot headed decisions.
* Government should start enforcing guide lines to media houses reporting sensitive information.
* If there are strikes behind enemy lines, why are we giving the information out such in first place, why are we trying to satisfy our anger and ego? Keep faith in out

**What I think is could be done by Government**

* Not every military action by every country will be successful every time, there will be surprises, losses and wins, let military decide what is what and government be the rubber stamp approving their proposals. Disclose only what is needed and others should be kept confidential
* Strikes behind enemy lines should be highly classified with a time limit (5y, 10y, 20y, 50y etc) after which details can be made public.
* Public and media pressure should not decide the course of Military, Navy and Airforce actions. I understand emotions can be high but again country comes first and let these professionals deal with it.
* Have a goal and Narrative, in this case the goal could be ""**JEM killed our Soldiers, we want JEM to be recognized as terrorist outfit and its leaders handed over to India and any other organizations started by its members to be going through Pak's approval with records in future**"". The Narrative and actions should stick to this until goal is reached and we move on to the next goal.
* Right now I have an opinion that we seem to have slightly lost our narrative, we are trying to show Pak used an F-16 when they responded back for our strikes? If I look at the narrative and proof's provided as a neutral source, I am more convinced of their narrative and peace proposal than India's. Get your narrative right and keep it aligned with the Goals.

**Personally**

I am against war, Religion based biases in countries and systems. I really want to see peaceful relationship between India and Pakistan like France, Germany and Europe has right now. I hope both the countries grow strong economically and have lot more visa free travel and cultural exchange. Some where deep down, I also imagine Unification of both countries and grow ourselves to be a super power. I know I am dreaming, but why not?

We WILL NOT use Adhaar, no matter how much convenience we have to sacrifice, until Modi makes us by making it illegal to use any other ID, plain and simple.

So I found out that my wife is cheating. I am 39 and she is 33 and we have two kids, a girl and a boy. I am very upset. The marriage is broken irreparably. I want out.

I have an appointment with lawyer next monday to discuss this over. The wait of next two days sees unbearably long. 

Knowing my wife, I know it's going to be a big drama which I want to avoid at all costs. I just want to put evidence of her activities before her and part our ways silently. What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? I will also hire a PI the first thing the next week.

I'd like to have full custody of our children. Does anyone know under what conditions will I be able to get that?

EDIT:

Thanks for all your responses. Few were helpful, few disturbing and few others distasteful. Anyway, I am just normal at home as if nothing happened. I have a strictly predictably routine and I intend to keep it that way. I am off to drop my daughter at her friend's place who is celebrating her birthday today.

I am very methodical and I'll deal with this issue just like that. I am going to write down everything I plan to do, rehearse it multiple times with my lawyer (he responded), plug holes and build a solid case.

There are many suggesting that I don't monitor her activities as it's illegal. I can appreciate that. But I am anyway going to do it. What's important to me primarily is the evidence, the truth and the full picture. What I do with it is totally a different matter altogether. I may not tell her, I may just poke and see the response, I may not not use the evidence for legal proceedings (and that's up to lawyer anyway) or I may just burn it all.

Initially people considered this to be just an accident, but after the police conducted interviews and later found a note in his bag, it was confirmed to be a suicide.

Now clearly, this is a rather somber incident, and you'd expect the college authorities and the student's classmates to react accordingly, right?

Wrong. Over the past few days all I've heard from my friends, and surprisingly, even my teachers are conspiracy theories about what drove him to commit suicide, and some good old victim blaming about how stupid he was to end his life. Heck, even our HOD took some time off his lecture to jokingly ask us if any of wanted to follow his footsteps and take our own lives. People were going on about how it was about his girlfriend leaving him, his falling grades, his failures to get a job etc. Honestly, this has fuelled more gossip in my college than any TV series/movie ever would. Pretty much everyone had a theory, and pretty much everyone was vilifying the student.

No one thought about the issues he might have been facing. No teacher thought about genuinely raising an awareness about mental health issues. We didn't even observe a minute of silence before class or something. I know it's a bit too much to expect but will the majority of India ever change it's attitude towards mental health and/or suicide?

1552999412.0,2,165,4,"I've always felt that I was right wing ever since I became an atheist 5 years ago. I agreed with most of the people here that there needs to be a serious talk about the muslim community, and instead of appeasement politics there needs to be real reform coming from within the community itself to fix our issues ranging from extremism to illiteracy.

However, when I came to the right wing a lot of what I've seen is that there seems to be very little nuance here as to what the solution of our problems is as a nation. Just recently when Nas. shah made some comments, people started spouting out the most vicious vitriol towards him. People regularly call Javed Akhtar a pakistani here, and any comments from such agnostic muslims is always met with this word in bold: TAQIYYA.

​

Growing up in a fairly moderate muslim family, I can honestly say I've never heard of this phrase in my life. When I asked my parents, they didn't know about it either. I had to google to find out what it actually meant.

​

So here's some clarification which I feel the saner voices of this group might be able to appreciate. Most Indian muslims I've known in my life have been the most liberal and non practicing out of all other muslim nationalities. Most Indian muslims get offended if you call them pakistanis because it's actually offensive considering we actually like the fact that we're Indians and not pakis. Most Indian muslims practice their own version of Islam, and most of them have cognitive dissonance in that area. But most people in the right wing keep criticizing muslims with such intense and deep rooted anger that I feel like even though I agree with most policies of the right wing, I could never belong here.

​

There are people who bash muslim superstitions with such intensity, but completely shut down when you question their superstitious beliefs. I don't know if it's willful ignorance or they've just been misinformed about how muslims think.

​

Ofcourse I can't speak accurately as to how Indian muslims feel because I haven't been one for a while, and this is just anecdotal. But as someone who's probably been more victimized by his religion at birth than most people in the right wing, I can clarify any genuine questions you might have and open some dialogue. I'll try not to be biased in any way, although rooting out bias 100% is impossible for any human being.

This is a huge problem with the state of public discourse in India. Maybe even the world but that is not relevant to us.The lack of nuance while discussing any community. Coming from a religious muslim household I've never heard the term manu smriti or anything written in it discussed ever in my life but manu smriti is thrown at me because I'm an indian living in india. Every christian is seen as a bible thumping evangelist who hates hinduism. Every muslim is seen as a radical islamist. Goes beyond religions too. Anyone who doesn't absolutely detest and spew vitriol on modi is a sanghi, bhakt, gaumutra drinker bigot. Anyone who criticizes modi is a leftist and a naxal. Every tamilian is a separatist who wants to secede. Every maharashtrian is a bigot who beats up biharis.

Now there are definitely a small vocal percentage of these communities who fit these categories but victimizing the rest of the community with this brush and attacking them constantly forces them to get defensive and take an extremist position even if they aren't otherwise.

I suspect a lot of these opinions come from an internet generation whose only exposure to the community they're spewing hatred towards is the internet where they hang out in their bubble and constantly read only of the extremist opinions of that community. To add to that India is also completely unprepared to deal with propaganda and informational warfare in the internet age. We saw that in recent examples just on reddit where a rpak moderator was caught pretending to be a sikh khalistani and in the pulwama issue where even though every fact was in india's favour all the discussions in major subs were tilted pro pakistan. Its very easy to manipulate all online discourse in India with minimal effort even by a single individual. Doesn't even require some grand conspiracy by a foreign government.

1551722836.0,2,36,41,"Let me preface this by saying that this is not a ""hating Pakistani people"" post as not all of them can be held responsible for their indoctrination, just as we have seen spate of controversies regarding history being changed in our textbooks after Modi's election(and to be fair past congress governments are not blameless), their rulers too have fomented hate by indoctrinating children. 

**And that's not to say people in Pakistan don't care about this, they do recognize the problem and since 2011 have made efforts to rectify this.**

Now this came to my notice when I saw Wing Commander Grewal who was a POW of Pakistanis during the 71 war saying on a Barkha Dutt show that ""Pakistani civilians hate Hindus"" and I was ready to dismiss that as an over the top rhetoric, but after searching a bit I came to the conclusion that he was right, following is what I found after googling ""What do Pakistani textbooks teach about Indians""

[‘Pakistan schools teach Hindu hatred’](https://www.dawn.com/news/672000)

&gt; Text books in Pakistani schools foster prejudice and intolerance of Hindus and other religious minorities, while most teachers view non-Muslims as ''enemies of Islam,'' according to a study by a US government commission released on Wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; The findings indicate how deeply ingrained hard-line Islam is in Pakistan and help explain why militancy is often supported, tolerated or excused in the country.
&gt; 
&gt; ''Teaching discrimination increases the likelihood that violent religious extremism in Pakistan will continue to grow, weakening religious freedom, national and regional stability, and global security,'' said Leonard Leo, the chairman of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom.


[What is the most blatant lie taught through Pakistan textbooks?](https://www.dawn.com/news/1125484)

&gt; The most blatant lie in Pakistan Studies textbooks is the idea that Pakistan was formed solely because of a fundamental conflict between Hindus and Muslims. This idea bases itself on the notion of a civilisational divide between monolithic Hindu and Muslim identities, which simply did not exist.
&gt; 
&gt; The stress on religion ignored other factors that could cut across both identities. For instance, a Muslim from most of South India had far more in common, because of his regionally specific culture and language, with Hindus in this area than the Muslims in the north of the Subcontinent.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Similarly, the division of the historical narrative into a ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’ period, aside from the ironic fact that this was actually instituted by the British, glosses over the reality that Islamic empires also fought each other for power. After all, Babar had to defeat Ibrahim Lodhi, and thus, the Delhi Sultanate, for the Mughal period to begin.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, power and empire building often trumped this religious identity, that textbooks claim, can be traced linearly right to the formation of Pakistan.

[Why do Indian and Pakistani textbooks tell wildly different histories?](https://scroll.in/magazine/813864/why-do-indian-and-pakistani-textbooks-tell-wildly-different-histories)

&gt; In 2005, Qasim Aslam and Ayyaz Ahmad, two young Pakistanis, saw this up close. They were invited to be part of a Seeds of Peace conflict resolution camp in Maine, USA – a platform that brought together children from India and Pakistan to hold dialogues. In one of the workshops, the children compared the historical timelines of their two countries.
&gt; 
&gt; During the discussion, conflicting viewpoints emerged and ricocheted off each other – the children from both sides of the border nurtured a different narrative of a shared history. “What we realised while talking to our Indian friends was that it was very difficult to have a peaceful conversation because both sides didn’t know what the other side had been taught,” recounted Ahmad. There were evident discrepancies in the two versions of history.
&gt; 
&gt; When Aslam and Ahmad returned home to Pakistan, that incongruity disconcerted them. In their mind, it lingered and remained. Six years later, in a casual conversation, the two decided to start working on a book that would juxtapose the Indian version of history with the Pakistani one, highlighting where the respective historical trajectories deviated and merged. That was the birth of The History Project.

Basically someone really smart and who actually understands what he's talking about and can talk about it without shouting. Anyone, who's been obsessing about the Balakot air strikes (like me) should definitely watch this interview:

[Balakot And After: Assessing Gains And Risks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nX_fU6KGcA)

For TL;WD, he makes the following key points:

1. That the government needed to take this action and it has had major gains. But he says by making it a political theme, the strategic gains have been diminished. The airstrikes went from being an action that **India** undertook to impose costs on Pakistan, to becoming something *Modi* did to win elections. Menon says, the number of terrorists who died, the size of holes on the roofs, etc are totally irrelevant or only useful for political theater, the only measure of success is whether India got the outcome it wanted.

2. He has a negative view of foreign policy under Modi, they have done well with China but lost the initiative with Pakistan.

3. There should be a full spectrum of options, apart from military strikes available to deal with Pakistan including diplomacy, overt strikes, covert action, economic coercion, etc. He also implies in his book that India refrained from overt military action after Mumbai 2008, but used a broad variety of covert means inside Pakistan.

4. India should understand that Pakistan has several constituencies like common people, businessmen, civilian politicians, jihadis/Army, etc and Indian strategy should deal with each differently. Especially because many of these constituencies have aims very different from the Jihadis/Army that actively seek to harm India. By shutting down visas, trade, etc India loses ways to pressure Pak in the future.

5. Most interestingly, he says Pakistan is a strategic distraction and we shouldn't focus too much on them. Our challenges are to become a powerful country and take people out of poverty, create a developed India. He says that even when Pakistan was very successful in exporting terror to India in the 80s and 90s, India still managed to do quite well.

Basically, to treat Pakistan like a mosquito, punish it when needed but not waste too much effort on it. He also questions the entire thing about getting Masood Azhar on the UN list because it's a waste of time and energy and achieves nothing.


What I really love about this guy is that he doesn't think of short term politics and only what India (which is not Modi) should do and the direction it should take.

Interestingly, based on a reference in his book, I looked up [an interview with Manmohan Singh in 2004](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/24/opinion/IHT-indias-new-leader-singh-talks-of-peace-and-a-war-on-poverty.html), one week after he became the Prime Minister, and there you can see the strategy India followed for the next 10 years.",t5_2qh1q,Finally some intelligent discussion of Balakot air strike by former NSA Shivshankar Menon,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azxp53/finally_some_intelligent_discussion_of_balakot/

1547417724.0,2,23,7,"Hey,

I am 25.5 years old and my girlfriend just turned 23.

So I met this girl on Tinder and she is a gem of a person. She's a keeper and I am not letting her go.

I haven't been in a very long relationship ever because I belong to a conservative household. The longest I ever dated a girl was 1 month. Whereas, her parents are very cool.

While speaking to each other one day I found out that she has been in 4 relationships so far and she's had sex with 7 people and doesn't have any count on the number of times she's done it.

Now after knowing this I feel so insecure about my sexual inexperience. I feel like I haven't done anything fun in my life. I have had sex just once.

&amp;#x200B;

Not bragging or trolling. I am really insecure about it and it's affecting our relationship. Please give me serious replies only.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I am 25 years old. have had sex just once whereas my girlfriend doesn't have a count. She's done it with 7 people already and she's just 23. This is making me very insecure. Also I cannot stop imagining her doing it with her ex boyfriends. Please please advice",t5_2qh1q,Help! Insecure about my sexual inexperience!

Its the third day and I am feeling better already except for a killer headache that doesn't go away. I suspect the medicines I have been prescribed are very unnecessary. Never heard of any of them, ever.

Here is what has been prescribed:

* **Hifenac-P** (Hifenac P is prescribed to patients suffering from painful rheumatic conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.)
* **Oseltamivir Capsules IP (Antiflu 75mg)** - (Antiflu 75 mg Capsule is used in the treatment of infections of influenza virus types A and B.)
* **L Dio 1** ( L Dio 1 10 MG Tablet is a very effective and potent medication to treat year-round allergic symptoms associated with rhinitis and utricaria) 
* **Pantodac DSR** (Pantodac DSR capsule is a medicine used to prevent symptoms of vomiting or nausea, especially in people suffering from gastro-intestinal diseases) - I asked for something to prevent vomiting because I was throwing up everything I tried to eat or drink. Haven't taken this medicine as I started to feel better.
* **Emeset-4** (Emeset 4 MG Tablet is antiemetic drug used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by **cancer chemotherapy and radiation therapy**)

I travel between Ahmedabad and Delhi a lot and the Doctor suspects it could be swine flu. He asked to wait for few days and get a test done if my health doesn't improve.

However **Emeset** and **Hifenac** sound really over the top for what I have. I know this is not the place for medical advice but any information will help me here.

&gt;Rulers will become unreasonable: they will levy taxes

This one is obvious.

&gt;Rulers will no longer see it as their duty to promote spirituality, or to protect their subjects: they will become a danger to the world.

All the strife happening in various parts of this planet bear testimony to this.

&gt;People will start migrating, seeking countries where wheat and barley form the staple food source.

Mass emigration from Northern Africa and Arabian countries to Europe is a thing.

&gt;Avarice and wrath will be common. Humans will openly display animosity towards each other. Ignorance of dharma will occur.

We do this. All the time. In our own country at that.

&gt;Lust will be viewed as socially acceptable and sexual intercourse will be seen as the central requirement of life.

Reddit's echochamber resonates with this loudly.

&gt;Sin will increase exponentially, while virtue will fade and cease to flourish.

Amit Shah, Donald Trump et al can do whatever the fuck they want.

&gt;Women will no longer get married.

Fertility rates are going down and marriage ages are going up.

&gt;Traditional castes will disappear and everyone will belong to a single social class.

&gt;Brahmins will not be learned or honored, Kshatriyas will not be brave, Vaishyas will not be just in their dealings, and the varna system will be abolished.

In our own country, we are calling for this.

Now, I'm not saying that all of this is necessarily a bad thing. I just find it rather hard to believe that a document written thousands of years ago over a duration ranging from a few centuries to one millennium is accurately able to predict the state of this planet during this point of time.

I have not actively analysed the contents, and I have limited knowledge of Indian history to draw from, but something is really weird. Shit like this gives ammunition to those who would like to go back to the supposed good ol' days of the Vedas.

1548163505.0,2,18,33,"Hi reddit folks,
   Using a throwaway for this. I'm(24F) stuck in a rut and trying to find some help/advice here. I had an ok-paying job in an awesome city (Bangalore,India). Then I got an admit to a good bschool and will be pursuing my mba in a couple of months. And so, I had left my job  a month ago because I(..and pretty much everyone except my bad manager) felt it was a dead end job where I knew I would be stagnant. I wanted to start fresh reset my mind before I go to bschool.
I moved cities and moved into my parents house in Chennai. Its been one month and everything has taken a bad turn. My parents have their own issues. I feel like I maybe burdening them, though they say I am not. I thought I had a plan before coming here, an internship. Something. I am feeling lonely without my office friends. I have started double thinking everything in my life. Mainly my career and my love life(failed 2 attempts). My diet got messed up. I stopped going to the gym. In Bangalore, I got past my comfort zone to actually set a proper diet and go running every day for 5 days a week. I travelled. Now all that has gone to shit. When I came back to Chennai I went to my dad's gym and trained with a trainer there. I was on trial and given my base fitness I really loved the training here, even the trainer would take an interest in training me. But sometime after a week I had stopped. My trainer asks my dad what happened to me. My dad has to manage saying my health's bad. I have put on weight and have gone backwards to that mindset of ' too out of shape to go to the gym'. 
Career wise. I graduated as an Engineer. Shortly after became a graphic designer while simultaneously going for weekend acting classes as I wanted to be an actor. All this before I joined the IT services sector as I had got an on campus job offer.
Now that I am back and jobless before I go to bschool, I feel empty. Not aware as I left the newspaper reading habbit(used to love reading livemint/the economist). Seems like I don't know what I want anymore. I don't know what interests me anymore. I don't know what to do these 3-4 months! Added to this I really don't know what career path I want to take. This is all disappointing knowing I learn pretty much anything pretty quickly. My ex-team members liked me and my work and I had some purpose(though that was short lived, before I knew the job was dead end, no growth kinda job). Quite a few of my friends/colleagues have left the team with better job offers in hand. I am no where utilising my time or, mostly, my skills. I feel shitty.

Each day is a day of wastage. No excercise, overeating or skipping meals. Only 2 Coursera courses to keep me engaged. No social life. Fed up in the house. Yet everyone's telling me how precious these 4 months are and I shouldn't waste them. I wanted to travel elsewhere, far from home(northeast India) and stay there for 3 months. But with no job, my savings won't be enough to sail through. I don't want to borrow money from my parents and they take it on ego that I think their money is different from my money.

I need some help here. I'm pretty much going mad without venting it out to my family/anywhere. Hence I'm here.
Can you people help me. Advice. Anything at all.

Its a long post. Thank you for reading this!

He started shouting and all.
I just left. Was a really bad experience. Has this happened with anyone else too ?

1550062783.0,2,234,800,"Hi everyone!  


I'm from Lahore, Pakistan. Since my childhood, unlike lot of people around me, I always had a huge fascination with India. I always visualize India as an entity full of energy, passion, dreams. faith and an inspiration. To me it's not a country, it's a feeling which gives me adrenaline rush everytime I think about it. Coincidentally, I've one of my great friends from Amritsar now in Mumbai. I've subscribed Indian content (of almost all types) and follow it regularly. I'm huge fan of Indian music, cricket and much more.   


Given the slight more knowledge I've about India than many people around me in Pakistan, I've been labelled as 'Raw agent' many times by many of my friends in a lighter note. I work in Lahore and from 16th floor from my workstation I look at Ferozpur road that goes straight to Ferozpur, India.  One of my biggest wish in life,  if not the biggest one is to visit India, explore it and make great friends there. From Kashmir to Kerala, Gujrat to Arunchal Pradesh, I want to dissolve myself into the cultural diversity of India. To me, India is most unique of all countries containing satisfying diversity within. 

It really is disappointing sometimes to imagine that I won't be able to visit India :( My sister told me to keep faith and I'll be able to visit it one day. I really hope one day, one day maybe. Idk if you get this, it's intangible feeling associated with India I'm passionate about. Probably the closest relatable explanation of Johnty Rhodes naming her daughter ""India"".

1553837510.0,2,18,14,"Hello there !

I need some career advice. Here's a short background before I ask any advice

- Graduated in 2016 from an NIT in Comp Engg. Went downhill from First year, ended with 60%

- Caught in ML Hype and low self esteem skipped placements for GATE

- Flunked GATE exam because of insincerity in preparation, then irresponsibly kept myself entangled in govt exams to avoid jobs, finally understood this was eating me up from within

- Finally got an actual developer job in December 2017, currently working here on a company specific solution based on an open source application. 

Did pretty well for myself, all the responsibilities fall on me as of now because the team consists of just two people (rest 3 gradually left because of salary issues) - me and another web developer who is made to learn this platform while she is being burdened with generic work.

All in all, my skills are now limited to Python and MySQL and this platform. Now my uncle almost an year ago, setup a meet with this guy who has recommended me to quit my current job and move to Pune/Bengaluru for a job (that's how he did it), also recently her wife recommended the same and said time is ticking off and you'll be regretting if you will be late in reaching those places. Also, my company is pretty lazy about being prompt in paying salaries (I need to keep calling the accounts guy for my cheque and salary is always late, however they keep claiming things will be better, also there has been some lethargy from my side asking for salary because of this frustration I guess now need become a hawk as far as salary is concerned)

Also I've got my resumes sent to 2 people who have contacts in TCS but have received no calls as of yet.

Also, recently :

&gt; Yes I did get one recently because LinkedIN made my profile on Shine.com. After I told her I'm working not in Bengaluru but in Gujarat. **She said when you come to bangalore call me back and she hung up**. Hence this quit and shift to bangalore seems sensible. Also once I got a call from Intel, and when I said I worked in Gujarat she let out a big ooooh. Finally I wasn't selected there too but that was not just the location I did bungle up a very fundamental Python question.

&gt;India had informed about Counter Terrorism (CT) action it took yesterday against a training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Pakistan based on credible evidence that JeM intended to launch more attacks. Against this Counter Terrorism Action, Pakistan has responded this morning by using its Air Force to target military installations on the Indian side. Due to our high state of readiness and alertness, Pakistan’s attempts were foiled successfully.

&gt;The Pakistan Air Force was detected and the Indian Air Force responded instantly. In that aerial engagement, one Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by a MiG 21 Bison of the Indian Air Force. The Pakistani aircraft was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side. In this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one MiG 21. The pilot is missing in action. Pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts.

Highlights

* Indian Air Force officer addresses first. Pakistan Air Force planes were intercepted. In the aerial combat, one F-16 aircraft was shot down by an IAF MiG Bison. IAF lost one MiG, he says and refers to the capture of the IAF pilot. 
* Pakistan resorted to indiscriminate firing on Feb. 26 and was befittingly retalitated.  Given the high level of preparedness Pak designs were foiled.  We are in a heightened state of alert, he (Army Maj. Gen Bahal) says. 
* Navy remains poised in all three dimensions to defeat Pakistan's provocations. 
* AVM Kapoor says piece of evidence is being presented about the aircraft being used by Pakistan based on electronic signature.  Pakistan media reports showing engine parts were not of MiG 21s, he says adding that it could be concluded that F-16s were used.

1552670220.0,2,57,62,"That person is me and i am standing here all alone. 

I will be 29 in some months and i am the elder son of my family. My father just retired and slowly the responsibilities will come on to my shoulders. If you have something you could tell me , and decide to read further, know that once i do the act, during that time i would be showering all my love for you. I have lost all hope of having a life and being a burden on this world.
 
* I was a good student in school,in fact i was in the top,had some good programming skills then or i am not sure - it might be mugging up the whole programs and dump it out in the final exam. I even got a medal from my school with scoring 100/100 in computer science. You will see the irony of this later.

* Fucked up my 12th in science because i was homesick and had a tough time living in a hostel and because i was weak at maths. Now at this age, if you ask me some calculus which people do remember at my age - i do not. Not even 1 %. What that tells you about me?

* Prepared for medical entrance for a year paid by my father's hard earned money. Nothing came out of it. I was halfway into it and halfway hoping as if luck would be showered upon me and i would get through the entrance. But reality struck hard.

* Did Engineering in Instrumentation technology (a core stream ) from a good private college with good cgpa like around 8.5/10. But you know how i got it- i got through initial  1st 3 years studying and giving it somehow but the 4th year was tough for me- i cheated in the exams for almost all the subjects with chits and chits of paper i wrote in a minutes. 
I cheated through the exaams because i knew it was too tough for me to actually make sense of the subjects and i was afraid i might not even pass.

But all this was of no use anyway- that degree is just a certificate in a file now and is not worth a rupee now because on paper i am so and so engineer but in real life, i am a loser who has actually forgotten almost all of which i studied in those years. I guarantee that people are there who still know the fundamentals of a subject and can even give the exams after many years in engineering but i was not. My memory failed me or i caused my memory to fail - in any case i cannot remember anything of that Btech.

* Got placed in IT starting with the a company starting with the letter I - you know which one- in spite of having no spectacular programming skills and because it was not Xth std Comp Science which i had a false notion that i will be good at it and thus i chose to go with the company. 

* During the training period itself, i came to know that its too hard for me to do any actual programming. Passed after failing and giving a retest with literally some help from other kind trainees. Still i stayed there. I never left because you see on paper, i had passed but in reality i had failed.

* Got posted in Mangalore, lived there alone in a 1 RK.

* Wasted 4 years there, literally wasted in a support project where due to my inability, which may be they saw through me or just randomly , i was handed the L1 part-doing triage of the issues , and open a ticket, write a select query in Teradata, give that information to the client. Just that. Why nothing more ? Because i was too dumb to actually code or solve a real problem.

* Transferred to Bhubaneswar nearby to my home last year - just for the sake of it. I am still in the company, was on bench for almost a year and could not get project because i had no skills.
But they did not kick me out or neither i voluntarily did that.

* I am in a project right now which i got at the end of the year where they use TM1, Cognos, INFORMATICA, Unix, DB2. I literally don't know any of the technologies. Searching here and there, getting called by the leads as dumb, doing the least basic task which the lead has to explain to me - this is my life now.
On top of that , i keep on forgetting things which the lead would have told me the last week. 

I do not even understand the code other people have written in the existing systems, i do not understand how they would come up with such complex logic.

* I have lost the ability or may be never had logical reasoning skills which is needed to do programming - be it any language. I don't have the ability to think of a solution to any programming requirement, do not have the skill to divide the problem into blocks and solve it 1 by1. This is not Xth class stuff - this is the real world.
I have even lost the ability to even think of something to approach the problem.

This is my wasteful life. You know what i do instead of trying to improve - i indulge in viewing tv shows, podcasts,youtube anything to just pass time and not do something constructive.

I am a listless person with no energy to face the world. I do not have any skills to even get a different job. By the age of 29, people more or less figure how to earn for their family but i have still not figured out - nor i have the energy to think of it. 

**What is the point of living such a life ?**

I have procastinated, i have wasted my years when people try to make something out of themselves and people i know who were once below me in skills have gone on to try, struggle and are succeeding in their lives. But i did not.

Why should i exist when i am the burden on my world now (my father and mother although they are trying to help me but they cannot because i have reached the end) ? 

I am a wasteful, pathetic loser in life now.I do not even an ounce of energy to solve my problems. I somehow think if i take out myself out of the equation of lives of my family and they somehow forget that i ever existed, it will be great. I have no friends now as well.

I do not blame anyone for the condition i am in right now, it was me and me only. In spite of knowing that i am wasting time and instead of doing something constructive - anything, i indulge in viewing shows/songs/podcasts just to fill that time and get that moment of fleeting happiness.

Now dear reader, if you have read this far of my wasteful life i have lived, what will you tell me? That there is still hope - but i know there isn't. That somehow you will come out of it - but i know this will never happen.

Why should i not jump out of this balcony i am standing now and end this constant misery i am in? 

Why?

[https://imgur.com/1rAcfKb](https://imgur.com/1rAcfKb) (pic of the dog as well as the X-ray)

Guys,  I am a member of the Society for Non-Human Persons, a body of  individuals who have come together to give a better life to the animals  on the campus of NLSIU - a prestigious law school situated in Bangalore.  I do understand that it is a *very* long shot but would like to try nonetheless.

We  have a dog on campus which was hit by a vehicle some time ago, and at  that time no one got the poor dog treated and rather just tied up the  wound to maintain pressure, unfortunately, the bones started healing in  the awkward position itself and recently the dog got ran over by a car  just outside the gate. As luck would have it, the fractured bone was  broken again and while we were able to get her to the vet asap, he  suggested that she should undergo a surgery which costs about 15k.  Adding to the problem, she is pregnant. If she does not undergo surgery,  she will be in constant pain for the rest of her life as the new  fracture is much worse and the nerves pass through the same area. We have  approached multiple shelters, pro-animal-rights organizations as well as  enthusiastic alums and while some of the extremely generous college  peeps have donated as much as they can, and so have the committee  members, we have been able to reach \~8-9k. The committee, unfortunately,  receives zero funds from the college and so can not approach the  administration for help. The surgery is to take place *tomorrow*.  While I understand financial support might not be viable, I would also  be eternally grateful to anyone who could, alternatively, foster her for a couple of  days after surgery (I will personally pay for all the medication). We have nothing from which we could possibly pay you guys back, but  words fail me when I try to describe the sheer gratitude and  indebtedness at the mere thought of any assistance in this regard.

Facebook: fb/SNHPNLS \[let me know in the comments if you require any additional proof\]

Long  time lurker, I don't care about being doxxed as I saw my pet almost  bleed to death in front of my eyes when I was \~10 and can not bear the  thought of witnessing this poor dog live a life of pain and neither can I  bear orphaning her pups.

Lots of Love &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Thank you everyone who wanted to help. I was down with dengue right after I put this up so couldn't coordinate and then forgot to update.

1547620852.0,2,11,72,"Came across this study that examines what happens when highly educated Indians from different caste and religious backgrounds apply for jobs in the modern urban private sector, encompassing multinational corporations as well as prominent Indian companies.

[This](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40276548?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) is the link to the paper.

TLDR:

&gt;The economist and Ambedkarite scholar Sukhdeo Thorat, and his co-author, US-based sociologist Paul Attewell, posted dummy résumés of candidates in response to advertisements for entry-level jobs in leading newspapers in the country.

&gt;For each vacancy, three résumés were sent. All the résumés were identical in almost all respects (with the same educational qualifications and suitable degrees from reputed universities) but they differed when it came to the caste and religion of the candidate. While caste and creed were not mentioned explicitly in the résumé, in each trio of résumés, one had a distinctly upper-caste surname, one a Dalit surname and one a Muslim surname.

&gt;Thorat and Attewell then analysed the response patterns from firms. Their findings, published in a 2007 Economic and Political Weekly research paper, were striking.

&gt;**The ones with Muslim surnames had the lowest chance of being selected for an interview, followed by those with Dalit surnames. Candidates with upper-caste surnames faced significantly brighter prospects.**

Most of today's generation is facing sever mental health issues and the same generation is working in corporates all day without much exposure to sunlight (affecting Vitamin D levels in body). Also, the daily diet is easy home delivered food (instead home cooked) which lacks nourishment affecting Vitamin B.

Talking about seasonal depression (which many face during winters or monsoons) might be because Sun exposure is again low. Co-incidence? I think not.

&gt; Meera Sanyal, 57, had joined the Aam Aadmi Party after quitting her job as the country chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, and contested a Lok Sabha election in 2014

&gt; She was a noted figure in the economic circles was awarded as Philanthropist of the Year by Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry (FICCI) in 2011. 

&gt; As an AAP activist, Sanyal was instrumental in the petition that challenged Mumbai Port Trust’s handling of coal imports in Mumbai’s Haji Bunder port area. She pointed out that the area spread across 25 acres was facing environmental and health threats due to negligence on the part of MbPT.

&gt; Sanyal also authored a book entitled ‘The Big Reverse: How Demonetization Knocked India Out’. 

&gt; She reportedly left various Whatsapp groups of AAP members last month, saying she wanted a ‘detox’ from social media.

&gt; Vice Admiral (retd), president of APLI Mumbai, a non-governmental organisation, hailed Sanyal’s ability to bring together people from diverse walks of life with the objective of formulating public policies. “She had charisma to attract the young talent, old people and others to formulate the public policies,” said Rao.

1551795093.0,2,8,7,"I often read up posts of people who are depressed, without work and in need of money here on this sub. I would like to share on this platform information about Lionbridge with whom I have been working for some time. Most of the r/workonline opportunities don't work in India. You need a laptop/desktop and good googling skills and decent internet.

Link of their website: http://www.thesmartcrowd.com/workers/job-opportunities/country/india/#jobs-list

Let me share the process:

First of all you need to upload your CV and answer their preliminary questions.

Fair warning: The complete process from uploading you application to getting your first payment may take 4 months easily depending on how well you progress.

If they feel you are the right fit, they get back and give you access to a 200 page document from which you will be tested.

You then get access to the final exam for which you are given 1 week to 10 days to complete. This is the tricky part as many people have written on r/workonline that you need to answer above 80% to pass the test.

Now all this is unpaid work from your side, you may have to spend between 10-20 hours to read the guidelines and give the test.

If you fail the test, which is very very likely in first attempt, they usually get back to you to give another chance and the whole process repeats.

After passing the test, you may get complete access in 5-10 days and you start rating. The payment is monthly in you bank account via SWIFT. First payment comes ~40 days after the end of the month whenever you start.

Doing their minimum work depending on which program you are working, you can easily earn 10k doing minimum work and I have known people who have been earning 40-60k per month doing the max grind which is 20hrs/week and 80hrs/month.

The tasks are repetitive and you will easily get bored but that's the job. For example, in one job you may be checking accuracy of businesses and their map location while in other you may be looking up what you think of the results which pop-up.

This type of work is very useful to major internet giants who make the AI think like a human. The pay rates are shitty compared to what they pay globally but that's about it.

PS:If you have any questions, would be happy to answer. Also, if you have personal experience with any work from home opportunity, please share in comments.

1550506214.0,2,27,7,"In the middle of all the carnage and chest thumping, I cannot seem to figure out what is the end game in Kashmir for India, Pakistan and the Kashmiris?  

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see it there are 4 possible ways to solve this. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. India invades Pakistan and takes back Kashmir.   

\- This essentially means a nuclear war and I don't see any Government  (right wing or otherwise)  being OK with tens of millions of their people dying and the countries thrown back in to stone age.  

2.   Plebiscite in Kashmir with option to join either India or Pakistan as per UN resolution? 

\- No Government in India will  agree to this and the UN resolution is worded so vaguely that it is impossible to implement. 

3.  Independent Kashmir. 

\- No Government in India or , I believe, Pakistan is going to agree to this.  

   4. Make Line of Control the actual border. 

\- While this seems like a reasonable solution, there will be a lot of opposition by the Pakistan army(which essentially runs the country) given the number of lives lost and for any Government in India, giving up the ""Kashmir is an integral part of India""line,  is essentially political suicide. Not to mention the Kashmiris who won't really jump with joy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot see any of the 4 solutions being feasible. So, the only way forward I can see is the status quo where we fight a low intensity war where no win will win and hundred of Soldiers and civilians will die.

I studied my 11th intermediate in Deeksha junior college and had a triple experience studying there, I wasn’t really sure of what to do in my life since I thought I could live with the natural flow. I joined a SSC college and realised that apart from JEE/NEET coaching there really wasn’t anything else. In Hyderabad, out of 10 colleges that I picked almost 10 of them were running with only JEE/NEET coaching. I was disheartened because all my dreams of becoming a lawyer that I have developed later in grade 11 have shattered. Our country or atleast our city is has Institutions running just to produce Engineers and Docters. The IPE education that’s the basic education I was receiving was also bloody terrible. Pardon my language. As suicidal thoughts emerged another institution called PAGE popped into my head they were offering a good amounts of various coaching s such as CLAT,SAT/TOEFL/GRE,BITSAT and many more courses I was overflown in happiness I th goth I could begin my progress for becoming a lawyer, but as I proceeded for admission in the month of March,at which point of time the results of my 11th IPE exams hadn’t come out yet, I was informed that if I don’t manage to clear all my subject I would have to discontinue in the institution. I was sure I wasn’t going to clear my MATH 1A thanks to the poor and inconsistent staff in my college. I’m a cent percent sure about passing in all the rest subjects but then what has put our education system down is that where in the next 5-6 years of my education in a law school while doing LLM or BscLLB will I be taught math. I agree that being knowledges about basic math is important but in my case I’m expecting at least 65/75 in my MATH 1B paper. But surprisingly my opportunity to join a course I wish is dragged away.

**Venue**: Zayed Sports City Stadium, Abu Dhabi, Capacity: 50,000

**Time**: 9:30 PM IST

**Opponent** : United Arab Emirates are not only the hosts, but also a strong team. At FIFA ranking of 79, they are reasonably higher than us on the ladder and will have the home advantage as well. In the first game, playing against lower ranked Bahrain, they only managed a 1-1 draw with a dubious penalty. Blue Tigers will feel they can challenge the hosts for a good game.

**Where to watch?** : The game will be available on Star Sports, Jio, Hotstar. The users not in India can join us at /r/IndianFootball on match thread. We may have some more information about other options for the streaming on the day.

**Lineups**: Indian coach Stephen Constantine made a surprise selection of starting young prospect Ashique Kuruniyan ahead of experienced, but out of form striker, Jeje Lalpekhlua. The strategy paid dividends as Kuruniyan earned the penalty for Indian team and was a stand-out player of the game. India will probably start with the same line up against UAE as well.

*Starting XI* : Gurpreet Singh, Anas Edathodika, Sandesh Jhingan, Subashish Bose, Pritam Kotal, Pronay Halder, Anirudh Thapa, Halicharan Narzary, Udanta Singh, Sunil Chhetri, Ashique Kuruniyan.

*Subs*: Narayan Das, Amrinder Singh, Balwant Singh, Jackichand Singh, Vinit Rai, Sumeet Passi, Salam Singh, Vishal Kaith, Sarthak Golui.

**Tactics** : If you want to know about India's playing style, [this post by /u/curtainh8r](https://greyareaanalytics.com/blog/afc-asia-cup-2019-thailand-vs-india-tactical-analysis) should give you a good idea.

**Would you like to see any changes from India? What are your predictions for the game? Can India pull off a draw, or may be even a win? Come, discuss on our pre-match and match threads at /r/IndianFootball.

I am trying to parse Ravi Shastri's response. He states that

1. When O'Keefe opens his canteen
2. Mayank Agarwal will come personally to the canteen
3. He will then smell the canteen's coffee
4. Mayank would then want to compare this smell to the different types of coffee smell back in India
5. Then he will make a determination of which coffee is better - the ones in India or O'Keefe's canteen.

My question is -

1. Why did Mayank make this highly particular intent of his known to Ravi Shastri?
2. Why is O'Keefe's plans of opening a canteen not more widely reported by presstitute media?
3. Are the rumors true - That the coffee in O'Keefe's canteen will cost tree-fiddy?",t5_2qh1q,Ravi Shastri's comments about O'Keefe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aber36/ravi_shastris_comments_about_okeefe/

It's just a young bloke speaking his mind on an already controversial subject. Social justice has been whipped up to inhuman standards recently.

We have cricket officials and public figures trying to scuttle a talented cricketers career over something utterly insignificant.

Meanwhile, Salmon Khan can continue acting despite having driven over and killed people with his car while drunk.


*what Pandya said -*

""Why don't you ask women's names at nightclubs?"" asked Johar when Hardik replied saying he struggles in remembering names of the women he interacts with during such parties. ""I like to watch and observe how they move. I'm little from the Black side so I need to see how they move,"" Pandya responded.

He dwelled onto his sex life suggesting, ""When I lost my virginity, I came home and said, Main karke aaya hai aaj (I did it today)”. Further highlighting the casual take on the subject from his parents, the 25-year-old revealed how ""cool"" he is with his family members. 

At a party my parents asked me acha tera wala (women) kaun sa hai (Which are your women)? I said yeh, yeh, yeh (pointing out women) and they were like waah proud of you beta,"" Pandya asserted.

Another question from Karan Johar that attracted a debatable response from the two cricketers was, ""If you all hit on the same women, then how do you decide?"". Rahul answered saying, ""up to the woman"" while an outspoken Hardik said: ""Nahi nahi aisa kuch nahi hai, talent pe hota hai. Jisko mila woh leke jao (Nothing like that, it's about talent, whoever gets them, takes them)""

#[](#icon-notes-big) Introduction

Returning to the AFC Asian Cup for only the 4th time ever, India will be looking to improve on their performance back in the 2011 edition of the competition. Back then, India were paired in a group consisting of favorites Australia and South Korea while Bahrain, a regular decent Asian side, also featured. India lost all three matches, with all three pretty much decided by halftime, but the fact that India participated was what mattered. This was India's first Asian Cup appearance in 27 years, since 1984.

***1964 and 1984***

India first participated in the AFC Asian Cup in 1964, the competitions 3rd edition. India qualified automatically after all other teams in the Western Zone of qualification withdrew. Despite that, India showed why they deserved to be in the competition by finishing as the tournament runners-up. They started with a 2-1 victory over South Korea, followed by 2-0 defeat by hosts Israel, and finally a 3-1 victory over Hong Kong. This would be India's best finish in the tournament.

India would fail to qualify for the Asian Cup until 1984, when they finished 2nd in Group 3 during qualification. However, unlike 20 years earlier, India couldn't make it out of the group stage and ended last in Group B (consisting of China, Iran, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore).

***Path to 2019***

India's path to the 2019 AFC Asian Cup began in 2015 with the qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Despite being in a group consisting of Iran, Oman, Turkmenistan, and Guam, India finished in last place, with only 1 victory and 7 defeats. This meant that India didn't qualify for the World Cup and the Asian Cup automatically but instead had to go through another two rounds of qualification for the Asian Cup.

India were drawn to play against Laos in the play-in round for Asian Cup qualification. Following a 1-0 victory in Leg 1, India managed to destroy their opposition in the second leg 6-1 (7-1 aggregate). India now had one more round of qualification to go through. They were placed in Group A consisting of Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, and Macau. India managed to comfortably qualify after winning 4 of their matches, drawing once as well.

#[](#icon-info-big) Players to Watch

[**Gurpreet Singh Sandhu**](http://blog.cpdfootball.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150228-gurpreet-singh-sandhu-1.jpg): The 26-year-old goalkeeper has 26 caps for India. A product of East Bengal, Sandhu moved to play in Europe in 2013 when he joined Norweigan side Staebek. He was the club's 2nd choice goalkeeper but played in the Europa League qualifiers with them before returning to India and joining Bengaluru. He played a massive part in Bengaluru finishing 1st in ISL last season and did well in the ISL Final. He is tall (6 ft, 4 inches), can stretch really well for saves,. and commands his defense well. Weakness is probably his agility but he makes up for it by making himself big in major moments.

[**Sandesh Jhingan**](https://www.sportsindiashow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sandesh-jhingan.jpg): 25-year-old centerback with Kerala Blasters. Came out of nowhere after okay performances in the I-League. Joined the Blasters in 2014 and has now become captain. 6 foot 2 inches, he is a good reader of plays, isnt afraid to get stuck in and tackle, and good at heading the ball away or in on corners for India. Weakness can be that he tends to be rash and is a walking yellow card.

[**Sunil Chhetri**](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201806/12_0_0.png?kU1RHdHlAjNbmryKAa9_dp1l6XcHieBL): India's main man and arguably best player EVER. 34 years old but despite that, has 65 goals in 103 games, a lot of them coming in the last 4 years! Has played abroad in the United States and Portugal, he is India's posterboy and still does well in the Indian Super League for Bengaluru. This season he has 5 goals in 11 matches. Physically very strong but agile as well. Technical ability is great and his finishing is out of this world

[**Jeje Lalpekhlua**](https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fiaa.jpg): Expected to be India's starting striker, the 27-year-old Mizo has done well since making his debut in 2011. Has 22 goals in 52 matches. Whether he will do well here is questioned right now as he isn't in the best form. This season for Chennaiyin in the Indian Super League, Lalpekhlua has not scored a single goal from 11 matches. Last season he managed 9 goals from 20 matches.

[**Udanta Singh**](https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/06/udanta-759.jpg): The 22-year-old speedster is one of India's best young talents. Great dribbling skills, decent passer of the ball, and good off the ball, Udanta will be one to look out for at the Asian Cup. Will be relied upon for the counter. Weakness is his finishing.

**Notable Mention**: Rowllin Borges and Anas Edathodika

#[](#icon-discuss-big) Points of Discussion

- **The Coach: Stephen Constantine**: India's coach for the Asian Cup is Stephen Constantine. The Englishman will be coaching a side in the competition for the first time. He is credited with helping India improve drastically in the FIFA rankings. When he arrived, India were ranked 173. India is now 97. However, it can also be noted that he was India's coach during their horrendous World Cup qualification campaign, overseeing bad results such as a defeat to Guam. The players have also been reportedly vocal over their dislike of the coach, including Sunil Chhetri. Despite this, Constantine has helped India become a more cohesive unit and more organized than they were under the Dutchman, Wim Koevermans. He has also given opportunities to young players but has also be criticized for not selected all the best players and having favorites, many of which don't play for their club sides. Tactically, Constantine prefers either a 4-2-3-1 or 4-4-2. He has been noted of using route 1 football.

- **Our Predictions**

 - /u/EnglishHooligan
: Expected India to lose all 3 matches but hopefully not as badly as 2011. United Arab Emirates are tournament hosts and will be looking at this match as the match to go all out, at least in the first half. Thailand and Bahrain will also look for 3 points against us as the strategy will be whoever doesn't get 3 points against India would be knocked-out. Honestly, not upset if we lose all 3 games. Losing them would mean our coach would be sacked. Still won't be rooting for defeat.

 - /u/konoha_ka_ladka
: We are the weakest team in the group no doubt. So expecting us to finish last. But luck has been on our side recently and good sides haven't been able to finish inspite of creating plenty of chances against us, case in point 0-0 draw with China. Hence a hoping for a positive result vs Thailand or Bahrain.

1549215546.0,7,1,0,"Ok this will be controversial because judging the best captain isn't as simple as looking at Win%. Win% has lots to do with ability of the Captain as a leader but also  (a) capabilities of the team they are leading (b) capability of the opposition they play in that era (c) home games, away games (d) Era they led the team and I am sure countless other variables. Well I still chose to state my opinion and asking for agreements or counter arguments - just for the fun of it.

&amp;#x200B;

However controversial, here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

Captain that wins more matches: Kohli; Followed by Dhoni and Ganguly (No surprises here but not so fair).

Captain that gave the biggest boost to Indian team: Ganguly; Followed by Kapil Dev and then Kohli.

If you take a 30,000-foot-view (sorry for consulting cliche), Ganguly, Kapil Dev and Kohli did lead Indian crickets' transition in their respective eras. They improved by quite a bit from what was handed over to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Winner of the Best Indian Captain (so far): Ganguly;

Why: Transformational leadership\*\*.\*\* Gave biggest boost to the Indian team. Admittedly, Ganguly part of that boost because Tendulkar didn't do the best of job as a captain and faced tons of politics for team selection. Although, I am positively sure Ganguly faced them too and was able to get his way off-field. Ganguly got an attitude change in Indian cricket that was never seen before. Add to that, Dravid who followed Ganguly didn't do better than what Ganguly left him. Dhoni, our ODI world cup winning captain, greatest finisher of the game - should have gotten a much larger boost from when he took over the reigns from Dravid or Ganguly Win%. About him not winning WC -  ODI world cup is just one tournament that happens every 4 years and just one format of the game, entire captaincy career cannot be judged based on that.

&amp;#x200B;

Agree or Disagree - why?

I'm going to be traveling India through March and looking for Gyms that offer day passes. It's mainly traveling so going to the gym is somewhat optional, though I want to have that option to visit a gym.

I'm going to travel from Dehli to Mumbai through Rajasthan state. I know there's many Gold's Gym, Anytime Fitness around, but I'm not a member in either.  Do they accept walk-ins?

I don't want to become a frequent member and pay for any sort of plan.

For those who may not be aware, it's a free Wi-Fi service provided by the Indian Railways at numerous railway stations across India. I have some time to kill and like always I fired up the Reddit application on my phone to check what's new. But I couldn't connect to the Reddit servers and initially I assumed it could be an issue with the application so I opened up the browser and tried connecting but still the same. So I tried to connect through my Airtel network and both the application and the browser were able to connect. 

Never expected this to happen since I was able to connect last month when I was traveling over the Wi-Fi service. This is getting out of hand now. I mean banning Reddit? That's ridiculous.

&amp;nbsp;


If you've been using any music streaming service in the past few years- be it a website, the radio or music channels, you may have noticed that at least in the metros, there has been an increasing number of Punjabi songs being played.
Infact, my SoundCloud's Top 50 Charts is dominated by Punjabi singers with the exception of the odd Hindi Bollywood song, some English and a couple Korean.

&amp;nbsp;

A lot of this could be traced back to the explosion of Yo Yo Honey Singh in Bollywood earlier this decade. Following Honey Singh, in Bollywood itself, we've seen party music shift from Hinglish to something more Haryanvi (a mixture of Punjabi and Hindi, largely spoken in and around Delhi) and English. Leading this charge is Baadshah and Guru Randhawa, and both of them have had many bangers in the past 4-5 years.

Besides these two, we've had Diljeet Dosanjh, Jasmine Sandlas, Harrdy Sandhu and this year, Jass Manak, Mankirat Aulakh and many more.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm linking a couple of my favourite songs from this boom below:

[Gwandian](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gEWdfSTlojU) by Dr. Zeus

[Lahore](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ0fwJojhrs) by Guru Randhawa

[Toronto](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7N-D4hDscEw) by Jass Manak

[Gaal Ni Kadni](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=U65TWIP3mpQ) by Parmesh Verma

[Lamberghini](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5X7WWVTrBvM) by The Doorbeen

My Story- My brother consumed some Bhang (Indian Hemp) that all of us eat as Prasadam, followed by some more given by his friends but he was unaware. He slept around 2 pm after playing Holi and woke-up (came to his consciousness) on the 3rd day. Got up, took shower, wore his evening clothes and started putting Gulal on everyone.

The problem isn't limited to Holi. I feel similar emotions when I'm forcefully pulled into dancing at parties. It just makes me miserable and makes me want to skip such parties altogether. Just let me enjoy in my own way for God's sake!

I know I'm not alone. There are many like me. I'm guessing people assume that we're shy and try to help by forcing us out of our shyness, so that we can ""learn have some fun"".

1551899871.0,1,52,30,"Let me just preface this by stating that this is absolutely serious, and I would like all of your nsights and opinions on it. 

So, I was attending a birthday party at a friend's place, and she is a huge fan of 'Paani-Puri' so she had the components spread out on her dinner table. Everyone was sort of seated near it and assembling it and eating. 

Now, I know for a fact that I am incapable of assembling and eating one of them without making a huge mess. It has always been the case. Also, I usually do not like to spend too much time assembling and eating them - it is just too tiresome and tedious. 

So I have this system which involves me taking all the ingredients - crushed puri, the spicy water, the sweet chutney and the ragda and mixing them together in one large bowl and having it with a spoon. 

I did this, and literally the entire room of people stopped and stared at me. Several of them were recording and stuff. My closest friends know I always eat like this, so they were sort of desensitised to it, but it quickly became the topic of discussion for the rest of the evening. 

Some other people tried it as well, while majority of the people were just too shaken up. Some were almost scandalised, so to say. Word spread, and now pretty much all my friends come up to me in college(I am in the student council, so pretty much everyone knows me) and bring up the ""paani-puri"" incident.

Memes have been born from this incident.  Videos and vines titled ""9,001+ IQ Way of Eating Paani-Puri"" have become commonplace among my friendcircle. A Drake meme where he rejects a plate of normally assembled Paani-Puri and then approves of a ""bowl"" of the mixture has also been sent to some of the groups. The meme where the guy with his shining brain/intellect increasing with every panel has also been adapted to fit my style of Paani-Puri eating. All in good fun, though, nothing malicious. Just a joke. 



Anyway, I wanted to know if anyone else does this? Or is it just me? If you have never tried it, I urge you to! It is so convenient and simple, it saves you so much of time and effort.

This time, I got a fake. No scoop, no importer sticker and the protein smelled weird. On asking for a return, the delivery guy refused to accept it. For the past four days I have been talking to the customer service and escalating the issue, but to no avail. All they do is assuring and saying that they will ""Keep creating returns which will definitely be picked up by the delivery agent."" and when the delivery agent comes, he refuses the pickup and tells me to call customer service which again leads to the same cycle of him refusing and me calling customer service. The customer service tells me that there's no other way in which I can get the refund excepting for the order getting picked up.

1552752924.0,1,41,91,"This is about the parental addiction to IIT coaching for their children. This has been happening for quite a long time. Indian parents are pushing their children to get coaching in IIT from a young age. The earliest I've heard was one of my 11th class batchmates telling me that he had been undergoing entrance exam coaching since 8th std. You might know even more extreme cases. An overwhelming majority of these students are forced by their parents and their childhood gets sacrificed.  These students don't get a chance to experience the growing up stage properly and to be well rounded individuals. They are often set up to get depressed in their adult life because they would be working on something they are not at all interested in, or worse they don't have any jobs.

So like the alcohol ban, PUBG ban etc, we need a IIT coaching ban in India since IIT coaching is misused by parents. Once the ban is in place, people running underground IIT coaching centers and parents who send their children there should be arrested by police and then let go with a warning. Repeated offenders should get significant jail time. Any student should feel free to report their parents , if they are pressurized to study for IIT. We can start with the coaching ban in Rajastan. Lots and lots of depressed souls in Kota can finally get relief.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Parents pressurizing and harassing their children and enrolling them at coaching centers against their will is a serious concern. I have seen several instances of this in my life. I am sure many of you would have seen this too. The child protection laws in India is a joke. One of the reasons, I posted this is because we have become a ban trigger happy society having the mentality of banning things we don't like and depriving people who enjoy these things. I understand that there could be some students who enjoy going to the coaching centers. They deserve to be able to go to these coaching centers. The recent events where people were arrested for playing PUBG is ridiculous. I know banning is not the way to go for any of the above cases. But a majority of people are happy or not concerned about these bans because it doesn't concern them. What ban will it take for people to finally wake up?

1. Android TV box is simply a TV box running the Android operating system. All mainstream network entities like hotstar , voot, sony liv have their own dedicated app version for android boxes.
2. Most Tvs nowadays are coming with android interface being officially certified by google so it will only get better with time.
3. There are some unofficial apps in grey market which are really reliable for live tv and are totally free meaning your expense will only be about internet plan plus even official apps gives huge discount mostly like few days ago Sony liv 6 month membership was around 50 rs.
4. Hide adult or profanity things. I cannot view Youtube Trending page at all.
5. Support for Android and google home devices. You can use your phone to cast media and google is also bringing support of identifying a person(already present on google home) meaning it will automatically change youtube recommendations according to your preference and your family preference.
6. Before it was only limited to cheap chinese boxes with lack of LTS but now android boxes made by Xiaomi and Nvidia really put them in main market with google project treble.
7. Why I said it is better than firestick is because you are not just limited to bloated amazon interface or lack of usb slot(perfect to use mouse) but you can install different launchers using play store and also easily sideload apps so most of the perks of android. Prime video sideloaded works perfectly.

Google ""chigztech"" to get a detailed chart comparing all android boxes because there are just so many and prefer to use chinese sites (don't worry about customs) to buy it than indian ones as they are way overpriced.

1549206125.0,1,12,0,"We Indians take a perverse sense of patriotism by bashing PewDiePie and supporting the 'Bollywood' media conglomerate, T-Series. No doubt, as an approximation of retribution for the almost 200 years long British Raj. Our people also don't shy away from the racist slurs we could imagine.

From creepy online predators (the friends of Mr Bob Vegana who like lasagna a lot) to scammers (IRS/Tech support just search on YouTube) we do have our fair share of weirdos.
PewDiePie and the whole world mostly knows us by our online avatar plus 'bollywood' (what a tragically pathetic name!) shenanigans. Which doesn't give an outside viewer the right idea of our nation.

Sure, PewDiePie is a troll (although he doesn't go all out nowadays unlike his alleged Nazi Sympathising jokes in the past) and our brothers and sisters simply took the bait resulting into a unity that the nation has seen on rare occasions. What does it result into? Chunks of profit to all parties involved, PewDiePie, T-Series and YouTube (the platform has seen more users engaged and hence monetisation heaven.)

There is a silver lining to this. If you consider the massive support both parties have been able to garner, we could (in theory) use that level of international syndication to our advantage. Imagine such a large force of driven people striving to spread awareness about important issues. Cancer, science literacy, international human rights threats, or (my favourite) coming up with a better system of governance by which we may improve our lives along with ensuring that the future survives.

It was quite disturbing to watch that. Crops being grown on toxic water as they have no other choice. Worst part is they're aware of the consequences, the diseases and conditions it'll bring upon them and yet they're forced by circumstances to consume it as its almost impossible to sell such polluted / low-quality yield. Sushil Mahapatra then interviews the villagers, one couple says they have skin problems and many others in the village have it too, then there are some scary cancer statistics mentioned in the report by the health minister of Haryana himself.  
I believe this is the news, people need to be aware of issues like these occurring around our country. This is a totally unnecessary suffering, I do not know the solution to this, but I would like to see governments at least taking initiative to solve these or at least take interest in these issues. They've been suffering from this for years that now it has just become a way of life for them. God knows when will Prime Times will host debates on these or question local leaders on these things. Its very sad.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't know if this is the right sub. Point me to it if this isn't.

I purchased Microsoft Office 2016 Pro Plus keys from [oemkeys.in](https://oemkeys.in) on 18th December. I was waiting for an year end sale. Prices shown on the site were very lucrative and with discounts. So, naive me took the decision of paying them Rs.1439.10.

I was told to create an account on the website for payment. I did. The confirmation came almost instantaneously in the form of a series of mails - one for account confirmation, one for payment confirmation and one (after about 5 minutes) for the key. I will directly paste what was written below the key in the mail I received

&gt;""Key required to activate within 3 DAYS, we warranty 3 DAYS, in three days if you have any questions, please contact us!!!! We would like to help you out.""

At that point of time, I went to [microsoft.com](https://microsoft.com) and registered my purchase. Needless to say, everything happened without a hitch. I was happy.

This was 52 days ago.

Today, when I opened Microsoft Excel, it says that my product key activation has failed and I have 4 days to enter a valid product key! None of the other Office products work too. Microsoft store doesn't show any purchase (maybe they don't store OEM key purchases).

Ofcourse, [oemkeys.in](https://oemkeys.in) is inaccessible. It is ""under maintenance"".

Regarding the quote above - I presume whatever products they have there were made to work atleast 3 days so that even if the user comes on the 4th day, they can shake off any claim to their ""warranty"".

I think most people here are already careful enough to not fall for any of this but can happen. Attaching my receipt for proof

1549969854.0,1,0,10,"I have recently posted this in r/IndianGaming thought of sharing it here and see whats everyone's opinion. 

Since I got new PC, I got myself in to streaming games and enjoying it a lot. Its been almost 10 months now and i have a small community on YouTube who support me ( by watching stream, donations, memberships etc). Got around 2700 subs in last 10 months (Weekends only stream schedule) without getting raided/hosted by anyone. (except few raids from friends).

Currently, everyone is obsessed with PUBGM and those who play variety of games don't get much exposure because of it. As per my experience this current gen is not even aware about the FC, AC, Metro, Hitman series. Every time I play a new game, they ask me to play PUBGM or ask if this game is available on phone.

Recently, I was doing my musical stream where I play single player game (it was AC:O) and run music in background. Next day, a copyright strike for playing music. I have had this happen so many times &amp; I just mute the audio later in stream. This time it was ban on live streaming for 90 days.

WTF YouTube ? Why can't you be nice like Twitch? They just mute the audio automatically after stream in VOD's. So after thinking a lot and in quest of getting some mature audience, I moved to Twitch and I actually enjoy it without any fear of getting banned. I had to start from zero but I am Ok with it.

Yesterday, few people form this came and spent 2 hours with me on stream and we had a nice discussion going on various topic.

I am on my way to become a Twitch affiliate now. Appreciate if you guys can hangout with me while we play some nice music and games and have a mature discussion on games or just about anything. I am also looking for friends to play co-op games or grind Destiny 2 or anything that's fun.

1553338978.0,1,55,193,"1. Clearly oversold GA tickets,
creating excessive rush and crowds
everywhere


2. Main act djsnake came late and
played only for 30 minutes before
leaving and concert ending which is
disappointing.


3. Acute shortage of water and
beverages by 9pm having tens of
thousands of people having to walk
over 4km with parched throats.


4. Insufficient number of security
personnel to control crowds and fights


5. Weak security checking meaning that
it would have been so easy for any large
scale attacks to take place. 


6. Terrible venue choice with respect to
distance from the city causing heavy
traffic on the 40km stretch it takes
to get there and the isolated region
which meant nothing was nearby and
accessible as we left the venue. 


7. Lack of crowd management and
transportation management meaning
people had to walk over 4 km and be
stuck in that area for over 3 hours in the
middle of the night. 


8. No network which amplifies all the
above problems by tenfold and meant
many people got lost for a long time. 


9. Obvious fire safety hazard to have
such a large crowd assemble in
the clearing of woods with alcohol,
electrical equipment and NO visible fire safety measures to be seen.

One such solution is the international solar alliance, an inspiring partnership between India and France launched in 2015, which aims to empower 121 sunshine-rich countries to harness their most abundant resource. India's leadership in this arena is already improving lives and protecting the health of people across the globe.

I am working on some projects and I really needed a Public IP but their static IP rates are a bit higher than I can currently afford.

Another thread long ago mentioned that ACT was switching over to IPv6 (they had already started here in Bengaluru) but I still don't find it. Do you guys know any other ISP that has already implemented IPv6 (or at least assigns a Public IP)?

Then saw HP ink tank printers . They have good online support and online store (with COD) for original inks. Specs wise they are same as epson ones. 

Price-wise, printer and ink costs are almost same. 3rd party inks are cheap af.

Had some questions - - 

If anyone has ink tank printers, can you recommend one? Also saw reviews about epson acting weird after some months (like resetting problem). Is it true?

Using 3rd party inks is safe? I'm not worried about quality as I will be mostly using it to print texts.

Even if they support Google Authenticator they always have SMS as backup. This puts a lot of responsibility of our online security to our mobile service providers.

Other than safety availability is another issue. If I lose my phone or there is no coverage, I will be locked out of most of my accounts which supports only SMS as 2 factor authentication till I get my phone number back.

On top of it I don't think Airtel, Vodafone are competent enough to not mess up at some point down the line in future and putting many users at risk.

1553243123.0,4,55,63,"I was browsing through amazon and the so called ""best selling AC dual band routers"" are the most ridiculous products ever. Most of the routers below Rs.2000 have 100Mbit LAN ports and if you have a fiber connection that's over 100Mbit/sec, it wont be sufficient and you simply have to buy a new router with gigabit ports. When the main internet connection is capped at 100Mbit/sec by such routers, there is no way your true potential of the wireless upgrade will feel useful. Simply put, what is the use if your wired connection ports are slower than the wireless connection in your router.

Let's say you have an expensive network attached storage(NAS). And you have connected your 4k OLED smart TV to your  new AC750 router. You start streaming from your NAS and alas! it lags like it used to before. Its because your LAN ports are capped at 100Mbit/sec. Meanwhile, if the NAS is connected to the router wirelessly, you will get improved speeds.

Unless you are using WAN and LAN ports at the same time,wirelessly , the extra benefit of the wireless won't even reflect in your day to day usage.

I am surprised this hasn't been widely called out. Everyone talks about how these companies advertise ""theoretical"" speeds where they add up Wireless N + Wireless AC and advertise the sum number but i consider the lack of Gigabit ports as even more stupider. Gigabit is the standard today. Bad products such as these are made to exploit naive consumers and stay away from it.

&amp;#x200B;

Avoid these popular products :

TP-Link Archer C20

NETGEAR R6120 ( Some variants of this does have gigabit)

NETGEAR R6080

D-LINK DIR-816

Zyxel  NBG6503

TP-Link Archer C60

&amp;#x200B;

TP LINK : [https://www.tp-link.com/ae/support/faq/782/](https://www.tp-link.com/ae/support/faq/782/)

TL;dr Buy a Gigabit router, with Gigabit LAN ports if you need WiFi AC dual band routers.

1550788561.0,4,4,3,"Next to Aadhaar, Facebook may be the greatest modern threat against privacy. How do we fight back and keep Facebook from colonising India?

&gt; ""The business model of the internet is surveillance. We build systems that spy on people in exchange for services. [Corporations call it marketing.](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/surveillance_is_the.html)""

Have you noticed? Whenever someone says ""you're being **too political**"", it usually means ""you've mentioned a group of people I don't care about"".

Or **they gaslight you** -- saying you're ""crazy"" for not being white, male, straight, or ""American"" enough. If you dare to notice the discrimination built into their systems, they try to distract from the issue by **attacking you as a person**, trying to force you to jump through endless hoops of arbitrarily defined ""moral purity"".

**This is the typical response on Reddit.** Silicon Valley's social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) was built by them, for them. ""Them"" means entitled middle-class white males. More specifically: _middle-class, white, aged between 18 and 49, male, cisgender, heterosexual, and mostly American_ males. They built social media for themselves and their friends. The rest of us are unwelcome guests in their safe space.

# **Free Speech versus Diversity?**

This is why the rest of us (non-white, women, LGBT, and others) are treated so badly on their systems. They refuse to ban racist, or violent misogyny and homophobia because it would hurt ""free speech"". Their persecution anxiety leads their bigotry behind slogans like ""diversity is the problem"", ""don't shove _your diversity_ in my face"". George Orwell would be proud (or horrified) to see such twisting of words in service of harmfully bad ideas.

&gt; Here's an analogy: nuclear power can be used to power entire cities and give millions of people energy for centuries, or destroy cities and commit genocide in the blink of an eye. Should we allow the secrets and materials for nuclear to proliferate everywhere, because it's ""just science"" and ""knowledge wants to be free""? Of course not.
&gt; 
&gt; Should we allow bigotry and hatred to rule on social media because it's ""just speech"" and ""information wants to be free""? Of course not.

Now you see the bigotry hidden in Silicon Valley talk about ""free speech"". It's free for them, and the costs are left for us to bear. This is the same as patterns of colonisation throughout the history of Western civilisation. History has begun to repeat itself on the internet.

In other words, they have no grasp of basic morality for anyone who isn't like them. And as you'll see here, that means people in India, Brasil and around the world are now starting to die.

---

## **Aadhaar's Failure is Facebook's Success**

The question here begins with privacy.

Aadhaar is well-known for allowing unauthorised access to [private information of millions of India's citizens](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aadhaar-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/story-VhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wO.html). People are concerned, are rightfully so.

In the case of Facebook, selling your privacy to the highest bidder is the entire profit model. That's why Facebook is ""free"". It's as if Aadhaar's privacy-destroying mistakes are Facebook's business plan.

For India, a country where [69% of citizens live in rural areas](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS), this means that over 300 million people (those who have smartphones) are at risk. And unlike the Indian government's dependence on the will of the people, Facebook is completely unaccountable to anyone but their company shareholders.

# **Facebook's Plan to Colonise India**

Starting in 2014, [Facebook tried to give away free Internet to rural India](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-india-doesnt-want-free-basics). The bargain was simple: if you use internet through Facebook, we give it to you for free. That really means, ""if you allow us to watch, record and sell data about every move you make online, we'll give you access to a limited amount of internet for no cost.""

Thankfully, India's regulators eventually said no, and in 2016, the Free Basics program was stopped.

## **Facebook and Bollywood**

If you've watched any Bollywood films over the past few years, there are two names you'll see and hear all the time. You can probably guess. No, it's not SRK or Deepika Padukone. Also not Salman Khan or Katrina Kaif.

The two names are Facebook and WhatsApp.

Again in rural India, WhatsApp has been involved in [an increasing number of murders](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2017/12/deadly-rumours-india-whatsapp-dilemma-171216091928319.html). The culprit is rumours and intentional misinformation that spread via Facebook's messaging service (WhatsApp).

Even though Facebook's attempts to colonise India are blatant (the Free Basics program) and have led to several deaths (WhatsApp), they are still making more efforts.

Instead of regulators, they are trying to convince citizens that Facebook is good by having celebrities constantly use the service in Bollywood films.

You may not have known this, but Instagram and WhatsApp are owned by Facebook. Now think of how many times you've seen films where the real stars in the background are social media accounts on someone's smartphone. (There's even a Reddit community [specifically for Indian people praising Facebook...!](https://np.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/))

# **Democracy, Immigration, Misinformation and Disinformation**

Now think about how easily democracy has been subverted in places like the United States, Britain and Brasil. In the U.S., the Trump campaign openly acknowledged targeting [millions of young women and black voters through Facebook](http://fortune.com/2016/10/30/trump-voter-supression-operations/) to suppress their votes, since they tend to vote Democrat (not Republican; Trump is a Republican). In the case of Brexit, [hundreds of fake Twitter accounts also spread disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/how-400-russia-run-fake-accounts-posted-bogus-brexit-tweets).

As more children and adults in mass detainment centres, the American immigration service (ICE) is [using users' private Facebook data to target and hunt down immigrants](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-facebook-data-track-immigrants).

# **To prevent colonisation of our digital lives, we must fight back for our right to privacy.**

So how can we fight against amoral companies like Facebook (with WhatsApp and Instagram) and Twitter?

We now know that [""free"" access via Internet advertising is just another word for intrusive surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/24/deep-surveillance-is-price-of-a-free-web-advertising). We know that in rural India, where many are less educated, people are dying because of misinformation spread through social media. And we know since 2016, that as long as Facebook and Silicon Valley can get away with it, they don't care.

There needs to be an alternative, and it needs to come from the people who are most affected. Not another Facebook, Orkut, Reddit or Twitter, created by white men, for white men -- and if anyone else wants to join, they'd better not be too ""political"". The web is run by narcissists and bullies now, and there has to be a better way.

I'm working with a project that is creating a new social network, but if this post inspires you to start something for India and the rest of the world, I'd be glad to work with you, too. And if you're just hearing some of these facts for the first time, it's okay to be angry. Get angry enough to do something right now. The stakes are too high now to just shrug, turn away and take another selfie: if we let Silicon Valley take our privacy away, they will never give it back.",t5_2qh1q,"Digital Colonisation: the fight for India's soul, and for the rest of the world, begins with individual privacy online.

1548092995.0,4,8,4,"Looking at the latest news of Whatsapp limiting to 5 forwards, I don't understand how that'll curb fake news at all. 

I think whatsapp needs a corporate sharing capability of some sort. Similar to Snapchat sending messages on holidays and birthdays. That's the only way they can educate their users on 1) how to figure out fake stories vs real news and 2) how to prevent scams. 

Maybe some sort of message reporting feature would be nice. So if a fake forward is going around the country, people can report it as fake and then whatsapp will tag the message as ""might be spam"" or something like that. Or maybe a bot can run to check when a picture or block of text is shared to show when the image was first shared. 

Now of course end-to-end encryption is a hastle in this. So maybe there's an option where you can select a message ""Fact Check"" it. So it'll simply copy-paste the text to google or reverse image search which will most probably open up a news source debunking or proving it.

If you don't know about [Dissent Doe](https://twitter.com/PogoWasRight) you ought to follow her right away. She's 
been [voicing](https://www.databreaches.net/) security, and privacy concerns for a while now. 

Sometime last year, a security researcher contacted her about **Schoolcountry**'s website leaking 
thousands of students' personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, right down to grades.

She wrote to SchoolCountry on August 5, then again on August 10, without any tangible response. 
Or, action. She tried again on December 30, only to get back an autoresponse, and reported the whole
ordeal.[¹][a] 

We had been in touch with her around December, working on another breach[²][b], when she
asked us to help out. So, we did. This is how it went.

# Timelines

Monday, Jan 07, 2019| Kunal Gandhi| Thanks us, and promises to fix it.|    
Sometime between Jan 07-Jan 09, 2019|-| Server is taken down|  
Saturday, Jan 12, 2019| Gunjan Agarwal | Seeing that Google still has **all** the data in its cache, we sent out a message again. |

# Epilogue

Afte the server was taken down, Dissent wrote about it, and raised a few pertinent
questions[³][c]:
 ""But how many IP addresses accessed those files while they were exposed? 
  The data would be valuable for spamming or phishing parents of students or 
  social engineering.""
  
If you are reading this ask SchoolCountry to fix it **NOW**. If you need reasons --
there are **7000** of them.

1. Studying or working? Where( only if you want to) , what field and what do you do at work?
2. Why did you pick mechanical engineering( honest answers please!) and what do you like about your job?
3. What do you think about the state of mechanical engineering education and engineers in India?
4. Coolest project you've worked on or dream about working on...

Making custom PCs for people tailored perfectly towards their requirements. I'd charge a 10-20% (this can be decided later) assembly fee and of course, money that covers the cost of the parts. The issue is, would the cost difference between what I'm charging and what the market price is be reasonably high for people to forgo getting a 5-year guarantee on parts and such and other perks? There's also the issue that I'm a 16-year-old whose only experience is having built two systems - one my own, which is a cheap as hell programming workstation that works great; the other is one I built for my cousin for gaming. I could offer a 1-year guarantee or something and if any of the parts fail, I could just ask Amazon or wherever I got the parts for a replacement.

I'm thinking if all this works out, I could have a standard gaming rig with parts customers could swap if they wanted something different. What do you think?

I'm a final year CSE student from a tier-1 college, and have offer of a good paying job (13lpa base) in a product-based company (US-based), as well as one in a startup with nearly the same salary.

Going through the reviews about people ranting about the monotonous life in software industry and people hitting upper cap by the time they hit their 30s. The only way they break the ceiling is by getting into managerial role, for which many get into MBA, or switch roles.

Also, I have heard/read about most well paying jobs in India being given by American companies, leading to much hierarchies and layers of management suffocating the employees. But yeah, one can definitely get what they want and contribute to the company.

I love developing software products, building stuff, automating and tooling stuff, work on backend and infra, and have interned at some good startups. I love software. Not much interested in higher studies, and I value hands-on experience above academics.

* However, I am a bit concerned if I should really consider being a software developer for long time in companies like Microsoft, Goldman, or good indian startups like Oyo, Ola, Dunzo etc.
* Should I make sure I prepare for CAT to get an MBA and avoid hitting the ceiling early enough?

Pluses

\- Genompatri much cheaper than 23andme Health reports

\- 100+ medications suitability results in Medicamap report

\- genetic counselling provided

\- periodically they have sales

&amp;#x200B;

Minuses

\- all the Reddit and Youtube presence focuses on business rather than health aspect, so it's difficult to find frank assesments by neutral individuals 

\- Unles you're \*in\* India or the region, couriering to/from india could remove the low price advantage

\- a bit pushy sales people

&amp;#x200B;

Neutral

It was after all an ICBM. I even saw its coverage on US tv, and they rarely show anything related to India. But it wasn't a political issue back then. The govt didn't try to claim credit or blame previous govts. Now we are in a situation where every damn thing is made political. The govt has obvious plants (like the former ISRO chairman who is tainted and joined BJP to prevent arrest) who are assigned to blame the previous govt. I mean what if UPA didn't want to test ASAT. There could be any number of reason. Honestly it's not that important from national security POV and we knew that we already had the capability if needed. Testing ICBM Agni 5 was a much bigger deal as for the first time we were able to cover all of China with it. But I can't remember anyone chest thumping over it. I honestly don't know where we are going as a nation. Modi has set a very dangerous precedent here. No previous govt played with national security issues like this. If we're being objective, Pakistan actually came out with an upper hand after Pulwama and the ensuing air battle. We have never lost a perception battle to Pakistan before this. Can you imagine the chest thumping if Modi had executed something like Siachen? I am just sick of all of this. And these are just a few examples, they have been doing this from day 1. 

Rant over. Sorry.

This is a rant, so please bear with me.

Ever since BJP has been elected in 2014, It has been extremely controversial, due to the fact its Hindu nationalism and its controversial leaders, however many still had hopes that BJP would do good, BJP however was not as good as expected, BJP did do some good things like Sanitation, Electrification, etc. But they Started having their Negatives and they had a lot of them but Congress, Not only did they lose the elections, but the also did nothing to rebuild their party and image. Congress has done literally nothing to combat BJP, infact, they are losing badly to BJP in most fronts, Lets look at some of them -

1. Demonetisation, Congress had a wonderful opportunity to destroy BJP in the mind of common people, yet try as they might, BJP Propaganda was able to beat Congress arguments and Congress were able to do nothing.
2. Farmer Suicide, Congress again was able to not convince the majority that BJP is the cause of this and as such was not able to rally support
3. BJP was able to successfully weaken all institutions in our country and place their men in charge, while congress just sat and watched
4. Mishandling of Kashmir done by BJP as Terrorism rose by more than 200% and yet, congress did not even think of using this issue against BJP
5. Asifa Bano Case, A Horrendous where a 8 year old was raped by BJP Officials and what Congress Did, nothing, Hell they even allowed BJP to manipulate the issue into a Hindu vs Muslim issue and they did nothing for it
6. Rafale deal, Congress tried their level best to accuse BJP of Corruption, yet nothing happened, infact they spent way too much time on Rafale Deal that even the Country forgot about them

Congress is dragged down by the Gandhi Family, especially Rahul Gandhi, who really give waste Congress, Ask yourselves this, If Amit Shah was Congress President, he would have a Field Day against BJP in these issues, but these morons successfully turn a favourable situation into a unfavourable one.

Not a pappu anymore, I feel sad for him, like he was forced to perform at something and was looked at with higher expectations. Setting him up for failure. He should have been given or he should have taken a junior ministry >cabinet post before becoming the PM candidate

His guests are well picked and mostly knowledgeable and the analysis is done in Kamra's usual piercing humourous manner. If you want a clearer view of what goes on behind the scenes or rather the hidden hypocrisies of parties and leaders, the show is a must watch. 

Again as is true with everything, there is a certain amount covering up and misguiding done by the participants, but it's mostly unbiased (atleast more than usual). Kamra doesn't spare his guests either as the interviews are interlaced with videos/images/statistics highlighting their hypocrisy at times. 

I'm including the links to some of my favourite episodes. Keep an open mind and it will definitely be a eye opening experience. 

[Ravish Kumar (Journalist) one of the very few ones still having the courage to tackle the government openly. He explains the deteriorated state of the Indian media in the past few years.  ](https://youtu.be/stNh_di8OM8)

[Javed Akhtar (Bollywood veteran) and Yogendra Yadav (Political activist/analyst). They talk about the rise of communalism and hatred contrasting today's state with conditions when they were growing up. Interesting conversation with some good examples. ](https://youtu.be/ZZCr0ypso6Q)

[Shweta Shalini (BJP Spokesperson) and Atishi (AAP).  Kamra questions various moves and policies of their respective parties and highlights the hypocrisy very clearly. This one is also just pure entertainment due to elaborate lies and covering done by the guests. (Mostly Shweta)](https://youtu.be/72kwFyLT8wI)

[Owaisi (AIMIM President). I'm conflicted over this because it does show Owaisi's hitherto hidden side. But you can also see him avoiding tricky questions. Overall good episode to gain extra perspective. ](https://youtu.be/2HMVMivv4A8)",,"[Political] If you want to see content that exposes and explains the political atrocities of the recent past, watch 'Shut up ya Kunal' by Kunal Kamra.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/biugvm/political_if_you_want_to_see_content_that_exposes/

1551323834.0,0,20,81,"With the news of [Amit Shah trying to grab votes on the back of the Balakot Strike](https://thewire.in/politics/amit-shah-uses-indian-airstrikes-to-appeal-to-voters-in-ups-ghazipur), I decided to share the following essay on the current administration's short-sighted machinations.

I don't condemn military action. I feel that any military strike with a clear strategic goal is an essential tool in a Nation's foreign policy toolbox. I am not averse to ""surgical strikes"" or raids provided the goals are clearly outlined and there is net positive outcome. 

I do however take umbrage when the actions of our Armed Forces are traded  in for cheap, short-term political capital. This is what I feel has happened in the last two days. 

The Balakot ""Pre-emptive"" attack is an albatross around Modi's neck. What should've been a low profile, covert operation was paraded in front of the wolfish Indian media. It was a blatant effort to save face, to live up to a manufactured image in the eyes of the Indian public which was enraged - rightly so - at the catastrophic loss of 40 CRPF Jawans in the Pulwama attack. 

In doing so, India lost sight of WHY such strikes are conducted and why they need to be covert actions. 

Pakistan is not a homogeneous whole - a singular entity of evil. It's a nation which is under Military rule at every possible level. The Pakistani military's raison d'etre is Indian aggression - perceived and real both. 

The Pakistani Military and 'Deep State' can only maintain control if there is a credible and immediate threat to Pakistan from India. Through proxy warfare and supporting sub-versive, terrorist elements in J&K they are assured that India reacts predictably to any major attacks - derail peace talks, incite Indian military action and retain a stranglehold through panic and fear-mongering.

The Balakot air-strikes ignored the above and the Indian Civil Leadership in typically short-sighted manner failed to account for the fact that if you challenge the Pakistani Military Leadership or Sovereignty in such a blase manner then there will be fallout which cannot be favourable. 

What bothers me to no end is the absolute lack of strategic vision the current Govt. has showcased by choosing to thump-chests and be overt about their ""strong"" retaliation. 

A covert, plausibly deniable attack on the same target - I have serious doubts that the air strikes cause 300 casualties - would sidestep a direct challenge to the Pakistani Military and Deep State actors. It wouldn't pressurize them to the brink of conducting air-strikes on their own. Things can spiral out of control within hours.

When you deploy Strike Aircraft you have increased the chances of escalation by a considerable amount. If you then brag about it in the news the next day, those chances shoot up to a 100%.

Net outcome - A Mig-21 lost, no confirmed effect on target and an IAF Wing Commander captured by the Pakistani Armed Forces. India and Pakistan reach to new heights of aggression and this further exacerbates our divide.

A covert strike via submarine launched cruise missiles or even an airstrike minus the flag waving and nose-thumbing would've lead to a far more favourable strategic outcome in the long run. But the Armed Forces of both Nations pay a bloody price for political equity.

At the end of the day, the posturing and hate-mongering confuses and obfuscates. It calls for escalation on both sides. More importantly, for India, it drops a smoke screen on the most critical issue:

Jammu and Kashmir

The political leadership should realize that at the end of the day this is an INTERNAL SECURITY problem. Foreign actors are only able to 'act' because the environment is conducive to such activities.

We cannot and should not fail the state and people of J&K. Amidst the war-mongering and cries for revenge it's imperative to realize that we have an insurgency on our hands and this needs CIVIC ACTION to go along with Military raids. 

Until we nip the insurgency in the bud by serious socio-political efforts to improve the quality of life for the average Kashmiri it will be extremely easy for Pakistan or any foreign entity for that matter, to foment terrorist acts. It's not enough to conduct surgical strikes, until We look inwards and start from there, we cannot achieve long lasting stability. It's not going to be easy, counter-insurgency never is - it's messy and drags on...but it can be done.

Senseless Pakistan bashing, War mongering and most importantly...the manipulation of information and military operations for short term, selfish political gain is going to be a bane for the internal security situation of India. 

tl:dr

And it seemed odd that Modi compared terrorism to climate change. My gut says that climate change is a much larger threat than terrorism, but how do the number of people who are affected by both actually compare? If you look at the number of floods, draughts and famines caused by climate change, and see how many people are affected by that and compare that to the number of people affected by terrorist activities, are the two close? Doesn't feel like they would be, but I could be wrong

I am sure everyone of you has felt that, irrespective of your ideology. I have came to a realization that it is important to separate politics of a person from a person.

>	An investigation by Cobrapost has exposed 36 Bollywood celebrities ready to promote a political party for money by posting favourable messages on their social media accounts to help create a favorable environment in the run-up to 2019 elections. Among these celebs are actors, singers, stand-up comedians and dancers: Noted playback singers, Abhijeet Bhattacharya, Kailash Kher, Mika Singh and Baba Sehgal; actors Jackie Shroff, Shakti Kapoor, Vivek Oberoi, Sonu Sood, Amisha Patel, Mahima Chaudhry, Shreyas Talpade, Puneet Issar, Surendra Pal, Pankaj Dheer and his son Nikitin Dheer, Tisca Chopra, Deepshikha Nagpal, Akhilendra Mishra, Rohit Roy, Rahul Bhat, Salim Zaidi, Rakhi Sawant, Aman Verma, Hiten Tejwani and spouse Gauri Pradhan, Evelyn Sharma, Minissha Lamba, Koena Mitra, Poonam Pandey, Sunny Leonne; comedians Raju Srivastava, Sunil Pal, Rajpal Yadav, Upasana Singh, Krushna Abhishek and Vijay Ishwarlal Pawar; and choreographer Ganesh Acharya and dancer Sambhavana Seth. This is almost who’s who of the entertainment industry, both film and TV.

>	While we saw all these celebs succumbing to the lure of money and agreeing to indulge in this unethical and unlawful practice, there were some notable exceptions, though. When we approached Vidya Balan, Arshad Warsi, Raza Murad and Saumya Tandon with our proposition, these celebs chose to go by their conscience and straightaway refused to play ball.",,Cobrapost Sting Reveals Celebs Taking Money To Promote Political Parties,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/as8wwo/cobrapost_sting_reveals_celebs_taking_money_to/

I was reading an [article](https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge/features/elections-2019-the-ordinary-world-of-kanhaiya-kumar-1556255953373.html) about Kanhiya Kumar and this quote above resonated in me alot. I am the same age as Kanhiya working in a Corporate company, and i feel that what Kanhiya has done is to set an example on how to fight the MAN. He was accused, jailed, beaten, harassed, and humiliated. But all he did was keep standing up after being beaten to the ground with false accusation and intimidation. What was happening to Kanhiya is what happens to anyone who questions authority, and when I say authority i mean in bosses, government, police, RWA members, some old guy in your neighborhood. These people abuse their powers and try every trick in the book to attack you. I have faced these type of people myself and I can guarantee you this that if you stand up and fight you will win, but only if you hold that person responsible. 

Kanhiya Kumar is not only a resistance movement symbol but a symbol of how to respond to authorities. I have seen many leaders but this one stands out. Because he stood against such injustice and attack by the current government and started to rally the masses against the injustice of the government. 

 He not only is able to condense the most complex political issue into a beautiful explanation that everyone understands but is also able to connect with the people listening to him. He says the right things at the right time but can't say if he will be able to survive in that cesspool of hyenas in parliament. But, I am excited to see if he is going to make waves in the parliament or not. 

Warning to all, A citizen is not a politician, a politician is never a citizen. Always hold your politicians accountable and answerable. don not in any circumstances become a **political fanboi**.

> At Delhi's Ashoka hotel, the national convenor of the UP-based All India Muslim Majlis, Wasi Ahmad, told the SIT he had been fielding puppet candidates in state elections since 2002.

> Ahmad offered fake nominees for next year's assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.

> His bogus candidates would stand for the Rashtriya Awami Dal, another local group that he claimed to be running separately. The Rashtriya Awami Dal is designated by the election commission as a registered unrecognised party.

> Ahmad then explained privileges puppet candidates like his bring to their sponsors from their entitlements, such as permits for campaign vehicles and additional bank accounts to manipulate spending.

> The election commission has capped expenditure of candidates fighting parliamentary and assembly polls. The limits vary from state to state.

> According to the EC's online handbook for candidates, non-compliance to the ceilings could attract serious action.

> India Today's special team then met Rajesh Bharti,  president of the Swarashtra Jan Party. His group from Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh was registered in 2011.

> Bharti also offered a candidate, whose primary role would be to cut into the votes of his financer's opponents.

> ""This is also a sport for me to help someone (the sponsor) win. His victory will be mine,"" Bharti said.

> His phony candidate would participate in campaign, but with a brief to eat into the support of his sponsor's rivals.

> ""He (the puppet) will use our party flag not yours. He'll have his posters everywhere and will have car passes issued in his name. But when he will move out to campaign, he'll discretely talk to people about you. On the face of it, he'll be representing his own party,"" Bharti said.

> Thereon, India Today's crew visited Shariq Usmani, who is in charge of the Apna Desh Party's western Uttar Pradesh unit.

> Everything and anyone can be bought, he told the undercover team as he quoted a stunningly high price for his fraudulent tactics.

> ""For 20 (dummy) candidates, it will be at least between Rs 10 crore and Rs 12 crore,"" Usmani said.

[In Andhra politics, pastor K A Paul has generated enough confusion to gain some ground](https://indianexpress.com/elections/andhra-pradesh-elections-k-a-paul-praja-shanthi-party-5648582/)

> The PSP could at best be an also-ran in Andhra politics with not much traction on the ground, but it is now garnering attention for some peculiar reasons. Jagan’s YSR Congress Party has complained to the Election Commission **that the party had fielded at least 35 assembly candidates with names similar to their own candidates.** For example. in Ongole constituency, Jagan’s party has Balineni Srinivas Reddy and Paul’s party has Balineni Srinivasa Rao as their candidate.

> If you think this is not confusing enough, Paul’s election symbol, the helicopter with its rotor blades, when seen in a smaller size could be eerily similar to the fan symbol of Jagan’s party. Add to that the fact that colours of the party flag too are similar.

[Kerala politicians use the fine art of putting dummy candidates to split rival votes](https://www.firstpost.com/politics/kerala-assembly-polls-dummy-candidates-votes-election-commission-2764514.html)

> In the Mathura Lok Sabha constituency in 2014, **BJP candidate Hema Malini had to contend with two other Hema Malinis, who contested as Independents.**

> **But K Sudhakaran of the Congress was not as lucky in Kerala. Having won the Kannur seat in 2009, he lost it in 2014 by 6,566 votes, while two of his namesakes — K Sudhakaran Sreesai and K Sudhakaran Kollod —together polled 7,151 votes.**

> Hunting for people with the same or similar names and enticing them with money into contesting as Independents to split a rival’s votes is a dirty, old trick practised across India.

> Take a look at just one district, Kannur in the north of Kerala:

> - In Irikkur, along with Minister KC Joseph of Congress, there is a Joseph (without initials), an Independent.

> - In Kannur constituency, there are three Satheesans: Satheesan M (Congress), Satheesan P and Satheesan EV (Independents).

> - There are three Shajis in Azhikode: KM Shaji (Muslim League), Shaji KM and KM Shaji (Independents).

> - Thalassery has two Abdullakuttys (one of the Congress and one Independent) and two Sajeevans (Sajeevan VK of BJP and Sajeevan VK, Independent).

> - In Kuthuparamba, CPM’s KK Shailaja has to contend with two other ‘Shylajas’, Independents.

> **Of the Kannur district’s 11 assembly seats, seven have dummies.** In varying degrees, the story is the same in all the 14 districts of Kerala.

>  From political greenhorns to seasoned veterans, several candidates are depending on hired detectives for political intelligence ranging from the issues agitating the minds of the electorate to the secret strategies of their rivals and even the local leaders that can be put up as dummy candidates to split the votes and spoil the show for their opponents. 

>  With women detectives, spy cameras, recorders and other tools at their disposal, professional agencies are busy probing for potential marital discord or family dispute and even keeping an eye on the poll managers (something that Aarti Devi, too, would have benefited from). 

>  “Candidates of major political parties in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have approached me to find dummy candidates to field in order to split the vote banks of their opponents,” said Deswal, adding that the dummy candidates are usually local leaders belonging to the minority community.

Netflix recently introduced a show [Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj](https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80239931) which talks about all various issues from Immigration issues to the Deforestation in Brazil but the show is more America centered (the jokes in particular, those who have watched his shows may get what I mean). He even has an episode about [Indian Elections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqZ_SH9N3Xo) . The point i'm trying to make here is that we need shows like these for us Indians where issues can directly be addressed while at the same time comedy and satire can be used. Shows like this will educate us about our current affairs as well as give us a good laugh. If this somehow reaches our famous OTT's like Hotstar or MX Player or even Netflix I hope they create an Indian satire show that would keep us updated of the issues and events around us.

P.S. - Comedy Nights with Kapil and many more are satirical shows but the post is not about that.

Now when this happens, all the candidates participating are from SC/ST for that seat. Hence the SC/ST votes are split. Hence, SC/ST community fails to elect a strong leader to represent them. Instead, this split vote results in victory of a candidate picked by others(Upper Castes). ([This is that reason close to 55% of reserved seats are won by BJP](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/half-of-bjps-additional-mps-from-sc/st-constituencies/articleshow/69501208.cms). Or Congress took advantage earlier). This defeats the whole purpose of reservation as it does not empower the community. If we reserve 33% seats to women, there will be similar scenario where all women are pitted against each other. The weakest one which men choose will be the one representing.
2. Success of TMC and BJD experiment in recent election. [Both parties allocated more then 33% percent seats.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tmc-fields-41-women-bjd-promises-33-will-other-political-parties-take-cue-98300) [Result is that more than 33% percent of candidates elected from these parties are women.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/42-of-bjd-mps-are-women-highest-ever-for-any-party/articleshow/69490501.cms)

&#x200B;

Do you think there would be any drawback by this policy? Doesn't this serve the purpose better?",,We don't need 33% Women's reservation in Loksabha. We need a law that mandates minimum 33% seat allocation by every political party.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bz5q6a/we_dont_need_33_womens_reservation_in_loksabha_we/

Some announcements, anecdotes and his own prompt response on twitter are often given as an evidence. But the reality as often is the case is more nuanced than that. Let's see some news from other side of the aisle: 

> [Rail freight volume tumbles in November
](http://www.livemint.com/Money/vWAdyKIjZiZ0ZwJH9FzPzJ/Rail-freight-volume-tumbles-in-November.html)

> Deceleration in freight volume growth is a continuing saga at the Indian Railways. **Compared with 8.5% growth a year ago, freight volumes fell 4.2% in November this year**. In November 2013, volume grew 3%

> Even passenger volumes have dropped 2.6% 

> Thanks to rate hikes, gross earnings of the Indian Railways till October are 8% higher than the previous year. But they are almost 9% lower than the budget estimates

[Slowing rail freight volume growth points to poor state of economy](http://www.livemint.com/Money/dtcu77hT9hX5n7TgsgUMGL/Slowing-rail-freight-volume-growth-points-to-poor-state-of-e.html)
>
Freight volume growth slows to 2% in June quarter compared with 4% a year ago; In absolute terms, the incremental freight volumes have almost halved

> More than three-fifths of the Railways’ revenues come from freight services. The slowdown is not seen in revenue, thanks to the freight hikes. Goods revenues increased 6.5% in July. In the four months to July, they are up 13.5%. Though revenue growth is encouraging, it is way below the budget estimates. Thankfully, expenses are also rising at a slower-than-estimated pace. But the gap between the budget estimate and the actual amount is not as large as it is in the goods revenues.

> Compared with a year ago, expenditure on construction of new lines and doubling of tracks increased by more than one-third in the first four months of the current fiscal year

[Railway passenger fares may go up
](http://www.thehindu.com/business/railway-passenger-fares-may-go-up/article8082709.ece)

> Passengers may have to pay higher fares following the finance ministry’s recent decision to cut gross budgetary support to railways ministry by Rs.12,000 crore

> For freight, barring coal, the core sector is not so robust with cement, steel and construction sectors performing poorly. We may have to look at the bitter pills of increasing the passenger fares apart from cutting costs.

> Recently, the government had increased Tatkal booking charges by up to 33 per cent for travel in sleeper class, AC-III tier, AC-II tier and executive class.

[Reading between the railway tracks: Turnaround plan and the numbers
](http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/reading-between-the-rly-tracks-turnaround-plan-and-the-numbers/)

> **Most vital signs of a commercial organisation are flashing red.**

> By December-end, the Railways had carried just 8 million tonnes more freight than last year. The Budget idea of carrying 85 million tonnes more by March 31, 2016, again looks difficult to achieve 

>By November, the Railways had spent only 44% of its capital expenditure budget. It has spent only 41% of funds allocated for doubling.

>**Only 28% of the Rs 1,748 crore allocated for works under passenger amenities has been spent so far.**


So we see a picture of Indian railway where it's financial health is in poor state. It is not able to meet the projected revenue and it is not able to get work done as fast as it needs to even when the funds are assured.

M21, Delhi

&#x200B;

I've invented a stationary utility device and now want to turn it in a business. I've applied for design, patent,trademarks as Intellectual properties. I have completed msme and gst registration. i've prepared visiting cards, proprietor stamp, installed billing software and a 100 pgs letterpad. I have a batch of 400 pcs ready to test the market .  I won't disclose it before the launch so please don't ask about it (no offence).

Not bragging just giving the information, I've done everything alone from research to paperwork to purchase raw material to manufacturing( plastic parts come from factory. i have to assemble it and pack in the box) to finance/money stuff (ca does gst returns). It has really taken a toll on me.

&#x200B;

here's my work environment.

i want to operate from home. my parents are agreed to this and i have access to half of first floor. it's a single room where i do the assembly(tightening screws to join parts) and packing and in one corner i have a table where i do rest of company related work from a laptop.

i'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.

&#x200B;

i really don't have budget for renting a shop and hiring employee. i want to execute this testing phase alone. if it'll be successfull then i'll get a shop, employees and other equipments but rightnow i don't want to create too much financial burdon on my parents

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

my queries are

1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.
2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

&#x200B;

3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.

&#x200B;

4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

&#x200B;

5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

&#x200B;

6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\*\*\*\* hain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

anything else you want to advice me you're welcome guys. I'm just a 21 year old trying to escape from the rat race and want to really contribute something to the world.

In the last two years, along with doing my PGDBA in distance mode, i have managed to start my own exports company with my cousin which is doing fairly well. But ever since i was in college I've always felt that i wanted to teach in my free time (EXIM, Marketing Management, Business Management, etc) . I do not want to teach full time. And i am not doing this for money as i am already earning more than enough. Its just a passion i want to pursue. 

I know i require a B.Ed to make this happen but unfortunately i do not have time to pursue this full time and this requires passing entrance tests and attending college. 

I am inclined to pursue an IGNOU Masters of Arts (Education) http://www.ignou.ac.in/ignou/aboutignou/school/soe/programmes/detail/72/2. & then perhaps try for Doctor of Philosophy in Education: http://www.ignou.ac.in/ignou/aboutignou/school/soe/programmes/detail/69/2

2. Are the courses i have rounded out to sufficient or not? 

3. What else can i pursue to make my credentials stronger?

4. Do you know any other courses from other institutes that can make me a suitable teacher/professor?

###Headline Stories

**The Good News: Inflation**

Do you hear that sound? That’s the sound of retail stores in India reducing their prices to a 3 month low. After rising for five straight months, retail inflation in February came down to 5.18%. This has been [attributed](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-14/news/71509641_1_retail-inflation-price-rise-pulses) largely to a fall in the prices of vegetables, pulses and fruits. While cereal prices remained the same, the dark lining is that prices of eggs shot up significantly. Time to substitute omelets with salads, perhaps? But that’s just the retail end of business. Coming to the wholesale side of business, inflation in wholesale prices fell for the 16th straight month and remained [negative](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Decline-in-inflation-on-expected-line-Finanace-ministry/articleshow/51400780.cms) at -0.91%. The data comes from the Consumer and Wholesale Price Indices, which track retail and wholesale prices around the country.


**The Bad News: Foreign Trade**

Not to harsh your mellow, but stop rejoicing over the good news for a second and hear this. India’s February Exports decreased by 5.66%. If you haven’t been following the export numbers, and no one can blame you for that, this is the 15th consecutive month in which exports have [decreased](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/rfZrfTFsUFMVWkTXV8wEAK/Indias-February-trade-deficit-narrows-to-65-billion.html). Petroleum products was the dark swan as exports of gasoline, jet fuel etc. fell by 28%. The golden goose of the bunch was jewellery as exports of shiny rings and necklaces increased by 11%. Just to give you some perspective, our brothers to the north, the Chinese saw their exports fall by 25%. On the flip side, India’s imports also decreased by 5.03%. You win some, you lose some, right? 


**Rajya Sabha Feels Betrayed**

Giving statutory backing to the unique identity number system, the Lok Sabha this week has passed the [Aadhaar Bill](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lok-sabha-passes-aadhaar-bill/article8361467.ece?homepage=true). This newly passed bill is a significant instrument for the government’s Direct Transfer Benefits scheme for better targeting of subsidies. The argument against it was that it violated the Supreme Court order that said an Aadhaar Card cannot be mandatory but only voluntary. Now, if you remember your 7th standard civics syllabus, both houses of the parliament, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, have to pass a bill for it to become a law. What your 7th standard civics textbook probably didn’t mention is the Rajya Sabha has no say in the matter if a specific bill is categorized as a “money bill”. Which is exactly what Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who piloted the Aadhaar bill through parliament, did so that it can bypass the Rajya Sabha where Jaitley’s BJP does not have a majority. One can only imagine how emotionally hurt the Rajya Sabha was when the Lok Sabha went behind its back to pass the Aadhaar Bill. 

**It’s Raining Black Gold: Sweet, Sweet Oil**

“Tass-Yurikah” sounds like an Urdu swear word, but it’s actually the name of a Russian oil field. Soon enough, it won’t even be entirely Russian anymore. A group of Indian oil companies signed a deal with Rosneft, the Russian oil company that owns [Tass-Yurikah](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ongc-videsh-ltd-ioc-consortium-to-buy-russian-oil-fields-for-4-2-billion/articleshow/51427860.cms), to buy a 29.9% stake in the oilfield for $1.28 billion (₹8,505 crore). This puts the Indians in partnership with the British oil major BP who owns 20% while the remaining 50.1% is still owned by Rosneft. Deals to explore a possible stake sale in Vankor, another Russian oilfield, were also signed. This comes at a time when global oil prices are falling off a cliff, just like BJP’s poll numbers in that [recent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_Legislative_Assembly_election,_2015) Bihar election. This also comes at a time when Russia’s economy is suffering from an acute case of international sanctions that were imposed on Russia after they snatched Crimea from Ukraine, just like the JD(U) snatched seats from BJP in that recent Bihar election. Too political? Thought so. Meanwhile, they just [hiked](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/economy/article-petrol-price-hiked-by-rs-3-07-litre-diesel-by-rs-1-90-litre-1287407) petrol and diesel prices by 3.07/litre and 1.07/litre.

**Ban on 344 Illegal Drugs**

The government is playing the game that everyone knows it excels at - banning things. This time around, the health ministry has issued a ban on over [344 drugs](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/health-ministry-bans-344-fixed-dose-combination-drugs-1286977). No, not the one’s that make you hallucinate or see sounds and hear colours, but the one’s that are pharmaceutical. Known as “combination drugs”, these drugs combine two or more drugs together so the patient only has to pop one pill instead of three. Technically, they were being sold illegally since none of them had approval from the central government, but had entered markets nevertheless after receiving blessings from only the state governments. At least this time around, the bans make more sense. Cough syrup Corex and the famous Vicks Action 500 were among the 344 substances banned. However, the Delhi High Court reversed the ban on [Corex](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/corporates/article-corex-popular-cough-syrup-not-banned-for-now-says-court-1287076?ndtv_related) and is set to hear the case on March 21st after Pfizer ([PFIZER](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3APFIZER&ei=uk_vVqjdIoSVjAGihJ_IBw)), the company that makes Corex, sent lawyers marching down to the Court right away. Feeling a bit jealous of Pfizer, 21 other pharmaceutical companies, including P&G India ([PGHH](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3APGHH&ei=tk_vVsGTOJPwjAGTuZQg)), the maker of [Vicks](http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/hc-relief-for-14-more-drug-firms/210246.html), also managed to convince the court to reverse bans placed on their drugs as well.

**Make Room for One More Tax**

You know how countries sometimes impose tariffs on foreign goods to make domestic players competitive? Well, states across India such as Uttarakhand, Bihar and Assam seem to have forgotten that they are not independent countries but merely states within one. It’s okay, we all go through an identity crisis at some point. Lawmakers in those states have imposed an “[entry tax](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-15/news/71543125_1_entry-tax-goods-services-tax-levy)” on e-commerce websites for selling products that were not made in those states - which sounds eerily similar to tariffs imposed by sovereign nations. What could make this worse? Almost half a dozen other states are also considering imposing a similar tax on e-commerce goods sold inside the state that were manufactured outside the state. If this goes through, you might have to foot the bill for your state’s poor manufacturing as online retailers pass these taxes on to the customer. Also, the grapevine has it that Amazon offered to acquire Flipkart for [$8 billion](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Flipkart-and-Amazon-may-have-explored-sale-talks-say-sources/articleshow/51421374.cms) (₹53,160 crore) last year, but the deal fell through. Make of that what you will.

In 2003,  Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, was taken to task by the Confederation of Indian Industry for the anti-Muslim riots in the state. Leading the charge were prominent industrialists like Rahul Bajaj and Jamshyd Godrej. The CII's attack on Modi provoked an angry reaction by a group of Gujarati industrialists, who organised themselves under the Resurgent Gujarat Group. Adani and Mehta were the leading lights of the RGG, which took on the CII on Modi's behalf. The CII was forced to apologise to the chief minister.

His wealth has more than quadrupled since Modi announced his candidacy in September 2013, the biggest gain among the country’s elite. He travelled with Modi to US, Australia, Bhutan, Brazil, Japan, France and China. After most of Modi’s foreign visits, Adani bagged business agreement from these countries.

The rates at which the Adani Group bagged land from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government for its port and special economic zone (SEZ) project — between Re 1 and Rs 32 per square metre — were much lower than other companies that set up units in the state.  Tata Motors was given 1,110 acres for its Nano car plant in Sanand (near Ahmedabad) at Rs 900 per sq mt, Ford India paid at Rs 1,100 per sq mt for 460 acres close by, while India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, bought about 700 acres in Hansalpur at Rs 670 per sq mt. Among other industrial groups, K Raheja Corp was sold land at Rs 470 per sq mt, while TCS had to pay at Rs 1,100 per sq mt and Torrent Power at Rs 6,000 per sq mt.

Special Economic Zones Rules, 2016, were amended by the department of commerce, to insert a provision on claims for refund under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005. The SEZ Act under which the SEZ Rules are framed did not initially provide any provision for refunds of any kind before this amendment was introduced. The Adani Power Ltd. has claimed that it has paid customs duty on raw ¬materials and consumables – that is, coal imported for the generation of electricity. However, documents leaked to the EPW clearly indicate that the APL had not, in fact, paid the duty on raw materials and consumables amounting to approximately Rs 1,000 crore that had fallen due at the end of March 2015. It appears at face value that by amending the SEZ Rules to insert a provision for companies to claim refunds on customs duty, the department of commerce is ¬allowing the Adani Power Ltd. to claim refunds on the duty that has never been paid by it in the first place [Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/149156/modi-government-adani-group/)

Ironically, the biggest black money case that has come up before the SIT so far is that of the Adani group. The Adani group allegedly took out over Rs 5,000 crore to tax havens, using inflated bills for the import of power equipment from South Korea and China, the SIT on black money was told by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The Adani group vehemently denies any wrongdoing. Modi, after his rhetoric-filled ride to power, has been silent. Since Modi’s ascension to office, what has happened in the ED, which had registered a preliminary case against Adani in Ahmedabad and was handed details of DRI findings, is illustrative. The officer heading the Ahmedabad branch of the directorate was raided by the CBI, which accused him of possessing disproportionate assets. It failed to prove anything at all, despite months of investigation. The two senior-most officers in the Mumbai regional office, who oversaw the investigations in Ahmedabad, were forced out of the agency. The tenure of Rajan S. Katoch, who was heading the directorate when the case was opened, also ended abruptly. Apart from the Adani case, the Ahmedabad ED investigators were also pursuing some of the biggest money launderers of Gujarat.[Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/58640/black-money-investigation-a-feast-of-vultures/)",,Modi and Adani Relation | Lobbying and Crony Capitalism |,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6omzm2/modi_and_adani_relation_lobbying_and_crony/

Elder brother is 33 and college-dropout, has 3 children and has been failing in both business and politics with constant record since past 14 years. He has started over 10 businesses over period of time, all after convincing/pressurizing my father to invest into it and he keeps failing. His failed business ventures have costed family at least 5 Cr loss over period of time. Dad pays for his daily expenses, including his 3 children and wife. Now you may think of kicking out such people out of house if you are young, but you have to understand it's no more practical. He has 3 little kids, and a wife who though supports him but inside regrets marrying this loser but can't even complain since this was their ahaa love-marriage. 

Now I do my little shit and keep my finances separate from them. But that does not help. Elder brother keeps taking money from me ( he's around 10 years elder). And in most cases I'm unable to refuse because I'm still not comfortable telling no to people ( you can call me yes-man), and if I don't give him, and expenses have to be met, so he'll only go to dad's business and take money. So this way sort of I help dad share the burden.

But now I've even started hating dad. He said I should take a FD in his bank because it offers better interest ( it didn't) but then he convinced me, it will help him show good will there and what not and his credit limited would be extended etc etc. Then yesterday was FD maturity day and I'm simply told my money was taken for some equipment at his business. NO FUCKING EXPLANATION and its told like I shouldn't mind it. I didn't react because I know I'm never seeing that money again. If I talk loud, I'll see a sad face as to how he is old and how he supports my elder brother's family etc etc.

1481939163.0,6,5,13,"WARNING! THIS IS DRUNK RANTING. READ AT YOUR OWN PERIL.

It was a cold fucking day. I had to do something I had been putting off for quite some time -- get my bike serviced. I called up the closest service centers to ask if they accept payment by card and I learnt that the nearest service centre that accepts cards was 18 kilometres away. I had to do this nevertheless. As I had said, I had been putting this off forever and I cannot ride her without the service she needs.

So, rode her to that far off service centre and I reached by 13:00. The dude outside noted her number, made a job sheet, and handed out the customer copy to me. He told me that there's a mall nearbly in case I wanted to watch a movie, or I could just wait in the customer lounge. I decided to wait. There was a stupid Govinda movie on the TV -- he was double acting as a cop and his goofy twin. I sat through it. Boredom makes you appreciate the stupidest things. By the time the movie got over, I had checked to see if they had taken my bike in. They hadn't. I was getting impatient. I was getting hungry. I decided to look around for food. I found a place that sold Punjabi sandwiches, whatever the hell those were. I thought I'd pass. I walked further and I found a place cheap and crowded. It was *parathe zabardast parathe*. Crowded is nice. Crowded means you won't have diarrhoea the next morning. So, I walked in and I had a double egg paratha. I was filling as fuck and I paid him with the last 20 rupee note that I had on me.

I walked back to the service centre. They hadn't taken my bike in. That was disheartening. I decided to go and sit in the customer lounge. The aroma of the paratha that my nose had gotten used to made me realise how stinky this ""lounge"" was. It smelt of old unwashed clothes, dandruff, and grease. Anyway, I was sleepy and I dozed off.
I woke up an hour later. My bike hadn't been taken in. I talked to the manager. He said something about a queue. I grumbled and I went back to the customer lounge. I listened to music on my phone for an hour and it was 17:00. Two hours to close shop. A skinny dude finally takes my bike in. I was relieved.

The mechanic asked me if there are any problems. I told him what I had to say. He asked me where I was coming from. I told him.

""Bro, that's far away. Don't you know we have a service centre there?"" he asked.

""Yeah, but they don't accept payment by cards,"" I said.

""Oh, right.""

One of his colleagues walked by.

""Dude, the finance guy called,"" the colleague said. ""We have to wait for November's salary until January, or we have to accept in old notes.""

""I'm not taking old notes *bhencod*,"" he said. ""What if I fail to deposit into my bank account?""

""You've got a point. Yeah,"" said the colleague and he walked away.

""Your bike's sorted,"" the mechanic said. ""They'll clean it. You can make your payment by then.""

I proceeded towards the floor manager and I got my job card. I walked towards the billing counter.

That's when I saw it --  a helpdesk, a distraught girl behind it, and two cops in front of it.

""We hear that this place is accepting and transacting in old notes,"" the fat cop said.

""No, sir. The only old notes we have are from before 9 November 2016,"" the girl said.

""But, we got a call from here saying that your salaries are being disbursed in old notes. DON'T YOU DARE BULLSHIT ME!"" the fat cop bellowed.

The girl, evidently nervous, said, ""Sir, I don't know what you're talking about. We don't accept old notes anymore.""

""Who's phone number is this? We got the call from this number,"" he asked her showing an incoming call on his phone.

""Sir, this number is a common office contact,"" she said, ""Everybody uses it.""

""Okay, so that's how you're gonna play it. I want to see your cashier in two minutes,"" he said.

The cashier was behind his counter and I was having my billing done. I told him that I wanted to pay using my card.

""We're not accepting cards,"" the cashier said.

""Well, I don't have any cash. All I have is my cards,"" I told him.

""Give me five minutes,"" he told me. It looked like he was shitting his pants after the cop asked for the cashier. The cop was then standing beside me and staring intently into the cashier's face.

""Go on. Swipe his card,"" the cop said, ""I can wait for a couple of  minutes.""
 
The swiping machine was in the floor manager's room and the cashier took me along. After the swiping business was done, he said, ""Bro, I can't go back to my cabin and get your invoice. The cops are right there. I'll tell the floor manager to release your bike.""

""Cool, whatever,"" I said.

He talked to the floor manager about my bike. ""The cleaning isn't done yet,"" the floor manager said,""It's gonna take some time.""

I loitered around the shop floor and the customer lounge for some more time and my bike was finally clean. The cashier walked in and handed me my invoice.

""I had to get in there for other customers anyway. Thought I'd give you your invoice,"" he said.

""What happens now?"" I asked him out of curiosity.

""I don't know, bro. *Bhenchod*, these cops probably didn't even get a call from here. Maybe they just want a bribe. One shop a day for them I guess. That girl in reception in new. It's sad that she has to go through this,"" he said. ""Gotta go, man. They are quizzing our GM now, but I have to be there in case they need paperwork.""

""Thank you. Goodbye,"" I said.

""Goodbye,"" I said to the floor manager.

""We're used to shit like this,"" the floor manager said,"" Running a business isn't exactly easy in this shitty city. Goodbye and good night.""

And I came home on my serviced bike, under-dressed for the winter night, shivering in the cold, my hands cold as fuck, thinking of that poor receptionist and the cashier.

tl;dr Went to a service centre to get my bike serviced. Cops hassle them saying that they're transacting in old notes. They say that they're used to this kind of hassling by the cops.

p.s. I'm down quite a bit of Old Monk as I type this.

p.p.s. This shit ain't political. I just wanted to share something I've seen. I just wanted to share how big changes are a pain in the ass for businesses as well.

1517518480.0,6,0,2,"The Narendra Modi government is looking to oust cryptocurrencies from India but has a lot of affection for blockchain. Keeping that in mind no wonder in future Blockchain technology will replace all mediatory authorities from financial transaction & Indians will start to [learn fundamental knowledge of Blockchain technology](https://www.eduonix.com/blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ethereum-essentials)

The distributed ledger technology is becoming a hot favorite in Asia’s third-largest economy for solidifying information, alerting all stakeholders, and preventing tampering. So much so that, in his budget speech on Feb. 01, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced plans to adopt blockchain technology.

> “The government will explore the use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in the digital economy,” 

Jaitley said.

Most commonly known as the technology underpinning the likes of bitcoin and Ether (of Ethereum-fame), blockchain is a digitized and decentralized public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Stripping away the financial application, blockchain is essentially a bookkeeping platform that can be accessed by anybody on the internet but is owned by nobody.

> “Once you have a blockchain, the big spreadsheet in the cloud serves as a record-keeping system that can’t be forged and can’t be reversed,” 

said Nicolas Cary, the co-founder, and president of [Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/) (the company, not the technology).

**Eager governments**

Blockchain technology is already making waves in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

The government there is working with Swedish startup ChromaWay to set up a blockchain-based land registry system that allows people to collateralize property, get loans, and invest against that asset. Tracking property ownership using blockchain allows people to circumvent disputes, frauds, and errors, while also lessening the administrative hassle of registrations and title transfers.

Beyond land registries, blockchain can also put an end to other fraud like identity theft. To reduce the chances of getting hacked, a growing concern in India, the web-based platform can manage digital IDs. 

>“Currently, if you sign up or pay for something on the internet, you turn over unencrypted personal info that gets stored all over internet…creating a honeypot that attracts attackers to breach that service,” 

Cary said. 

With blockchain, only encrypted, relevant information will be released whenever necessary.

Recently, the Maharashtra government called upon industry leaders, researchers, and others to devise ways of incorporating blockchain in e-governance operations. 

> “The government is one of the biggest data creators and data consumers. Blockchain will bring in more efficiency, transparency, accountability, and accessibility in data flows,” 

the state’s chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, said at the Maharashtra Technology Summit (MTech) on Jan. 17.

Amid all the talks of curbing cryptocurrencies, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, still believes that blockchain technology is ripe for adoption. Banks in India are already relying on blockchain to enable overseas transactions, international remittances, and other processes.

The spread of blockchain use in the private sector use of in industries like insurance, healthcare, manufacturing, among others, could also lessen significant burdens that befall the government.

> “Capitalising on the blockchain technology could open new ways of securing peer-to-peer lending transactions, boosting trade finance, fintech and information repository sectors,”

aid Sapan Gupta, the national practice head of banking and finance at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.

> “By segregating the use of blockchain from crypto-currencies reflects the government’s intention to use the technology in a gradual and safer manner before it gets into concepts like replacing currencies.”

**Positive side-effects**

Using blockchain to monitor supply chains means the journey of a good can be tracked from sourcing to their sale by collecting information in the secured cloud-based ledger.

For instance, in the food and retail industry, shipments can be tracked and digitally recorded via a blockchain in real time.

> “This can save lives in the event of an outbreak of food-borne illness,” 

Daniele Bianchi, an assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School, said. 

> “This is obviously helpful both for consumers and the government. Especially in emerging economies whereby the supply chain is typically not easy to track.”

Just like identity theft becomes harder, meddling with critical digital assets—like patient consent records in the healthcare sector or insurance payouts—also becomes less of a concern since no single authority can modify the records. At Bajaj Finserv, the holding company of Bajaj Group’s non-banking financial company (NBFC) and insurance firms, blockchain technology is being used to simplify travel insurance claims. If a flight is delayed, that information comes to the system and the claim amount is automatically generated and paid without the customer having to even file a claim.

There are currently over 40 Indian startups working on blockchain technologies in various industries like finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and logistics, according to Sangeeta Devni, a programme manager at the IT industry trade body NASSCOM’s 10,000 startups initiative. But real-world applications are still few.

**Still learning**

After interviewing early adopters, both on the customer side and vendor side, consultancy firm Deloitte recognised a slew of deterrents to using blockchain technology (pdf) that exist in the Indian market. From a lack of awareness to a dearth of trustworthy vendor partners to cybersecurity concerns, various challenges persist.

> “The main danger comes from hacking, that is, the innovation of the blockchain brings new type of attacks which are far less understood and much less mitigated as those occurring in conventional database management architectures,” 

Bianchi warned.

My close friend is a cancer survivor.

He is 36 years old. 

He has these two career options in mind -

(1) Whether he should get back into IT industry as he has 4.5 year's of coding experience in C#. If yes, what steps.

and

(2) Whether to pursue law as his MBA Finance has given him good exposure to Mergers And Acquisitions (M&A),  Business laws and Taxation.

I am asking your help/advice/suggestion for Query No (2) i.e, He wants to study law at the age of 36 years.

He is appearing for these law exams in 2018 -

CLAT, IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam and DU LLB exam.

He says that there is no age limit for studying law and practicing law. 

Is there any merit to it ? (I don't know anything about careers after law education.)

His family supports him wholeheartedly, but they need clarity on how exactly can pursuing LLB law education help my friend at the age of 36.

Please, Please upvote for visibility.

Edit:

Being a cancer survivor, my friend was unemployed close to 3-4 years during his cancer treatment.

Recently, he secured a part time decent teaching job that can become full time.

Data clearly shows that inflation slowed down due to slowing production. Therefore any pickup in consumption (demand) in short term would lead to inflation. In fact the governor said the same thing that he is wary in the short term of inflation picking up.

Also most us believed that crude was oversold and the governor was too bearish in factoring in crude prices vis a vie future inflation.

1446062736.0,6,1,3,"Those of us who have lived through the earlier days of free India, when the entire nation as looking forward with zeal and fervour and with a sense of national pride, cannot but look upon the present times with deep anguish and distress. I do not think India in its entire history of 5,000 years has ever reached a lower level of degradation than it has reached now. The depth of decadence to which we have sunk was exemplified by the leakage of question papers for the Joint Entrance Examination 1997 for the first time in the history of the Indian Institute of Technology.
The only achievement of Indian democracy has been that it has survived unfractured for fifty years. Nine hundred fifty million people — more than the combined population of Africa and South America — live together as one political entity under conditions of freedom. Never before in history, and nowhere else in the world today, has one-sixth of the human race existed as a single free nation. Professor Rostow of Texas University regards the survival of Indian democracy as the most important phenomenon of the post-war era.

The achievement is all the more creditable, since no other democracy has had such diversity in unity, or was such a mosaic of humanity. All the great religions in the world have flourished in India. We have 15 major languages written in different alphabets and derived from different roots; and, for good measure, our people — whom you can never call taciturn — express themselves in 250 dialects.
The English language, which is not included in the 15 major languages listed in the Constitution, yet continues to be the only link language for the whole country; it is the only tongue in which the South is prepared to communicate with the North.
In 1950, we started as a Republic with inestimable advantages.
First, we had 5,000 years of civilisation behind us — a civilisation which had reached ‘the summit of human thought’ in the word of Ralph Waldo Emerson. We inherited great skills and many-splendoured intelligence, since the genes had evolved over five luminous millenia. We had a superb entrepreneurial spirit, honed over a century of obstacles. A few years ago, a World Bank report on India mentioned two very favourable factors — an unlimited reservoir of skilled labour, and abundance of capital available for investment in new projects. The trader’s instinct is innate in Indian genes. An Indian can buy from a Jew and sell to a Scot, and yet make a profit!

Secondly, whereas before 1858 India was never a united political entity, in that year the accident of British rule welded us into one country, one nation; and when Independence came, we had been in unified nationality for almost a century under one head of state.

Thirdly, our founding fathers, after two long years of laborious and painful toil, gave us a Constitution which a former Chief Justice of India rightly described as “sublime”.
The substance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations on December 10, 1948, is embodied as Fundamental Rights in our Constitution. The right to equality before the law is guaranteed to citizens and non-citizen alike. All religions are treated with equal tolerance and equal reverence. The religion of a citizen is no bar to his holding any office, however exalted, in politics or the judiciary. In this respect, we are more secular than the United Kingdom where a Roman Catholic cannot be the monarch or the lord chancellor.
In another respect, our Constitution may claim to be more progressive than that of the United States of America. Equality of the sexes is a guaranteed right in India, whereas the attempt to incorporate a similar right in the United States Constitution was met with resistance.

We can proudly say that our Constitution gave us a flying start and equipped us adequately to meet the challenges of the future. Unfortunately, over the years we dissipated every advantage we started with, like a compulsive gambler bent upon squandering an invaluable legacy. I am afraid, India today is only a caricature of the noble democracy which our forefathers strove to bring to life and freedom in 1947.

As early as January 1987, The Economist rightly remarked that socialism as practised in India has been a fraud. Our brand of socialism did not result in transfer of wealth from the rich to the poor but only from the honest rich to the dishonest rich.
We built up state-owned enterprises called the public sector in India. The sleeping sickness of socialism is now universally acknowledged, — but not officially in India. More than 240 public sector enterprises are run by the Union government, and more than 700 by the state governments. These public sector enterprises are the black holes, the money guzzlers, and they have been extracting an exorbitant price for India’s doctrinaire socialism.

There is a tidal wave of privatisation sweeping across the world from Bangladesh to Brazil, but it has turned aside in its course and passed India by.

The most persistent tendency in India has been to have too much government and too little administration; too many laws and too little justice; too many public servants and too little public service; too many controls and too little welfare.
My own thinking is that our greatest initial mistake was to start with adult franchise. No democracy has ever paid, all things considered, a heavier price for adult franchise than India. I am not aware of any great democracy which started as a republic on the basis of adult franchise: all of them started with a more restricted system and then graduated to adult franchise. When the Constituent Assembly was in session, two of our greatest statesmen — C Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel — recommended that we should not start with adult franchise but educate our people first to make them worthy of discharging their duties as citizens of a great democracy; but they were out-voted.

The second fatal mistake was to let the population nearly treble, in the absence of any sensible or sound family planning measures and policies. Today, the unbridled population growth, except in the state of Kerala, has been the ruin of this country.
Our third disastrous mistake was to pay no attention to education. Value-based education has never any sex appeal in Indian politics. Unlike Lee Kuan Yew who gave education the priority of priorities in Singapore, our political parties treated literacy as a matter of no consequence. The result has been that more than half of our population is literally illiterate. Official statistics give a more comforting figure; but that is only because any person who can write or sign his name is considered to be literate according to official statistics.

Professor Amartya Sen has bluntly said India will be the only country in the world to enter the 21st century with half her population illiterate, and that successive state governments have demonstrated “incredible irresponsibility” with regard to primary education. In total disregard of Article 45 of the Constitution, state governments have completely ignored their obligation to provide compulsory primary education.

When I was in the United States, I was often asked one question — How does India, with its great human potential and natural resources, manage to remain poor? The correct answer is very unflattering and hardly the type of answer which an ambassador of any country may be expected to give: We are not poor by nature but poor by policy. You would not be far wrong if you called India the world’s leading expert in the art of perpetuating poverty.

Yes, the potential of India is so great! Sir William Ryrie, the executive vice -president of the International Finance Corporation, expressed the view that India has some of “the most creative entrepreneurs . . . The most dynamic business leaders, and the sharpest financial brains in the world.” These words give you an idea of the magnitude of the effort needed to keep India impoverished.

Most of our politicians and bureaucrats, untainted by knowledge of development in the outside world, have no desire to search for genes of ideas which deserve to be called “a high-yielding variety of economics”. We are smugly reconciled to low yield from high ideals.

India is rattling — and rattling violently with spare human capacity. More than thirty million are registered on our 891 employment exchanges. According to objective estimates, there must be at least thirty million more who are unemployed, but who are not registered.

As the chancellor of the exchequer pointed out in the House of Commons some time ago, the population of Hong Kong is less than one per cent of India’s (0.7 per cent to be precise) and its land area is 0.03 per cent of India’s and yet it has twice the trade of India.

The picture that emerges is that of a great nation in a state of moral decay, of which corruption and indiscipline are two of the several facets. In the land of Mahatma Gandhi, violence is on the throne today. Mobocracy has too often displaced democracy. The contribution of modern India to sociology has been a Bandh — the closure of an entire city by militant rowdies.

One may apply to India the words used by the late Benigno Aquino about the Philippines — “Here is a land in which a few are spectacularly rich while the masses remain abjectly poor, where freedom and its blessings are a reality for a minority and an illusion for the many, a land consecrated to democracy but is a land of privilege and rank, a republic educated to equality but mired in an archaic system of caste.”

The greatest problem of India is that its finest men — men of calibre and vision, knowledge and character — are not in politics and stand little chance of getting elected, having regard to the murky atmosphere of our political life. I was one of the foolish people who told Hari Nanda to stand for Parliament. He stood for Parliament from the seat which was supposed to be the safest for him — Faridabad. He was not only defeated, but he forfeited his deposit!

If I am asked to name one curse which deserves to be regarded as the greatest curse of India, I would say it is casteism.

Unfortunately, divisiveness has become the Indian disease. Truly, divisiveness is the AIDS of India — a disease which is spreading fast and wide, preys on the public mind and is without a cure in sight. Communal hatred, linguistic fanaticism, regional fealty, and caste loyalty are gnawing at the vitals of the unity and integrity of the country. To the growing army of terrorists and professional hooligans, caste or clan, creed or tongue, is a sufficient ground to kill their fellow citizens.

National integration is born in the hearts of the citizens. When it dies there, no army, no government can save it. Inter-faith harmony and consciousness of the essential unity of all religions is the very heart of our national integration.

The soul of India aspires to integration and assimilation. Down the ages, Indian culture — a tremendous force of power and beauty — has been made richer and deeper as a result of absorbing what is best in outside influences and integrating those various influences to grace and enrich its own identity.
Yet, an objective overview would justify confidence in the long-term future of the country. A nation’s worth is not measured by its gross national product any more than an individual’s worth is measured by his bank account. Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith remarked that while he had seen poverty in many countries of the world, he found one unusual attribute among the poor of India — “There is richness is their poverty.”

Hundreds of millions, who have no standard of living, still have a standard of life. The ancient civilisation has survived and will survive when the raucous and fractious voices of today are lost in the silence of the centuries.

Nature has been kind to India in one respect. It has endowed the country with the gift of producing great leaders in the darkest hour — leaders with the gift of grace who can arouse the trusting millions to lofty heights.

I believe the solution for India is not to be found in adult franchise. There is a basic lesson of Indian history. Our people have always taken their moral standards from their rulers; the people have risen to great heights when they have basked in the glow of noble kings or leaders. The present generation is waiting for a leader who will make it relearn the moral values, and who will inculcate in the people as Gandhiji did, a sense of the responsibilities which fall on every citizen of a free society.
It is true that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. But it is true, in even a deeper sense, that eternal responsibility is also part of the price of liberty. Excessive authority, without liberty, is intolerable; but excessive liberty, without authority and without responsibility, soon becomes equally intolerable.

De Tocqueville made the profound observation that liberty cannot stand alone but must be paired with a companion virtue: liberty and morality; liberty and law; liberty and justice; liberty and the common good; liberty and civic responsibility.
One last thought, and I shall have done. Today, the unity and integrity of India seems to be at stake. But “even this shall pass away”. Indian society will, in course of time, acquire the requisite political culture — the attitudes and habits of tolerance, mutual respect and goodwill, which alone can make democracy workable.
The day will come when the 26 states of India will realise that in a profound sense they are culturally akin, ethnically identical, linguistically knit and historically related.

The major task before India today is to acquire a keener sense of national identity, to gain the wisdom to cherish its priceless heritage, and to create a cohesive society with the cement of Indian culture. We shall then celebrate our Republic as the dependence of the states upon one another, the dependence of our numerous communities upon one another, the dependence of the many castes and clans upon one another — in the sure knowledge that we are one nation.

I am considering an option and would like an opinion on this matter. I was thinking that while I learn my family business under someone else’s guidance, I also prepare myself for CFA. Since I am already a Finance undergrad, I will be furthering my studies in my field of interest. This would mean I can learn about how to handle a business and earn a CFA (provided I pass). But this would also mean boycotting the MBA.

Also, maybe pursue a Gemological Institute of America (GIA) course at some point – although unlikely.

I thought it would be an interesting exercise to seek your views about the Demands for Grants for ministries this year. These documents show how much money is being proposed to be allotted for every ministry. *The increase/decrease in the grants indicates the focus areas of this Government.*

[Here is a summary of all demands](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dgsum.pdf). It will help you quickly glance through the major figures.

[Another detailed summary which will help you see each demand for departments under the ministries](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/alldg.pdf)

[Ministry-wise detailed demands can be found here](http://indiabudget.nic.in/dg.asp?pageid=1)

Example of how we can go about discussing this: I found something interesting [here](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dg30.pdf) with regards to Drinking water and sanitation. The budget for the previous year Rs 12,217 cr, it has been slashed to Rs 6,243 cr.  That's a 48% reduction. I am trying to figure out why is there such a big drop and how it will affect the overall scene of national water resources. 

I must tell you that I am no expert in finance. So perhaps some of you who do work in the area can help me waddle through this massive budget? And in the process, find out what is happening to the ministries that interest you.

If you put up some interesting suggestions, I will include your inputs in the brief I am preparing for MP /u/tathagatasatpathy. 

Session resumes tomorrow and you can follow the budget discussion as it happens. I will alert /r/india regarding that everyday by putting up the [List of Business](http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Business/listOfBusinessCurrent.aspx) for the next day, so that this can become a daily input seeking session.

1. Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. To claim that Kerala is high on HDI purely from post-independence governments is a bit of a stretch; they started out with a relatively compact population (13.5m in 1951) and the most advantages among states, thanks to the focus on education by the local dynastic precursors, the Travancore Family, along with contributions with subgroups like the Nair Society and Christian Missionaries. 





3. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foeign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.

[Source](https://medium.com/@thousifmohammed/why-kerala-rank-last-in-ease-of-doing-business-7da7ed96d113) 


5. Consequently, abysmal FDI inflows, at just over US$1.2billion in 2000-15 (the last 15 years), just 0.5% of total inflows. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka received over US$17billion and US$16billion respectively in the same period. [Source](http://indien.ahk.de/fileadmin/ahk_indien/Bilder/2015_News_and_Info/economic_news/collab_-fdi_into_india.pdf)




6. High Debt/GSDP of 29.7% (2015 Budget Estimate) compared to an India-average of 21.2%. Though that's an estimate, the 2014 Revised Estimate was 31% and 2013 actual one was 31.6%. I would take the estimate with a grain of sand.

2. And finally, **the extreme dependence on remittances:** Remittances finance as many as 20% Kerala households, or 2.4 million families. Assuming a family size of three, remittances directly affect 7.2 million of 35 million Keralites, according to a recent paper in the Economic and Political Weekly by K C Zachariah and S Irudaya Rajan based on the Kerala Migration Survey, 2014. [Source](http://www.firstpost.com/india/gulf-remittances-to-kerala-drop-to-four-year-low-due-to-declining-oil-prices-2738866.html)



* Remittances, at Rs 70,000 crore, accounted for 36.3% of the net state domestic product (NSDP) in 2014.



* Remittances constitute a fourth — Rs 22,689 of Rs 86,180 — of the per capita income of Kerala in 2014.



* Remittances were 1.2 times the revenue generated by the Kerala government in 2014.

I like this summary: **“Remittances from global capitalism are carrying the whole Kerala economy,”** said S. Irudaya Rajan, a demographer at the Center for Development Studies, a local research group. “There would have been starvation deaths in Kerala if there had been no migration. The Kerala model is good to read about but not practically applicable to any part of the world, including Kerala.” [Source: NYTimes- Jobs Abroad Support ‘Model’ State in India.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/world/asia/07migrate.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1) It's a pretty good read.

* Rumor mills even indicate that this is a stop‐gap arrangement and soon we could see a new Defense Minister, as handling 2 key ministries would be very challenging.

* Outgoing Defense Minister resolved issues like, One Rank One Pension (OROP), rolled‐out DPP, 2016 (addressed some of the Defense procurement issues with a view to encourage private sector participation), made policy changes to encourage MSME participation in the sector.

* Policy framework to encourage private sector participation, simplification of procurement procedures were based on recommendations of committee’s set‐up by him.

* However, with new Defense Minister taking the helm of affairs, we sense the key challenge would be to take forward unfinished work by the outgoing Defense minister at the earliest.

* The ‘Make in India’ is yet to kick off, as many private players having heavily invested in the sector are awaiting on the sideways to take on government orders for ships, helicopters and land systems.

* These projects are likely to be awarded under the ‘Strategic Partnership’ policy. For over 12 months, private sector has been asking for the award of such platform projects on competitive basis, whereas government wants to select private company for a long‐term 'guaranteed work' period.

* This difference of opinion has been a long bone of contention between the industry and Defense Ministry. The new Defense Ministry has to address this big issue as private sector has been long waiting with patience.

 * supply Interceptor boats developed by L&T & Private players,

 * 100 SPAD guns project to L&T in partnership with Korean company (project to cost ~Rs 9‐10 bn).
 * Also, RDEL signed strategic MoU with Emirates Defense Industries Company (UAE based integrated defense company).

* OFB bagging this project would give major fillip to them as they have been majorly dependent on IA for their orders. OFB makes 2 versions of shells, boat‐tail and base‐bleed versions.

* Boattail version is an older version and OFB has expertise in making indigenously this variant of shell. These shells are likely to be made at OFB’s Nagpur, Chandrapur and Bhandara plants.

* OFB to‐date has exported 50‐odd products (like Brake parachutes for Su30 & MiG‐29 Fighters, 91mm TRA gun for Navy, Small caliber Ammunition, Prahari‐ the 12.7 Air Defense Gun) to countries like Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, USA and Germany.

* On being awarded this Rs 2.35bn project, OFB’s exports order‐book will zoom‐up 10x (currently exports from OFB are in Rs200‐500mn range).
* We see this development to be very positive, as this is in line with our ex‐Defense Minister’s vision to promote India as Defense export hub. Ex‐Defense Minister had set $2 bn of Defense exports target from India for next 2 years. Growing ties with Mauritius, UAE, Vietnam and Myanmar indicate that Indian Defense eco‐system is working towards achievement of the $2bn Defense exports target.

**Update on Indo‐Russian delegates meet**

* On Mar 17‐18 both, Indian and Russian Defense ministries and corporate representatives met to discuss possibilities of manufacturing spare parts and ammunition for Russian origin Aircraft and Military platforms.
* India and Russia signed 2 Long‐Term Service Agreements (LTSA) for new spares delivery schedule from Russia, a logistics hub in Bangalore and domestic manufacturing of parts by HAL for 200 Su‐30MKI fighter jets, which in future would exceed to 270 Aircrafts. As per agreement, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and United Engine Corporation (UEC) will render technical support; provide maintenance services and spares to the fleet for next 5 years worth $300mn.
* The pacts were signed between HAL and the 2 Russian companies. UAC has acquired the right to supply spare parts and do the repair and servicing of the Aircraft it delivered earlier in Dec‐ 2016 only.
* UAC also signed an agreement with HAL to provide lifecycle support and maintenance for Mi‐17 helicopters, MiG‐29K fighter jet, T‐90 tanks and INS Vikramaditya Aircraft Carrier.
* On the sidelines of an event, Russian Trade and Industry Minister, Denis Manturov revealed that M&M subsidiary is working closely in creating the interiors for Sukhoi Super Jet. Russia is negotiating with M&M on MC‐21 Aircraft, a civil aviation project, which is soon to have its maiden flight soon. Also, Russia is negotiating with M&M and other private players to manufacture components for another project 2114 (a Commercial Aircraft project).
* Another Russian official confirmed that an agreement is soon to be finalized for the supply of 60 Multi‐purpose Kazan Helicopters under Phase‐I, whereas, joint facilities would be set up in India to manufacture another 140 helicopters.
* >60% of Indian Defense Equipment platforms procured since 1960’s are of Russian origin. The current serviceability rate of the IAF and IN fleet is <50% owing to lack of spares.
* We view deals between HAL and 2 Russian companies to be big positive, as IAF would now find ease in the procurement of spares from HAL. In 2014, the serviceability rates of Su‐30MKI fighter jets were at 46%. However, post setting‐up the Rs 4 bn after sales service centre for both, Su‐30MKI fighter jets & Helicopters, the serviceability rates have increased to 60%. In other words, it means that of the total fleet size of ~230 Su‐30MKI fighter jets, ~138 of them are ready for missions at any given time.
* MoD some time back had set an ardent task of increasing the serviceability rate to ~75% levels.
* This is in‐line with MoD’s strategy to bring the entire IAF Fighter Jet fleet to global serviceability standard of ~75% levels. This could be gauged from the recent Rafale deal signed, where the French government has promised India, that Rafale will ensure 75% serviceability rate. Also, steep penalties have been imposed if timelines are not adhered.
* We see the 2 agreements between HAL and the Russian companies for technical support; provide maintenance services and spares to the fleet for next 5 years to be in‐line with MoD’s strategy to further improve the serviceability rate of the Su‐30MKI Fighter Jet fleet.
* As a result of this initiative, we expect (1) spares cost (on per unit basis) to decline, and (2) DPSU’s and smaller unlisted players to benefit.
* Also, we see positive development from M&M subsidiaries point of view, as the much awaited uptick in their Aerospace business kick‐in. However, we see some meaningful contribution from the Russian side of Aerospace to be seen from FY2018 onwards only.
* Lastly, proposed JV for manufacture of Kazan Ka‐226T was an inter‐governmental agreement
* Signed in Dec‐2015, between Russian Helicopters, JSC Rosoboronexport & HAL. This agreement
assures localization of the production and supply of 200 Light Multi‐role Ka‐226T over a period
of 9 years. First 60 helicopters of them will be produced in Russia, while the remaining 140
helicopters will be produced in India.
* On a whole, this Indian‐Russian delegates meeting concluded with 2 deals signed and making way for few more in the pipeline.

**Lakshya‐II tested successfully**

* IAF successfully test‐flew the Advanced version of Pilot‐less Target Aircraft (PTA) Lakshya‐II on Mar‐15 from the Integrated Test Range off at Odisha coast.
* During the 30 minute flight, this PTA was made to dive at different altitudes, demonstrate various technologies and subsystems including software correction.
* This PTA has a sub‐sonic and re‐usable aerial target system, is remote controlled from ground and designed to impart training to both air‐borne and air‐defense pilots.
* It’s required to evaluate and develop trials of new surface‐to‐air and air to‐air weapon systems.
The test was carried out to check the validity of its engine and duration enhancement.
* Lakshya‐II is designed and developed by Bangalore‐based Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE), a DRDO lab.

*About Lakshya Project: 
Lakshya is a reclaimable Aerial target system designed to train guns, missile crews, Air defence pilots in order to engage the targets. Powered by gas turbine engines, it is designed to be launched from land or sea through a 0‐length launcher and can be recovered by a dual‐stage parachute system. Lakshya has been designed to be reused for 15 missions.*

* Since its first test in 2012, all tests done to‐date have been successful. Still we expect induction of Lakshya‐II in to IAF would take few more quarters as few more tests are to be done.
* HAL is only company in India currently producing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s) like PTA’s.
* To‐date HAL has made 39 of Lakshya‐I at its Aircraft division, Bangalore. Of this, ~23 of them have been inducted in to IAF, IN.
* In Feb‐2015, MoD approved DRDO proposal for transfer of technology (ToT) to L&T for commercial production of Lakshya. For every Lakshya produced and commercially sold, L&T would have to pay royalty to DRDO. L&T and Tata’s have been associated with Lakshya projects since very long time. L&T produced the Launcher for the IA version and Tata’s produced the Launcher for the IAF version.
* We are of view that L&T and DRDO have already worked jointly to build the production model for Lakshya‐II.
* Also, countries like, Israel, Singapore, Malaysia in the past have shown interest to acquire Lakshya. Even though no order has been made to‐date, there exists possibility of exporting Lakshya (with MoD approval).
* On a whole, induction of Lakshya‐II in to Indian Armed Forces would be positive for companies like, HAL, L&T and Tata’s, which have been involved at different stages of manufacturing Lakshya.

**OFB to produce Mango Shells for T‐90 Main Battle Tanks**

* Tecmash, a Rostec group company announced transfer of the main part of equipment needed to OFB for enabling production of Mango Shells for T‐90 tanks in India.
* Tecmash also finished training Indian specialists for the production of Mango shells.
* Mango shells are feathered armor‐piercing projectiles for 125 mm caliber tank guns.
* Production of the shells was launched in the USSR in 1983 and put into service in 1986.
* This development comes in the back‐drop of a contract to supply 66,000 Mango Shells was signed with India in 2014 worth $ 470mn.
* We view this to be positive development as it adds one more feather to OFB’s capabilities to make Mango Shells, which are used by T‐90 Tanks. Given that the final batch of these Mango Shells was delivered recently, we do not see a large ticket awarding for these Mango shells by IA in the next 3‐6 months at least.


**IAF to get 6 new C‐130J S with Terrain Warning System**

* As per solicitation posted by US Air Force on US Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps), IAF is to get 6 new Lockheed Martin C‐130J Hercules Transport Aircraft equipped with Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS). This subscription will run for 40 months starting 31 May‐ 2017 through till 31 Aug‐2020.
* Responses for this solicitation are to be submitted by Mar‐30, 2017.
* IAF currently fields 4 C‐130Js, having ordered 6 of them in 2008 (as 2 of them met accidents).
* These 6 Aircrafts that are being solicited were contracted in Dec‐2013 for $ 1.1 bn.
* As with the current fleet, these Aircraft are to be fitted with defensive aids, Indian‐specific communication systems, and chin‐mounted electro‐optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensor turrets.
* Solicitation to get the new 6 Lockheed Martin C‐130J Hercules Transport Aircraft equipped with Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) indicates that government is focused to spend on Aircraft safety. TAWS are being deployed globally to prevent the occurrence of any accidents.
* It is after 2 of the C‐130J Hercules got damaged in 2014 & 2017 MoD took the decision to equip TAWS in to these 6 new Military Transport Aircrafts to avoid any further accidents.
* On a whole, we see this to be a positive development for the IAF fleet.

**Earnings-Palooza Continues**

The festivities for the quarter ending March continued with Airtel [reporting](http://www.firstpost.com/business/bharti-airtels-q4-profits-up-15-per-cent-rise-in-subscribers-for-mobile-internet-2753518.html) a 3% increase in net profits and a subscriber total of 35 million Indians. Airtel’s gain turned out to be Idea’s pain. Shares of Idea traded down after the company [reported](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/markets/indian-markets/idea-cellular-stocks-today-on-bse-sensex-nse-nifty-on-april-29-2016/245221/) almost 40% decrease in profits. That had to have hurt. The main event of the week were the banks that were reporting earnings. Profits at Axis Bank [fell](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/LlwW49im93N1GmvPrUm64H/Q4-results-Axis-Bank-profit-falls-for-the-first-time-in-46.html) almost 2% as bad loans went up - it’s the bank’s first decline in quarterly profits in over a decade. ICICI Bank, the country’s largest private sector bank, [reported](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/icici-bank-q4-profit-hit-by-provisioning-116042900307_1.html) a 76% decline in profits, the sharpest decline of quarterly profits ever in its entire history. Records like that are probably best left unbroken. Just as you breath a sign that after results like those, the worst is probably over - you realize it really isn’t. Both banks said that they expected the amount of bad loans to increase for a few quarters. Shareholders of bank stocks better get used to the pain of being burned by bad loans. Masochist shareholders of bank stocks can relax.


**Maruti Suzuki**: **:’(**

Delhi’s odd-even rule has drawn a lot of flak from residents who are being forced to take the bus every other day and smell the smells of the people on the bus. Among those unhappy has to be Maruti Suzuki, India’s biggest car maker. Maruti’s results for the first quarter of 2016 [reported](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/live-maruti-suzuki-q4-results-fy16-net-profit-sales-revenue-margins/243113/) a 12% decline in profits. Interestingly, the company cites the Jat reservation agitation as one of the reasons for a fall in profits. But there are also people who are happy with the odd-even rule. Like a 13-year old boy who registered the domain odd-even.com and [sold](http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Remember-The-13YearOld-Who-Created-The-OddEven-Website-Has-Now-Sold-It-To-Orahi/) it to carpooling app, Orahi and now attends advisory board meetings at Orahi as a technical expert, presumably right after watching Chota Bheem. Sticking to the theme, chalk this one up as win for the militant environmentalists - Mahindra is planning to [build](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-mahindra-to-build-indias-first-automobile-shredding-plant-2016-4) India’s first automobile shredding plant that will focus on destroying 100,000 units of old cars, ships and machines per year. They should upload videos of machines crushing cars to YouTube.

**Let’s Pretend Like This Is A Creative Title**

Every time there’s technological progress, people piss themselves silly telling everyone that machines will take all our jobs now. That has been happening since the past decade or so and likely started when they invented swords to replace the jobs of all the people who made pointy sticks. But today, there is a special kind of irony when the engineers who make machines and software that replace other people’s jobs start getting replaced by software and machines themselves. One of Infosys’ co-founders says growth in hiring has [decreased](http://www.businessinsider.in/Heres-why-automation-AI-is-good-news-for-IT-companies-and-bad-news-for-you/articleshow/52037635.cms) by 40% over the past 10 years and will likely fall further. And it’s all happening because of automation in the IT industry. There’s only one job available for every five engineers graduating every year. Psh, and they said arts students don’t get jobs. Due to this increased supply and reduced demand, salaries for new hires [stayed](http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate/no-salary-hike-for-freshers-in-it-space-amid-hiring-blues/52019188) pretty much the same despite a booming IT industry. Indians who opted for the road less traveled despite family pressure to pursue engineering cannot stop smiling right now.

**Last Week In Vijay Mallya’s Life**

Not to jump on the bandwagon of hating him because it’s cool now, but that Mallya fellow just can’t stay out of the news media, try as he might. Either that or the news media just can’t stay out of Mallya’s life, and they don’t even try. Brands confiscated by the banks a few weeks ago like ‘Fly the Good Times’ and ‘Fly Kingfisher’ were [put](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/logistics/lenders-begin-auction-of-brand-kingfisher-trademarks/article8540946.ece) on auction for the second time. And for the second time, nobody was stupid enough to make a bid. The minimum price was set at ₹367 crore. It’s safe to say - those brands are poisonous by now. The Supreme Court [directed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sc-directs-vijay-mallya-to-furnish-details-of-assets-in-india-abroad/) Mallya to declare all his foreign and domestic assets to the banks so they can be better prepared at the negotiations table. Mallya isn’t back in the news. He just never left the news. They also just [revoked](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/india-revokes-passport-of-vijay-mallya-who-fled-to-london-owing-13bn) his passport - and being an MP, he’s even got one of those shiny red diplomatic passports, which is now useless. That last sentence was written before news broke that Mallya had [resigned](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vijay-mallya-resigns-from-rajya-sabha/article8547747.ece) from the Rajya Sabha -  so now that shiny red diplomatic passport is really useless.

**Bros Again: Reliance and Iran**

The Iranian Revolution of 1979 overthrew the ruling dynasty in Iran which was supported by the US. Since this was a matter of internal politics in a sovereign country outside the US territory, the US had to respond, as is tradition - and it promptly imposed economic sanctions, which were recently lifted. Reliance, which has substantial investments in the US, had suspended trade with Iran for fears of being dragged through the mud in the US. But last week, Reliance [resumed](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/reliance-buys-iranian-oil-after-6-year-hiatus_6377461.html) buying oil from Iran after almost 6 years. Talking about oil - oil prices have crashed the floor and everyone’s predicting the end of Saudi Arabia as we know it. There was even talk about an IPO for Saudi Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, to raise cash and douse the fire lit by falling oil prices. If there is a fire, the kingdom is trying to hide the smoke. Saudi Aramco is now actually looking to [expand](http://www.indiainfoline.com/article/news-top-story/saudi-aramco-mulling-offers-for-indian-oil-refinery-stakes-pradhan-116042600203_1.html) and buy stakes in Indian petrochemical projects, possibly in a planned oil refinery on the west coast.

Amazon is doing great. But Apple has seen better days. It reported a 22% fall in profits for the previous quarter. Its stock is down 15% for the month.

*A similar series titled ['](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/imitation-is-the-sincerest-form-of-flattery)Last Week In Indian Parliament' that aims to summarize the proceedings of the parliament every week was just started by /u/kumbhakaran.

1456511511.0,6,93,424,"Amidst the prolonged JNU controversy &amp; Jat Quota stir, one big development is constantly being ignored for the past two weeks. Our Banks (PSBs) have declared they have [4.4 lakh crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/at-rs-4-lakh-crore-bad-loans-exceed-market-value-of-psu-banks/articleshow/51078318.cms) worth Non Performing Assets (NPAs) as of December 2015. 

Here, I will attempt to break it all down in layman terms. What, why, when and how it affects us, the taxpayer. I'm no finance expert, so please point out any errors I make. I had to go through a lot of complicated jargon (it's weird how these things are always so complicated) to make sense of it.

**What are NPAs and why should we care?**

Loans whose three consecutive installments are not paid are classified as Non Performing Assets (NPAs). After an NPA or bad loan is declared, the bank can initiate the process of recovery and restructuring of that loan. It will try to get new management to run projects, auction off collateral and try to recover the amount, which is rarely equivalent to the amount of loan given. Especially in case of big loans. 

The NPAs that have been declared recently are mostly by big corporate borrowers (according to some sources, around 65-70% of total defaulters are big corps). Take the example of Vijay Mallaya. Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore. Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore. 

On top of it, [Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/budget/article-vijay-mallya-resigns-from-united-spirits-gets-rs-515-crore-1281435?pfrom=home-lateststories) and got a payout of ~~$515 million~~ Rs 515 crore. Good times for him while the 17 banks unitedly struggle to recover the loan amount. 

**So if the loans can't be recovered, what happens to the banks?** 

Simply put, they register losses, throw up their hands and tell the Government, ""Sorry [boss, can't get these loans back](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/state-run-banks-like-sbi-bank-of-baroda-central-bank-of-india-apprise-pm-narendra-modi-of-rising-bad-loans/articleshow/50990898.cms). We need to make profits. Pliss to help."" 

**What will the Government do about this?**

One word: Bailout. 
This whole thing is turning into a big cluster fuck. 'Sources' have been saying the government is planning to infuse Rs 70,000 crore till 2019 into PSBs to calm things down. They have already infused Rs 20,000 crore this year. This amount will not help banks deal with the problem in totality but it's a temporary measure to ensure they don't just collapse under the weight of NPAs. 

**Does that Government have enough money to save the banks?**

No. 

Here's a few things which the government has to spend on in the near future:

1) [Food Security Act](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-02-03/news/70313785_1_national-food-security-act-prime-minister-narendra-modi-food-subsidy) 

2) [MGNREGA](http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2016/02/nda-pursuing-mgnrega-bengal-and-up-election/)

3) [Seventh pay commission](http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/of-the-servants-by-the-servants-for-the-servants/)

5) [Increased Defence allocation](http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2016-17/expert-columns/defence-budget-allocation-likely-to-see-minimum-10-per-cent-hike/story/229336.html)

The revenue, on the other hand, doesn't seem that rosy. The government has [kept the fuel prices high](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/excise-duty-hiked-on-petrol-by-re-1litre-on-diesel-by-rs-1-5/) to get excise duty on it. The finance minister has been saying this is being done to reduce our fiscal deficit, which is fair. But then in that case where will the money for 'capital infusion in banks' come from? 

(I have to point out here that the first two expenditure items I mentioned are something that the present government has avoided spending on much till now. I don't blame them because the GST plan didn't really work out, so they have to go on an appeasement spree to calm their voters.)

**Well, that's all dandy well awesome but who's fault is it?**

This problem, unfortunately, cannot be pinned down on a single person or party. So I've made a list! 

1) *Raghuram Rajan / Reserve Bank of India*

The banks have been more or less forced to declare these loans because Raghuram Rajan sent notices telling them to clean up their balance sheets. He did this so that the banks can start a fresh cycle of loan disbursements to boost investment in the country. It's a good move in the long term but it all depends on whether the banks are in a position to handle the burden at this point of time.

A Supreme Court bench recently [pulled up the RBI to ask WTF is happening](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-debts-rbi-supreme-court-bank-defaulters/). 

&gt; The bench headed by Chief Justice asked, ""People are owing thousands of crore to the public banks… it is a big fraud. Top ten public sector banks have written off Rs 40,000 crore alone in 2015. It is all there in this Indian Express report. Public financial institutions are lending money despite knowing no returns. RBI is supposed to keep a watch on these banks. What are you doing about it?”

They asked RBI to submit a list of defaulters with loans over Rs 500 crore. To which the RBI replied:

&gt; “The required information is not available with us. Banks are required to report the bad loans on a consolidated basis.""

Personally, I find this response really strange because a periodic reporting of big loans is done to both the Finance Ministry and RBI. How can they ask the banks to ~~waive off~~ write-off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of who the big defaulters are? 

*2) Manmohan Singh / Previous UPA Government*

If anyone is to blame, it's them. These loans which are being declared NPAs have been given during their time. They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money, but they didn't. So they have left this huge crumbling mass of debt which is all coming out. Like pus from a wound. Ugh.

*3) Narendra Modi / Present NDA Government*

If this capital infusion a.k.a. bailout continues and the economy gets in trouble, the NDA government will be definitely blamed for it. The whole point is that they are now in power and they have to clean up the mess even if they want to blame the previous government for it. The people will not forgive the BJP for a major (possibly catastrophic) economic downturn, no matter who is responsible for it. 

Modi has projected himself, right from the beginning, as the savior of the economy. Now that the economy is facing a challenge, he can't afford to point fingers at UPA. But he will, he most definitely will. Rightfully so, but that won't help matters at all.

*4) Faceless, nameless / The Banks*

Aah yes. These frikkin Bankers. The biggest culprits are the bank managers who are responsible for due diligence before disbursing loans. If there is an NPA in a particular bank branch, the manager is held responsible for it. In case of big loans, the top management has to give approvals and they are also held responsible. 

Through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft, the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans. They didn't have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in. Until Rajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loans. 

*5) Big Corporates*

The usual suspects. They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts. Just like Vijay Mallya did. They have, in the past decade or so, taken a lot of loans which are now proving to be bad assets for the banks. Even the Economic survey has pointed out that these [corporate debts are worrisome](http://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/perspective/economic-survey-corporate-debts-consumer-spend-monsoons/story/229607.html). They have called it 'The Twin Balance Sheet Problem'... which makes no sense to me...

Some projects haven't taken off due to land acquisition issues, Infrastructure problems and environmental clearances. There is limited investment coming in from abroad. Therefore, the government was eager to push GST and all of these investment driving schemes for the past two years. Didn't really work out as they planned. Even if they manage to pave the way for these pending projects, the corporations are known to delay and milk them for maximum profits. (Eg: KG Basin, IGI Airport and many more.) 

**So what happens next? Also, TLDR.**

To put it simply: The taxpayer gets f'ed in the a. As always.

1375102453.0,6,46,2,"Play along with me for a minute.

1. Sen has been making clearly partisan comments wherein he is kissing up to the Gandhi family, while spitting at those who are against the Gandhi family.

2. Sen knows that UPA is done for in the next elections. Which means, Pappu will go run behind his mummy's skirts after the trouncing in 2014.

3. Sen might be hoping that by 2019 or earlier, whichever government is in power, may be facing anti-incumbency. If it is a third-front banana republic govt, it will happen much earlier than 2019. Even if it is an NDA govt, Sen might be hoping that people will not like the Modi-brand of governance and there will be high anti-incumbency factor. High hopes, but everyone can dream!

4. So, Sen might see a possibility for UPA to come back in 2019 or earlier. But now, Pappu has not recovered from his 2014 trouncing. He, his mummy and other Congis have realized that Pappu's role is better relegated to the background where he has all the authority, and zero accountability. Exactly like his mummy. So, they have to find a slave PM who *appears* acceptable to Indians, which could be Chidambaram. Chidambaram could be for Pappu, what MMS is to Sonia. In that case, who will be the Finance Minister? Why? Our own Nobel laureate, of course.

**5. And who knows, a few more years down the line, once the trend of FMs becoming PMs has been well established by MMS and PC, Sen could also claim the PM's seat.**

Can't an economist with questionable economic theories dream? After all, other than being an economist, he has another crucial qualification that could make him a very acceptable PM candidate for Indians: a white-skinned foreign wife! Sen the economist and [his big banking family wife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Georgina_Rothschild) could continue with the looting of India, which has been going on for centuries now, almost unbroken. Except, Mr and Mrs Sen would bring a whole new level of sophistication to it, making Sonia-Rajiv-Quattrocchis look like amateur small timers. After all, Mrs Sen's family's bank has already managed to get a [fat 30+ crore-rupee fee](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/thomas-k-thomas/sbi-caps-keen-on-spectrum-auctioneer-job/article3704210.ece) from the UPA govt for one of the spectrum auction/sale.

1415287315.0,6,5,69,"If there's one thing that we, here on /r/India, can all agree on is that Money is important. Not just for the economy of our country but also for us as individuals.  Personal finance, in very simple words, is the management of *your own* Monetary resources. . And although it may seem like a term that is thrown around a lot only recently, your parents and grandparents, etc have, in fact, practised it in some form too. For example: If you send money to your parents every month, that is a return on their investment in you. If you've seen your parents set aside a part of their money every month to pay for bills and fees, that is budgeting. In fact, all monetary decisions that they've taken in their lives, as a family, come under the subject matter of personal finance.


So, just like we try and focus on our physical, mental and spiritual health, focusing on developing our financial health is important too and hence, matters of personal finance and investing your time in understanding it is of significance to EVERYBODY who draws a salary or earns an income from a business/profession.


Although we, at /r/IndiaInvestments do try our best to address your queries on the matters of personal finance too, but [the person we have coming over](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/2l56m0/upcoming_ama_manish_chauhan_founder_of/) has been in the financial advisory business for quite a while and his blog and books are of quite a lot of repute for their resourcefulness to not just other financial advisers, but also for people who are trying to improve their personal financial health.

* I (or somebody I know) have had bad experiences with the stock market, Or, I don't understand any of it so I'd rather stay away. What am I missing?



* I can see that a particular stock/scheme has been doing well for the past few months, should I go All-in?


* I have surplus savings. Should I repay my home loan or invest it elsewhere?


* Planning to quit my job and start out on my own, How do I decide if I can afford to quit?


* What is the best way to deal with the bonus that I just received?


* We are expecting a child and would like to see the child get the best kind of education. What can I do starting today towards that?


* I've always wanted to visit Japan, but ever since I started working, something or the other comes up and I barely have enough money to even think about it. What do I do?


* Mutual Fund ratings and stock broker recommendations. How much of these should I trust?


* I have bought an endowment/ULIP insurance plan recently. Can I feel confident that my family is secured?


* What is the difference between a Life Insurance policy, Health insurance policy and a Personal Accident cover? Do I need these?


* I just saw this advertisement about an IPO. All my friends are investing in it. Should I?


* I am an NRI. I hear that the interest rates on fixed deposits are upto 9%-10% in India. Should I send my money to invest in India?


* I am an NRI and I expect the rupee to get stronger. Should I convert all my savings now?


* It's tax declaration time and I am looking for tax savings product. What do I do?


* What happens if I don't file my Income Tax returns?


* A friend/relative of mine suggests that I put in money in a certain stock or scheme or business venture. What are the points that I need to keep in mind before I take a plunge?


* I have a CA friend who helps me file taxes every year. Do I still need a financial planner?


* Are financial planners only for the rich? 


* How do I evaluate a financial planner?


* A portion of my salary goes towards EPF, does that mean I'll have enough money when I retire?


* Besides extra penalty interest, what's the worse that can happen if I don't pay my credit card bills?

1510163182.0,6,4,3,"Hi
Am just a normal internet user from some city of India and have been touring out in many different countries from last few years.

I really love my nation and while travelling I found that we have everything what other so called developed countries have than why are we still developing?

I generally came up with few more questions while browsing through so many social networking and news channels and other print media.

I Have 1 general question from all the citizens of this country, Don't you think that the only problem is we are been fooled by few politicians?

Why I came up with this question.
I don't think all other countries with such huge population are safest for women's or they don't have any crime happening or there are no bankrupt or jobless people roaming around, every country has this and this is just a part of it.

What makes difference.
Some countries have low population and so they have managed to have better law and low rate of law breakers, some countries are so open for sex and everything that they don't have sex taboo guys roaming around to harm girls, some countries high rate of literacy and there are huge tax payers and the government is so rich that in very average amount of tax also they manage to serve the best to country and there are some countries which has huge population but they work strictly on business and make more and more vacancies to leave less unemployment in the country.

Now what this country is working on?
I found that none of the political parties are actually trying to solve the issue or jobs and tax payers and if some think of trying it out (not only now but even when congress tried few better step) the oppositions and others just try to criticize them and they try best to fool people and get rid of this solutions and try to misguide the citizens of our country.

Root cause,
No political party is trying for the best awareness and is opened up for space for public voice.

Reason:
Everyone is scared of loosing there position.

I don't say demonetization is right or wrong i am just a common man who has not studied finance or i do not know how gst is effecting people because i was not a trader or so, but i know only one thing that if stop criticizing everything and work together for benefit even for next one 3-4 years i think this country would be most powerful and most dominating in the world in ever space.

With all this criticism, blame game, dirty politics we are not heading towards any solution we are in a loop of destruction we will always be behind few other countries and we will always be developing country because the condition of been developed country keeps varying every generation with the high end techs and literacy.

We need to work together for awareness, jobs, tax payers and food quality rather then seeing who is low level scammer or who is shouting higher.

Please be aware we are not moving towards development if this situation is continued and maximum people stay against government always.

I pardon for my language if i have misspelled or there is a grammatical issues, I am not a blog writer but i am really in pain with the way things are going and if we all don't stand to support any government in position all together we will always be in the same situation forever, and i think this is the right time to open eyes and start supporting because we need a government with majority and this is that government lets support them maximum and give a try we have no other option when you have to bare it anyways why not supporting while voting again don't vote them thats all.

&nbsp;

All your life, all you've ever wanted, is a little bit of money. And congratulations, now you have it. Does it feel nice? Does it feel like a dream come true? Of course it doesn't. It's all just numbers on a screen, staring at you like a pathetic joke. But thanks to your thankless job, you made yourself a little bit of money. How nice.

And now, you, in all your half-decayed intelligence, have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that you've made? Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. 

But don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.

Before you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. 

&nbsp;
##### Savings are sexy
Let's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.

&nbsp;
##### Debt is your kryptonite
So you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.

&nbsp;
##### Read like your life depends on it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.

&nbsp;
##### Gold is old
Gold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.

&nbsp;
##### Insurance =/= Investing
While housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.

&nbsp;
##### Real estate is not real investing
The only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.

&nbsp;
##### Pick your poison properly
Identifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.

&nbsp;
##### Get yourself into a coma
The best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.

&nbsp;
##### Don't watch CNBC
All your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.

&nbsp;
##### Keep It Simple, Shithead
Here is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:
 
|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |
| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |
 
When you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.

&nbsp;

This basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? 

The lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.

Always keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.

1506586980.0,6,0,3,"Although the budget is only one of the important times major policy changes are made the budget in 2018 will be crucial for India and NDA.

*Current situation* :

GDP growth down to 5.7%. Remember that if we use old method  of GDP calculation this 5.7% is actually 3.7%.

Inflation at 5 month high, https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi

Credit growth is down by a lot, http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/c-p-chandrasekhar/growth-in-the-time-of-a-credit-squeeze/article9795693.ece

Overall tax collections are down, http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/modi-govt-eyes-spending-cuts-as-gst-hits-tax-collection-117091800860_1.html

Job situation is abysmal, even when economy was growing at 7% the job growth rate was 1% in an already very informal economy with few jobs.

Fiscal deficit has already shot past the target, http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-fiscal-deficit-reaches-92-4-per-cent-of-full-year-target-in-july/articleshow/60308723.cms

Crude price is at 4 month high. This may temporarily mean higher GDP growth because margins for oil companies etc will go up. In long term it puts more pressure on FM.

Global situation is likely to be stable.

*Questions* :-

With tax collections dropping FM cannot boost GDP with government expenditure. I doubt the government will give a stimulus package without a major hit to fiscal deficit targets.

With inflation high RBI has less leeway in reducing interest rates.

Will Govt cut spending on social schemes like NREGA so close to 2019? Will govt spend less on Armed forces?

Most importantly for me personally, will government cut corporate taxes, income taxes?

Will Modi be able to use executive prowess i.e. fast clearances, attracting investments, inspire confidence to get GDP growth back on track?

What is the actual impact of GDP slowdown to common man voter of modi?

1490557961.0,6,7,0,"There are many polices initiated by NDA after they came to power. 
For example,
* Financial inclusion
* The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015
* Direct subsidies
* Aadhaar
* Demonetization
* Recent financial bill etc

When we take a closer look at these policies, we can see a certain pattern of corruption and dirty politics in them.

For example, **the electoral Bonds** ( http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/explaining-electoral-bonds-in-india/article9524904.ece) . This is a policy to increase the fund of the BJP and its allies. Now, people can buy this bonds and fund parties anomalously. While the identity of the donor is captured, it is not revealed to the party or public. So transparency is not enhanced for the voter. 

No doubt, The denomination has removed dirty money from the market. Now, political parties do not have access to hoarded money to fund their election just like before. In a country like India, where a good part of population is ready to sell their vote for money due to their ignorance or lack of knowledge, this is a big blow to opposing parties like congress. 

The Aadhaar became a surveillance tool for the govt. The NDA govt had amended the 2010 Aadhaar act with some scary stuff last year. Source : https://thewire.in/118655/hello-aadhaar-goodbye-privacy/

Now there are 22 mandatory notification for **voluntary** Aadhaar in this year.  Source : https://thewire.in/115125/aadhaar-timeline-mandatory-notifications/

The recent financial bill gave more (read ultimate) power to tax wing. They can inspect and seize anything they want, wherever they want and whenever they want now. 

You may ask all this are good, right? 

Maybe not. 

For example,take the example of The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015 . The penalty for nondisclosure of foreign income or assets would be equal to three times the amount of tax payable, in addition to tax payable at 30%. But if you want to get out of the hook, buy an electoral bond and bribe the party in position. The govt has guaranteed the anonymity of the donor. Sure, the issuing bank has the data of the buyer, but since all national banks are coming under a single roof under government, the promise of anonymity and receiver not knowing about the name of donor, the banks, donor and parties are safe in the bribing process. 

And, if someone want to protest against all these, be careful , you are naked in front of the govt. All your data, your financial, assets, tele identity, everything is there in front of them. What they have to do is just pull a bizarre thing like porn, torrent downloads etc into paper and screw you. Or they can seek the help of the funded medias and shame you in front of public. 

The govt. has already said that privacy is not a fundamental rights. We are losing our faith in judiciary anyway. Here is more info on mass surveillance in India. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_India 

Oh, did I forgot to tell you that babus can no longer speak against the govt? http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rules-framed-civil-servants-not-allowed-to-criticise-govt-on-social-media/story-FVEtcWbAvsM7NjmPgPqgQK.html 

India is soon going to be like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_(film) . Opposition and the elite can do nothing because they have to hide their own arse. When the lion feed on wolves, the wolves should feed on chickens. 

If you think that **if you are good all is good** , it is time to think again. We all are not ""good"" in every eyes.

1463178616.0,6,8,11,"I wanted to post this to r/relationships, but would have taken time explaining all the caste shit, so here I am.

So, I am not a bramhim. I am from OBC who doesn't have any official paper saying that I am OBC because it won't mean much (=no monetary benefits). I am from a well-off family and I won't even need any monetary help/ reservation either. My native place is pretty small.. barely a population of 500-600 peeps. All members of my family are in the upper middle class bracket (how do I know? Well, we went from shopping for groceries for 100-500 rs, to shop for ""aesthetic"" art stuff at Jahangir Art Gallery). 

Shit is about to hit the fan so buckle up!

A month ago, my relative from native place married the woman of his dreams who doesn't belong to our caste. We are all cool with it because he did really love her and so did she and she was almost like my elder sister (I don't have one). Everyone in my family is okay, however, whenever there's talk about their marriage, my mom will always quote ""see? both his (relative's father) kids married to persons from different caste"". And this tone is always so fucking terrible, and what worst that my entire clan only SHOWS to be okay with it which I found out like yesterday.

She(bride) mingles very well with the 14-21 age group in the family. She is 25 I think and my relative is 28, it doesn't matter cause they do seem great and while he has to a stable job, she works at home and runs a beauty salon in nearby city and it's going well. The relative's elder sister (40+) also married a guy outside the caste and she was completely abandoned by her parents, till they realized that she was basically handing all finances. They ""forgave"" her, yet treat as if she no longer has any business in ""her"" family.

WHAT. THE. FUCK. IS. THIS.

Now, what's worst that all the people mentioned above at at least metric (matrix pass? 12th? Idk.) rest are graduated in professional field - medicine, accounting, engineering and everyone lives in a respected society and yet this bag of deepshit!!!

Now, now, as I said I don't have a caste certificate, because my grandpa (dada) was too lazy to care about it. However, my nani got my 2 cousins registered and this blew up the family like fucking Tsar Bomba. My cousins didn't want any affiliation because we all are good in academics and we can pretty much afford the fees for general category. We (as in my cousins and I) think that it's just a disability certificate and that an entire generation hasn't used it (my mom and mamas didn't have it) so we won't use it either. Now, You would say that's good because, well we aren't being asshole, but my family literally wants us (the future gen.) to be one. Yet, these guys will criticize the ""free-loaders"" and your daily WhatsApp shitposting. If irony were indeed a person, it would have like shot itself fucking a billion times. Y U SO STUPID?

Now, as we (the new gen.) are hitting 20s, our parents are like do you like any guy/grill? Hope he/she isn't a bramhin. Don't bring us shame. While, the irony is that we all have family friends who are bramhin - that too Punekars (esp in VilleParle)!! My best friends right from school to college are bramhins. I didn't gave a fuck about it, but have to admit that bramhin make the best fucking amti in the whole universe. Take that mom!! We literraly grew up in a bramhin environment and never have I ever seen this kind of fucked up shit in ANY of my or my cousins' friends family. Like, seriously, bramhins - the ones I have met and grew up with - are the most liberal folks. YOu call them all the names, but they would alwyas stick by you and drown you in their best fucking amti with ghee. Very close knitted and very very open minded. 

Now, the guy I have been with is a bramhin and my mom knows this. She is too prude to ask me about him so she just checks my phone bill to see whom I call the most. 

OTOH, my man's mom has called me many times and we talk like 2-3 times a week, and damn she is a fucking marshmallow. I am gonna steal her if I don;t get to marry my man. She is like the most humble, yet funny mom anyone could ever have. She doesn't know shit about FB and as my man works and I am still pursuing masters, I help her with it and god, she is amazing! All his cousins and elder than us and some even have kids. I haven;t met all of them, but they too, do know about us and tease my man. Lol, he blushes more than I do :p Many of his cousins have married out of caste (I asked him out of curiosity once), but no one is really interested in gossips as long as they are happy. Only this one guy had 498A misused against him, so his clan has been a little susceptible since, but that's about it. Every lady cousin of his went to a even warm home and all his ""vahinis"" are super close and cool. Yes, they still live in a Wada. 20+ folks under one roof!! 

My parents have been separated since my birth. Later, she had a fling with this guy who abused me, but she didn;t care. I grew out of it thanks to my hostel counselor and later, this guy I met - fucking love him he is my best friend!

I am almost like a family member to his little family of three. But, my mom won;t say anything about it at all. It's like, she doesn;t care or it's breaking her heart to see me go away, whatever. his mom always ask me how was my days and we regularly chat (I am in mumbai and he and his family is in Pune). I even taught her Skype. This is like, the sunshine I want and on the other hand, my own folks are deep in the darkness like caste, shaming and shit.

Holy shit. It's 2016. Why do I even have to care about it? Aren;t we (my clan) educated? These folks will go on and on with their ultra right wing shit and India needs discipline (like dictator ship) and reservations should be abolished and shit and yet behave like living in 1600s mindset (whatever that means!).

Now, recently, my mom has got really passive aggressive about how being a women is about having family, children and stuff. 

To top it off, this is what she said when we had a talk about children.

I was telling how a painful past of a child fucks up the puberty ago/ teenage hood, to which she just said, it's the choice of parents to bring a child in this world. God has given me you so I get to choose what to do with you. To which I said, but a child is a human too, he has rights as well. To which she said, no. All children are gift of god and only parents will decide for them.  

NO. YOU HAVE SEX TO HAVE BABIES. HOLY SHIT. WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT WE ARE NOT HAVING THIS TALK????? 

Where do I go from here? I can't move out and she is like turning into some batshit fucking crazy person. She did everything on her own, bought a home, a car, raised me (in hostels though), manages all finances of her own and mine and now, she is hitting 50s and this shit has started. She goes like, now you'll be gone (married) and then who will look after her as she doens;t even have a son and shit like that. 

I am losing my shit. and this IS NOT a shitpost.

Hey everyone, thanks for reading. The upcoming school year, I will travel to India (from the Netherlands) to study at Amrita University. The folks from the exchange office are really helpful and the process is going pretty smooth, but I still have some questions which I hoped (some of) you could help me answer.

I would like to know:
-How intensive/stressful is studying at Amrita (is there a difference between foreigners and Indians)?
-Which campus should I choose?
-How is campus life and how much free time will I have?

Of all the cities with campuses, I have only been to Bangalore (yet only briefly). I did not like the city very much, but I heard that it is the IT capital of India.

I am currently studying International Business and I want to follow mostly courses on finance when I go to Amrita. I have looked at a number of electives and I the finance courses quite appeal to me. Furthermore mathematics and technology greatly interest me. I would like to travel as much as possible and learning Hindi would be a priority for me.

Please share with me your experiences, tips, tricks and other things you think will be helpful.

Thanks a lot in advance!

FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: “I am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act”. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire — learning to unlearn yesterday’s wisdom.

Experts in the field of solid waste management know that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan can become the biggest employer, and solve several issues.

Especially girls r subjected to violence every second in the co (Nirbhaya funds were alloted after the gruesome delhi rape case.)


What’s the current status on the Uniform Civil Code?



FEDERAL DEMOCRACY


1. It is obvious that a number of states with different parties in power are doing some things right, going by the positive outcomes. Federal Democracy is here to stay. But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere.


2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka.



HEALTH CARE



Why does the government not take inspiration from NHS scheme in the UK (which provides efficient and great healthcare to UK residents)?

**Food (Wastage, Inflation)**

Shin Chan used to separate out *shimla mirch* from his meals and throw them in the trash because he didn’t like them. And also because he didn’t understand the economics of food wastage and inflation in modern India. A review by Economic Times last week [reported](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/food-wastage-can-cost-a-family-rs-80-lakh/articleshow/53127874.cms) that if the average family reduces food wastage by half and invested the savings at 10% returns, it can add up to ₹21 lakh in 30 years. However, that is not a static number since food prices tend to rise with inflation. And the inflation numbers for June [back](http://www.firstpost.com/business/cpi-inflation-at-5-77-should-ring-alarm-bells-for-new-rbi-governor-2890602.html) that claim. Food inflation was at 7.79% in June, up from 7.47% in May. Specifically, inflation in vegetables was about 14% in June, up from about 10% in May. So the next time your mother tells you to eat your vegetables, just pinch your nose and eat those godforsaken things that masquerade around as food. While that number only looks at food prices, consumer inflation which looks at prices in general stayed pretty much the same at 5.77%. Far from being a reason to pop open the champagne, “pretty much the same” still means a 22-month high. That 5.77% number should ring alarm bells for the RBI because if it crosses 6%, the RBI is required to explain to the government why it failed at keeping inflation in check. 

  

**The Business Of Cricket**

Baba Karl Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. But in India, you could easily replace religion with cricket in that sentence and it would still stand true. With cows being the only thing more sacred that cricket in India, all that religious obsession over cricket has made gods out of cricketers. And cricketers have raked in the money as they’ve turned themselves into a brand. Just a short list of businesses that Virat Kohli owns partly or entirely includes a chain of fitness centers, a clothing line, a tennis team, a football team, a wrestling team and a sport-based social network. And he’s adding one more to that list. Mr. Kohli is now a co-owner of his own [fanclub](http://yourstory.com/2016/05/virat-kohli-fanbox-privyplex/) called ‘Virat FanBox’ that sells a branded edition of Moto G smartphone that comes preloaded with his app that gives users exclusive access to him. With a price tag of ₹16,999, Virat FanBox also gets you a signed miniature cricket bat and one-year subscription to his fanclub. And of course, it has to come in a box, otherwise the name wouldn’t make sense. Time for a confession - that was news in May, not last week. Last Week In Indian Economy, bringing you week-old, and sometimes even months-old stale and smelly news since 2016. More recently though, last week Dhoni’s apparel and footwear brand Seven [marked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/dhonis-brand-seven-grosses-over-2-5-million-in-three-months/articleshow/53221126.cms) a milestone of $2.5 million in sales just three months after launching. 

  

**Gotta Catch ‘Em All!**

It started with Angry Birds. Then came Flappy Bird. And now we don’t exactly have another bird, but we have Pokemon Go. The augmented reality mobile gaming app has instantly catapulted to so much popularity that it is now bigger than Tinder and Twitter. The internet managed to give it the hug of death as well. With more than 15 million (official) [downloads](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pokemon-nintendo-business-implications-augmented-000000901.html) from 26 countries, the mobile game had to stop new players from signing up because the traffic had pushed its servers over the edge. Perhaps more noteworthy is the fact that it has managed to do the impossible. It’s managed to bring out hordes of nerds from underground basements to open-air gardens and parks, many of whom are just finding out that they are allergic to sunlight. It’s also managed to bring the stock of Nintendo up by 106% in the past two weeks. Nintendo owns 32% of The Pokemon Company, which is reportedly [making](http://www.wsj.com/articles/pokemon-chasing-investors-send-nintendo-shares-soaring-1468228206) an estimated $1.6 million per day in revenues from the game. For Nintendo, this couldn’t have come at a better time - the company’s profits fell by 61% last year due to weak sales of its console Wii U.

  

**Let The Games Begin! Again.**

The earnings season is here again. Which means newspapers don’t have to worry about filling empty space anymore. This earnings season was kicked off by three high profile names - Infosys, TCS and Reliance. As oil prices recover in the global market, petrochemical major Reliance [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/ril-q1-beats-estimates-profit4-grm-surges-to-361150bbl_7047161.html) a 4.4% increase in net profits beating expectations. The company’s currently busy preparing for a commercial launch of Reliance Jio, it’s foray into the telecom business. Moving over to names in the IT industry that reported earnings - When Donald Trump rants about foreigners stealing American jobs, this is part of what he’s unknowingly referring to. Both IT companies, TCS and Infosys are in the business of helping multinational corporations outsource their work and business is booming. But only for one of them. TCS [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tcs-q1-results-idINKCN0ZU15T) a better-than-expected 11% rise in net profit but dalal street had no love for the stock which remained flat. Perhaps due to fears over Brexit since the UK contributes 15% to the company’s revenue while the rest of Europe adds another 12%. On the other hand, while Infosys did post a 13% rise in profits, but it [lowered](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/infosys-posts-lacklustre-q1-result-slashes-outlook-2917009/) its predictions of the profit it might report throughout the rest of the year. Definitely no love for the stock which is down over 8%.

1410227590.0,6,0,19,"Original date of rollout: April 1, 2010

Contentious issues:

1)

* States: Demand for provision in constitution to compensate them for any losses they make under proposed tax regime.

* Reason: Past bad experience of compensation in central sales tax (cst) case.

* Cst case - UPA government said that compensation to states on account of cut in cst to be released only when states agree to rollout gst. 

* Outcome - NDA said dues of Rs. 34,000 crore to be given to state over period of 3 years.
* Problem: compensation is proposed for only 5 years. ""the constitution cannot be changed every now and then"". Besides, NDA confident that states would not make any loss under the gst as they would get to share revenue.

* Solution: Use of alternative legal framework that does not involve constitutional amendment. Possible that 14th finance commission may recommend mechanism.

2)

* States: Petroleum product to be kept out of gst.

* Reason: It comprises 26% of their revenue.

* Problem: a) It forms major input for all other industries. 

* b) Will result in cascading of taxes for all other sectors, increase in cost of production. 

* c) It will disrupt audit trail and cause revenue leakages.

* Solution: a) Include petroleum in gst but tax at rate of 0%.
* b) States continue to levy sales tax, value added tax on it.
* c) Centre retains right to impose excise duty.

3)

* States: Entry tax to be kept out of gst.
 
* Problem: a) Excluding so many taxes from gst will defeat purpose of making India a common market.

* b) Pushes up the revenue-neutral rate for government.

* Solution: States could levy additional state gst - within a band - to protect revenue.

1548813778.0,6,12,14,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

1410808354.0,6,105,36,"DECONSTRUCTION OF THE NORDIC MODEL

Most problems that India face now can be attributed to consequences of Nehruvian socialism that this country has adopted for about 45 years. I am from Kerala and here the Politics cannot be separated from communism and despite being an age old relic, it still refuses to die out.

Since the reforms that was carried out in 1991 most millennial Indians have largely rejected such archaic concepts focusing more on modernity. But in this context a new concept has largely caught the fancy of most new age Indians: The Nordic model. As such in my experience I see more people supporting Nordic model over communism currently in Kerala. 

In this slightly lengthy post, I will try to deconstruct the Nordic model from two angles.

1. Nordic viability in India
2. Efficacy of Nordic model

First a note on Nordic model. Nordic model or Nordic capitalism or Nordic social democracy refers to the economic and social models of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), which involves the combination of a free market economy with a welfare state. More or less implemented around the mid 60s, this is said to have promoted a sustainable state and economy in these countries. Calls have been made among policy makers in India, with special mention to Nobel prize winning welfare economist Amartya Sen, to implement reforms along the Nordic lines in India

NORDIC VIABILITY IN INDIA

Nordic Socialism: Indian proponents of Nordic model advocate establishing a state along the social democracy lines. But the truth is that Scandinavia isn't really all that socialist. Scandinavian countries have certain socialist characteristics such as high taxes and extensive welfare systems. However, these countries have relatively capitalistic markets. Scandinavian businesses are mostly free from regulation, nationalization and protectionism. Sweden, Denmark and Finland rank higher than US in in business freedom, monetary freedom, investment freedom, fiscal freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. Norway ranks higher than the US in trade freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. 

Source: http://www.heritage.org/index/explore

The overall point here is that Scandinavian countries have fairly capitalistic business environments. Until India, which has abysmal rankings in all these parameters, achieve free business environment and comparable income levels it should not consider a comparable welfare model.

 Economic calculation problem: First proposed by Ludwig von Mises, it describes the signalling function of prices. Prices of goods are signals to entrepreneurs to adequately allocate their resources. When economic planning is added to the mix, it distorts the market forces and prices. This in turn facilitates inefficient allocation of resources and wastage. In a macro scale this presents itself as inflation. Larger the economy, harder it becomes to ""plan"". Scandinavian nations are all small economies with homogeneous economic components and it would be relatively easier to centralize function there (But it has not been without its demerits, more on that below). India is one of the largest and the most diverse economy in the world in terms of the economic components involved. As such India is last candidate for any sort of planning. History has shown that most planning here has met with some sort of counterproductive unintended consequence and the inflation numbers here speaks for itself.

Bureaucracy and social trust: Scandinavian countries are characterized by high levels of social liberalism and trust. Research finds that high levels of social trust increase economic growth. According to one study, ""The size of the effect in most studies is such that 10 percentage points higher trust is associated with half a percentage point higher annual growth rate. In the Scandinavian countries, about 60 percent agree that most people can be trusted, which can be compared to the OECD average of about just 40 percent.

Source: http://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Govt-Size-and-Growth.pdf

There is also the case of the highly transparent nature of the bureaucracy in the Scandinavian nations. As with the trust worthy nature of the bureaucrats there, they can be trusted with governing functions of the state. Bureaucracy is India on the other hand is an absolute mess. India features almost at the bottom of the transparency index. As evidenced by the corruption, Bureaucrats here simply cannot be trusted with any action and would be best left free of bureaucratic control.

Source: http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2013/results/#myAnchor1

Taxation problem: Scandinavian nations are characterized by high levels of taxation on income. Although I will go into the problems of Nordic model below, it must be said that these countries grow in spite of high taxes, not because of them. Indeed, several studies which examine taxation across developed countries show that when other determinants of growth are accounted for, taxation seriously diminishes growth. At the same time it must be added that while these countries have high tax on incomes, the corporate levels are low. Corporate tax average of Scandinavian nations is about 25% compared to about 40% in USA. So it is possible that the corporate sector there is balancing the economy. Hence higher tax levels are not an option in India where industry and corporate sectors constitute only a marginal share of the overall economy.

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1699715

Economic history of Nordic nations: Most Scandianavian nations instituted the Nordic model in mid 1960s. Before this most of these countries reaped benefit from high growth facilitated by laissez faire policies and neutrality in the World Wars. Welfare system that you see now wouldn't have been possible had it not been for the surplus it had made during their laissez faire era. India on the other hand has no Laissez faire history. It is a country which is home to half of the world's poor. By instituting a welfare state, India would be incentivizing these poor souls to continue in their misery.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/9YhKdaE.png

Norway : Norway is an exception among Nordic nations itself. Oil was discovered in the North Sea in 1960 after which the country made its switch to welfare state. When liberals in US point to the per-capita GDP of Norway, they forget to mention that much of this is a result of big oil interests. Norway is the largest oil producer and exporter in all of Western Europe. Norway produces roughly 200 barrels of oil per person per year. That puts it at number 5 in the world for per capita oil production. In other words, Norway is successful despite its government, not because of its government. India is largely import dependent when it comes to oil and has very few proven oil reserves. It cannot bank on resource wealth to fund its welfare state.

EFFICACY OF THE NORDIC MODEL

In this portion, I will discuss the problems with Nordic model itself. Given below are series of comparisons he made between Scandinavian nations and USA under various parameters. While US itself is no paragon of capitalism. Over the years it has show relatively high levels of free markets which has slightly regressed in the recent years. The main difference between the American system and the Nordic Model is that America has a medium-size welfare state and the Nordic nations have large welfare states. That explains, at least in part, why the U.S. economy generally outperforms the Nordic Model. US stats were easily available online, so I took that. Give me a beak.

As seen in Figure below US has enjoyed a faster rate of growth.According to the OECD, the U.S. grew by an average of 3 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 3.3 percent between 1992 and 2006 (meaning average growth of 3.2 percent for 1981 to 2006). The Nordic nations, by contrast, grew by an average of 2.2 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 2.7 percent from 1992 to 2006(meaning average growth of 2.5 percent over the entire period). The IMF, meanwhile, reports that U.S. growth averaged 3.1 percent from 1981–2006 compared to an average of 2.6 percent for Nordic nations in the same period.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gpTtjiA.png

Figure below, measures of per capita GDP from the World Bank, the OECD, the IMF, and the CIA all show that Americans haveabout $6,000 of additional economic output per person, significantly more than $20,000 for each family of four.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/ilG5UVr.png

Although per capita GDP is an excellent measure of overall economic output relative to population, it does not necessarily measure living standards. Comparing U.S. and Nordic living standards requires numbers for disposable income. The OECD series for disposable income in the Figure below. According to a study using 2003 data, the average person in the US had more than $27,000 of disposable income, while the average person in Nordic nations Had disposable income of barely $14,300, less than 53 percentof the U.S. level. Even Norwegians, bolstered by oil wealth, had per capita disposable income of less than $16,800, barely 62 percent of the American level. Danes and Finns are at the bottom, with less than 50 percent of the disposable income of the average American. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/anuxd8j.png

Personal consumption: In 2005, the Danish Finance Ministry produced numbers comparing per capita private consumption in OECD nations. As seen in Figure below, the average person in Nordic nations has barely 51 percent as much private consumption as an average American. The Norwegians are the most prosperous, but even their private consumption is just 56 percent of U.S. levels. Both the Swedes and the Finns have less than 50 percent of the private consumption of average Americans. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/jIIqdoc.png

As expected by the nature of free markets Nordic countries lag US when it comes to per capita GDP growth

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gjBFuGG.png

Last but not least, defenders of the Nordic Model argue that the US suffers from greater levels of income inequality. Various measures of inequality, such as Gini coefficients, confirm that “wealthy” Americans earn a bigger share of the pie than Upperincome citizens in Nordic nations. But this data is incomplete without also looking at the size of the pie. As illustrated in Figure below, the poorest 10 percent of Americans have about the same level of income as the poorest 10 percent of Finns, Swedes, and Danes. Only in oil-rich Norway is there a noticeable gap (data for Iceland not available). What differentiates America from the Nordic nations is the income of everyone else. The rich, the middle class, and the working class in the US enjoy higher levels of income than their Nordic counterparts. If nations are being judged on the prosperity of their poorest citizens, then Nordic nations certainly are equal to the US. Indeed, they even have a slight advantage (though even that advantage might disappear if Nordic nations had US levels of immigration). But if nations are being judged on factors beyond just the well-being on the poorest segment of the population, then the US holds a clear edge.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/lDeXvnX.png

CONCLUSION

Excessive government diminishes growth. And although the Nordic countries’ relatively free markets mitigate the damage caused by high taxes and high spending, the burden of government is hindering economic performance. The Nordic Model is preferable to the Continental or Corporatist Model of nations such as France and Germany, which combines welfare state policies and interventionism. When I was researching this , Google news showed that Sweden plans to scale back it welfare state due to pressure. 

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/swedish-elections-cracks-showing-nordic-model

These AAP Kejriwal types are constantly backing a welfare state. I am not against AP or anything, if they can just fix their economic policies, I'll be all for them. Milton Friedman famously said that you cannot have a Welfare state and open borders. Sweden seems to learning that lesson. In India's case Free markets is the best option.

Now, democracy is a political system which ensures decisions by discussion and debate, but the discussion and debate must be conducted honestly and objectively and decisions must be arrived at on merits without being influenced or actuated by any extraneous considerations. On first impression, it would appear that any attempt on the part of anyone to finance a political party is likely to contaminate the very springs of democracy. Democracy would be vitiated if results are to be arrived at not on their merits, but because money played a part in the bringing about of those decisions. The form and trappings of democracy may continue, but the spirit underlying democratic institutions will disappear. History of democracy has proved that in other countries democracy has been smothered by big business and money bags playing an important part in the working of democratic institutions and it is the duty not only of politicians, not only of citizens, but even of a Court of law, to the extent that it has got the power, to prevent any influence being exercised upon the voter which is an improper influence or which may be looked at from any point of view as a corrupt influence. The very basis of democracy is the voter and when in India we are dealing with adult suffrage it is even more important than elsewhere that not only the integrity of the representative who is ultimately elected to Parliament is safeguarded, but that the integrity of the voter is also safeguarded, and it may be said that it is difficult to accept the position that the integrity of the voter and of the representative is safeguarded if large industrial concerns are permitted to contribute to political funds to bring about a particular result.",,An excellent piece on funding of [P]olitical parties which seems source of all evil (read failing) of a democracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6970p6/an_excellent_piece_on_funding_of_political/

*“Thinking of giving up on entrepreneurship and do a simple job. Will take decision by this weekend. What’s your advise?”* - Former CEO of Housing.com, Rahul Yadav, often called the bad boy of Indian startups, on Facebook [after](http://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/ex-ceo-of-housing-rahul-yadav-blames-bureaucrats-for-flop-venture/story-Rs0G3s3bmEtropolV8udpL.html) the failure of his latest venture, Intelligent Interfaces. You know the situation is desperate when the guy is asking for career advice from people on Facebook. Comments on his profile have already called him the Rakhi Sawant/Kim Kardashian of startups.

**Apple’s New China Is India**

When Steve Jobs, ex-hippie and the founder of Apple, visited India in the 1970s, he wore a lungi and [roamed](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/what-steve-jobs-did-in-india-35-years-ago-225246) barefoot. Until, of course, the Indian national disease of diarrhea cut his trip short and sent him back to the US. Fortunately for all of us, when Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple, visited India last week his attire did not include a lungi and he probably drank bottled water, as is tradition for all foreign tourists in India. In between wild Bollywood parties at SRK’s house and IPL matches in Kanpur, Tim [announced](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-tim-cook-samples-bollywood-cricket-in-bid-to-woo-india-1463822223) a startup accelerator in Bengaluru and the opening of two new offices including one in Hyderabad. It wasn’t all play and no work - Tim met with businessmen like the CEOs of ICICI Bank, Vodafone India, TCS and heads of state like Prime Minister Modi, the Telangana CM and many more. But why India and why now? After reporting the first quarterly decline in sales that was largely caused due to slowing growth in China, Apple is now searching for something other than China to fuel growth for the coming decade. And Apple’s next China might just be India. Tim termed his visit to India as ‘fantastic’ but then again, he also ran into Alia Bhatt. So it’s entirely possible that his statements were laced with sarcasm.  

**The One With Trump, Brexit and India**

Britain, the former colonial master of India and more countries than you can even name, is going through an independence movement of its own. Currently, the country is a part of the European Union, a political and economic union of 28 countries in Europe. In a public vote to be held on June 23rd, Britishers will decide if the nation will stay in the European Union or get out of the European Union. All of that may be Britain’s headache but a new report out of SBI [suggests](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-brexit-can-open-up-opportunities-for-india-sbi-research-report-2212552) that even though a Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) could be terrible for Europe, it could turn out to be hugely beneficial for India since Indian companies will no longer need to follow complex trade agreements while dealing with Britain. Likewise, a former US Diplomat says a Trump presidency in the US, while [terrible](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/if-donald-trump-becomes-us-president-india-may-gain-at-chinas-expense-heres-why/articleshow/52380459.cms) for China and Pakistan (...not to mention Mexico) might actually turn out to be great for India as ~~Donald Trump~~ Dear Leader’s foreign policies are likely to shift the balance of power in Asia in favour of India. The word to describe what you’re feeling right now is schadenfreude - taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Trust me, *I know words. I have the best [words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T-Eo0j092Q)*

**The Banking Bloodbath**

With the whole bad loans crisis being shoved in everyone’s faces, it’s no surprise that banks are feeling the heat. Saddled with a ton of losses caused by increasing net non-performing assets (the fancy term for bad loans), conditions are becoming dire. A host of smaller banks reported earnings last week and it’s not good. If you have a phobia of falling bank profits, turn away now and seek professional help because it’s about to get gruesome. Alright, [here](http://www.livemint.com/Money/1MpJ5uNbQXhacOWKTo3PWJ/PSU-banks-shares-fall-after-weak-earnings.html) we go: Dena Bank reported a loss of ₹326 crore, Allahabad Bank reported a loss of ₹581 crore, Central Bank of India reported a loss of ₹898 crore, UCO Bank reported a loss of ₹1,715 crore and Syndicate Bank [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/syndicate-bank-q4-loss-at-rs-2158cr-provisions-jump-3-fold_6677621.html) a loss of ₹2,158 crore. Going for the silver medal is Bank of Baroda with a loss of ₹3,230 crore, the second highest loss in the history of Indian banking. And now, for the gold medal, the worst loss in the history of Indian banking ever was reported at a record-breaking ₹5,367 crore by *drumroll* Punjab National Bank. It feels good to have found the rock-bottom at last. At least now, there is nowhere to go but up. That’s what investors in bank stocks are saying to themselves so they can sleep well at night. Let’s hope for their sake that we don’t find a new bottom in the next quarter.

**|| || || > | | | | | |**

So you might’ve heard: The banking industry is in a bit of a tight spot. There haven’t been any bankruptcies (phew) yet. But there’s blood on the streets. And the only way to patch the wound is to stick together in times of trouble. State Bank of India, one of the largest banks in India, [proposed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-bank-of-india-says-no-talks-on-merging-with-any-other-lenders-1408323) a plan to stick together and merge with its 5 associate banks: State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore plus the newly created Bharatiya Mahila Bank. If merged, the combined bank will become a banking behemoth with 50 crore customers. And behemoths don’t bleed easy. Taking cue, the government is also urging UCO Bank, Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank (all of whom have reported losses) to find themselves a relatively well off bank and merge their losses away. Playing the merger game is tricky business. You don’t want your merger to be like Romeo and Juliet. Sure, they made history but they both died in the end. You want your merger to be like Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. One that can live happily ever after.

* Chalk this one up to the Romeo and Juliet category of mergers - the Chairman and Managing Director of Air India, Mr. Lohani has [blamed](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/air-india-merger-led-to-a-mess-ashwani-lohani/article8621785.ece) the distraught airline’s debt and losses on the 2011 merger of Air India and Indian Airlines. Mr. Lohani, who took over the basket case of an airliner just last year, seems to have lost all hope as he stated that Air India has a bureaucracy bigger than even the Indian Railways, the mother-load of all bureaucracies.

* After the rise of Flipkart and the likes, everyone and their mother is getting in on the ecommerce game. The Tatas are now [launching](https://inc42.com/flash-feed/tata-group-enter-ecommerce-space-launch-cliq/) CliQ, an online retailer selling apparel, electronics, footwear and more from over 80 brands. This comes right after Arvind Ltd. (the Indian partner of brands like Arrow, Lee, Wrangler etc.) launched its ecommerce play, NNNow.com (I didn’t have a seizure, that’s the actual name). This also comes months after the Reliance Group launched ajio.com and the Aditya Birla Group launched abof.com.

* Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka is making some serious coin - Sikka, who has boosted all the numbers that matter since taking over in 2014, will be [paid](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/vishal-sikka-kicks-in-big-salary-spikes-at-infosys/articleshow/52287712.cms) ₹74 crore including stock options this year, which works out to 116 times the median salary of Infosys employees. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, however has in the past suggested that the highest salary paid in a company shouldn’t be more than 25 times the lowest salary paid in the company.

* Vijay Mallya, who has indirectly paid the salaries of thousands of journalists around the world along with Donald Trump, is scared. He’s scared that Indians will come after him with pitchforks if he ever returns from the UK. Accordingly, Mallya [says](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/vijay-mallya-fugitive-businessman-consider-india-return-if-safety-freedom-assured-1560279) he’ll only return if his safety and freedom is assured. GOI’s formal request to the British government to extradite Mallya was declined. More problems to boot: A ₹2.4 crore dividend payable to Mallya from United Breweries was withheld.

They say there’s no use digging up old corpses. And declassifying old government records can sometimes certainly feel like digging up old corpses. Well, this time the government might have found a zombie. After releasing old records relating to the Azad Hind Bank, founded by Subhash Chandra Bose, many borrowers have [approached](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-16/news/73126343_1_currency-notes-bank-notes-legal-tender) the finance ministry asking the government to recognize the currency issued by the Azad Hind Bank in 1944 as legal tender, so they can use it to repay existing loans. In a country of more than a billion people, there’s potential for more than a billion bizarre stories. And this is just one. 

$1 billion is the number of the week for Apple. $1 billion is the amount that Warren Buffett, the billionaire that has traditionally and even proudly shunned technology, has [invested](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21699139-meaning-two-odd-and-connected-investments-1-billion-stakes-menu) in Apple shares over the last quarter. $1 billion is also the amount that Apple invested in Didi, not the Bengali politician, but Uber’s competitor in China. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s girlfriend, reportedly owns shares of Apple, which makes her an investor in Didi. That’s got to make for some very awkward pillow talk.

1482090647.0,6,1,3,"I am a 22 years old NRI in the diamonds business in Thailand. I have a BBA in Finance from a top university in Thailand. I chose to join my family business and decided against an MBA  (partly because I cannot afford it). We are a middle-class family and I am not certain about the future of the diamonds business. 

I am planning to learn programming/web development and Spanish as a hobby and will try to work as a freelancer along with working in the family business. In case the business doesn't work out, I would love to shift to India. 

Do you guys think there is a possibility of finding a good job in India (preferably Mumbai) considering my experience of management, sales, programming and a two foreign languages (Thai and Spanish) along with Hindi?",,Does this plan sound reasonable?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5izw84/does_this_plan_sound_reasonable/
1432569255.0,6,17,19,"I have been planning to write about this for some time now. I was associated with MBA preparation industry for a long time and wanted to write about how something good like RTI ended up spoiling the selection process at IIMs.

Background - Till few years ago, anyone could dream to be in IIMs, even if you have bad marks in school and college. Get a good percentile and if you show great acumen in the interviews, there is a good chance you will get selected. I know of people who scored ~50% in graduation and could get through top IIMs. 

Was the selection process subjective - Yes

Then RTIs came into picture and people started asking for details on selection and objectifying the criteria. I have to mention it here that that the authorities at IIMs have the pleasure of plenty. It is a rejection process than a selection process. So, rather than instituting a better process they added qualification criterion (e.g. Marks in Xth, XIIth, Grad etc) and only if you clear that, you get shortlisted for an interview. So now, in the past few years, students who have performed exceptionally well in academics throughout their life can only dare to apply to IIMs (no pun intended :p).

It is my personal view that when you are creating Business managers, curriculum marks are hardly an indicator. Skills like Relationships, People Management, Creativity, Street smartness are missing in the people who have been academic all their lives. They can be really great as number crunchers and a domain like Finance suits them well. 
Hence in the past few years, b-schools have been creating degree holders, not business managers.

So, I think there are 2 unintended consequences of this - 

1) RTI in spite of being a good tool, ended up making lot of deserving people miss the bus, of course helped by the laziness of the selection authorities.

2) The folks who are smart, are starting up.

I am not enjoying working in my family business as much and I would love to shift back to Mumbai (love that city!).

**2020: Double the Coal, Double the Asthma**

Tesla Motors of the United States just launched the Model 3 electric car that can run entirely on solar power, reducing any climate effects since it doesn’t need gasoline. Piyush Goyal of the Indian Power and Coal Ministry, on the other hand, just assured everyone that India will indeed [double] (http://profit.ndtv.com/news/commodities/article-india-to-rely-on-state-miners-to-meet-coal-target-piyush-goyal-1291421) its coal production by 2020, increasing every imaginable climate effect. So the government wants to increase coal production to 1.5 billion tonnes by 2020. State-owned Coal India ([COALINDIA](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ACOALINDIA&ei=vtABV7DnAtbajAGNr57QBQ)), India’s largest coal mining company, is already on track to increase its own production to 1 billion tonnes by 2020. The private sector was expected to pick up the tab for the remaining half a billion tonnes. But since the private sector companies are strapped for cash and can’t increase coal production to meet the target, the coal minister is pushing for other state-owned companies like NTPC ([NTPC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ANTPC&ei=XtEBV7n2CoSA2AaLz7vwCA)), National Aluminium Co ([NATIONALUM](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ANATIONALUM&ei=ndEBV6GTBISe2AbWvIy4AQ)) to step up their coal production so the government can meet that target. “Renewables? Climate change? Pollution? Asthma? What do those words even mean?” - Piyush Goyal (paraphrased).

([ITC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AITC&ei=rNEBV-GJHMP02AbI5KiABQ)) through the Tobacco Institute of India have shut down all cigarette manufacturing facilities since [April 1st](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-itc-not-ready-to-print-bigger-health-warnings-on-cigarette-packs-factories-to-remain-shut-2197282). The stated reason for this is because of the ‘ambiguity’ over the size of pictorial health warnings on cigarette packages. Every cigarette packet is mandated by law to have horrible pictures of Satan’s lungs over them to discourage smoking. While a parliamentary committee had recommended the size of those pictures to be 50% of the packaging, the health ministry had ordered for the figure to be 85%. Not knowing which figure to follow, the cigarette manufacturers have decided to just shut down all operations and take daily losses of ₹350 crore. The theory behind the size of the pictures being - larger the picture, lesser the smoking. If you listen hard, you can almost hear the patron saint of anti-smoking ads, Mukesh turning in his grave thinking of what would’ve been if only the 85% sized pictures had come in his lifetime.

**Buybacks and Dividends to the Rescue!**

The Indian football team can’t set goals to win the FIFA World Cup 2018, unfortunately that’s just not realistic. And one of the basic rules of setting goals is that they should be realistically achievable. But somebody in the government never got that memo. After five consecutive years of failing to achieve targets of money raised through disinvestment, the government still set an all-time record [high](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/PAYP49n1pV885tWIPO7d3J/Disinvestment-scorecard-Govt-a-to-miss-target-16th-tim.html) target for this year. So it shouldn’t exactly be a surprise when it misses targets this year as well, which will be the 16th time in 25 years now. But unrealistic targets also lead to desperate actions to fulfill those targets. In this case, the government is looking at buybacks and special [dividends](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Govt-banks-on-unlisted-PSUs-to-mop-up-Rs-5k-cr-this-week/articleshow/51577307.cms) from unlisted state-owned companies like Hindustan Aeronautics and others. The extra cash in those companies will now be used to buy shares back from the government and declare special dividends amounting to almost ₹5,000 crore to help the government meet targets this year. Who wants to bet we’ll still miss targets this year and set an even higher target for next year?

**BJP’s Beef Ban Backfires**

(pause for reader to appreciate that alliteration) As a part of the BJP’s beef ban that was introduced in BJP-ruled states last year, it is prohibited to sell your cattle for slaughter. For people living in cities drinking Starbucks coffee, that’s hardly a problem since they don’t really own a lot of cattle. But for farmers living in villages drinking unfiltered water, that’s a huge [problem](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-beef-idINKCN0WU1UQ). If the rains don’t show up for a particular year, the crops fail and the farmer sells his cattle to feed his family. And when the rains do show up the next year, the crops blossom and the farmer buys the cattle back. But the beef ban just threw a wrench in this cycle by making it harder for people to sell their cows. Cattle prices have fallen across the country, by almost 40 to 60 percent in one district of Maharashtra and India’s meat exports have dropped 13%. This comes at a time when the government is trying very hard to appease farmers in a bid to win state elections later this year.

**For Sale: Tata Steel UK, Condition: Slightly Used**

On second thoughts, slightly used might not be the correct way of describing Tata Steel’s UK business. ‘Abused by the Chinese’ might be more accurate. Tata Steel ([TATASTEEL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATATASTEEL&ei=3NEBV-H3IceJ2AbIrarYCw)) entered the UK Steel market by acquiring Corus, a company that was three times bigger than itself for $8.1 billion (₹53,654 crore) in 2007. Fast forward to two months ago, it declared a [loss](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/tata-steel-reports-third-quarter-loss-chinese-imports) of £68 million (₹641 crore) after suffering from cheap Chinese imports, high energy costs and weak demand. Last week, Tata Steel announced that it was putting up its entire UK business on the [auction](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot) block. The problem is: no one’s bidding. The UK government is even debating on just nationalizing the whole business to prevent mass layoffs and to protect what is an important part of the British economy. Of course, that’ll only be temporary nationalization until suitable buyers from the private sector can be found. Otherwise, it’ll be socialism (gasp).

**100% FDI in E-commerce *T&C Apply**

Millions of family-owned corner stores across India have moaned and complained since forever against e-commerce companies taking their customers away. And with Amazon gaining a foothold and Alibaba planning an Indian expansion, the e-commerce field in India is increasingly being dominated by foreign companies. The corner store guys were having none of this and filed a lawsuit saying this was illegal since foreign companies aren’t exactly allowed to set up retail operations in India. After years of uncertainty, we finally have a ruling on this - foreign companies are now legally allowed to set up e-commerce operations in India, but terms and conditions [apply](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec51a45e-f5be-11e5-9afe-dd2472ea263d.html#axzz44oZbeUBy) (don’t they always?). These companies can’t sell directly to customers, but can only connect buyers and sellers. No single seller can account for more than 25% of sales. And these companies can not set prices themselves to offer discounts, as many do now to attract customers. Buy that smartphone for cheap while you can, the days of deep discounts may end before you know it.

**Return Of The Avengers**

Whoever says Hollywood’s superhero movies are unrealistic? The Avengers are actually real. Hollywood’s Avengers was a group of superheroes saving the universe by blowing stuff up. In reality, the Avengers are a group of guys that just blow stuff up for no real reason. The Niger Delta Avengers militant group has been [blowing](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/07/oil-hovers-near-8-month-highs-on-us-inventory-draw.html) up oil wells in Nigeria and has rejected any peace talks with the government. After dropping to dangerous lows of $20, crude oil prices have bounced back and recently crossed the $50 mark. Much of the reason for this rise is simply the forces of supply and demand reacting to each other in a free market. But one of the reasons it touched $50 last week was the Avengers sabotaging oil wells. A lot of investors betting on the resurgence of oil can’t say this out loud, but thank god for terrorist Avengers. However, not everybody is celebrating the return of oil. In the latest policy review, the RBI (which kept interest rates untouched last week), [cited](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/black-gold-a-headache-not-only-for-modi-but-for-raghuram-rajan-too/articleshow/52634156.cms) rising oil prices as a risk. Because when oil prices go up, inflation goes up as well. Personally, I’m just sad that budget cuts forced the Avengers to opt for simple dynamite instead of nuclear-powered Mach-5 flying suits.

**Black Problems**

India has a huge second economy that deals with black money. That’s news to nobody. But a new study has [pegged](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/new-study-pegs-black-money-in-india-at-rs-30-lakh-crore/story/233395.html) the size of that black economy at an astounding 20% of GDP or over ₹30 lakh crore (that’s 3 followed by 13 zeroes). And that just happens to be bigger than the overall economic size of countries like Thailand or Argentina. While the size of India’s black economy expanded rapidly during the 70s and 80s, it has been gradually declining since then. Today, most of this money is locked up in physical assets like real estate or gold. Due to obvious reasons, there are no official figures but experts say that as much as 30% of India’s real estate sector is funded by black money. Really, only in economics can you root for the supremacy of white over black and not be called a ~~Donald Trump supporter~~ racist.

**The Curious Case Of Missing GDP**

How does a 7.9% growth in GDP sound to you? If you ask the average joe on the streets, he won’t know what is what. But if you ask the fairly well-read joe on the streets, he’ll tell you that a 7.9% growth rate is amazing. But what about a 3.9% growth in GDP? Now, that’s bad. Official numbers released last week say that India’s GDP in the March quarter grew by 7.9%. But wait, there’s more. The accuracy of those numbers has been [called](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/kvvDHfbryOQjvu2l16UcEI/Discrepancies-drive-GDP-growth.html) into question. When you break GDP down into its components, sometimes the data doesn’t add up. It’s life. Sometimes, things just don’t add up. So this gap is then plugged by calling the missing portion as a ‘discrepancy’. As long as this discrepancy doesn’t get too big, all is well. But the amount of discrepancy in the latest numbers has shot up by over 350%. And if you remove the amount put under ‘discrepancy’, GDP growth rate falls from 7.9% to 3.9%. Faking GDP numbers? Come on guys, that’s not our job. That’s China’s [job](http://fortune.com/2015/12/14/china-fake-economic-data/).


**Economic Story Because Export and Import**

Nuclear weapons are serious business. Emphasis on serious rather than business. Although a handful of companies do make money off the nuclear power business. When sensitive nuclear technology falls in the wrong hands, you have rogue nations like North Korea and when it falls in the right hands... well, there really aren’t any right hands for nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a group of 48-countries that controls the export and import of goods that can be used to make a nuclear weapon. The NSG does this to ensure that nuclear technology doesn’t fall in the wrong hands. But India is not one of its 48 members. One of the reasons we are not invited to parties thrown by the NSG is because we have nuclear weapons but haven’t signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is an international agreement designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. This is a sore point with a lot of countries like China who are against India joining the NSG. However, being being friends with the United States, the world’s superpower does come with a lot of benefits. A US-led push to include India in the NSG is [picking](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-nuclear-idUSKCN0YV13Z) up steam as nations like South Africa and Turkey are coming around to supporting India’s bid for a membership. Here’s the irony - the only reason the NSG even exists as an international group, is because India tested nuclear weapons in the 70s and that rustled some jimmies in the international community.

Earlier this year, the Indian government once again tried to get the famed Kohinoor diamond back from the UK and failed. Citing that it would set an “unworkable precedent”, UK Prime Minister David Cameron [refused](http://www.newsweek.com/kohinoor-diamond-india-colonialism-449951) to return the stone, which has been claimed by the governments of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan at various points as well. That didn’t pan out quite well. But how do 200 statues and sculptures sound instead of 1 big fat diamond? The US  is [returning](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/07/us/stolen-artifacts-returned-india/) more than 200 artifacts that were stolen and smuggled out and eventually just ended up in the hands of the US government.

The government has, for the first time in history, [declared](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/03/india-will-have-surplus-power-for-the-first-time-ever-report) that it will not have a shortage of electricity this year.

**Pip Pip, Guv’nah!**

It’s here, and it’s real. The referendum to decide Britain’s fate took place last week, and a lot of things have hit the fan since then. It’s time for the Brits to wake up and smell the tea. With a 52% share of the vote, the Brexit camp won, which means the UK will now [leave](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/17/11963668/brexit-uk-eu-explained) the EU. It won’t happen next week, or next month - they now need to go through a complex procedure that can potentially take about 2 years to complete before officially becoming EU-free. They need to negotiate the terms of the exit with the EU as well as sort out some internal affairs that had been managed by the EU until now. The EU which accounts for 1/4th of global economy is also India’s single largest export market. To ELI5 the effect this will have on India - previously, Indian companies had to satisfy only one rule in order to sell products everywhere in Europe. But now, they will have to satisfy one rule in order to sell products in the UK, and another rule in order to sell products everywhere else in Europe. Nevertheless, the headline news here is that most of UK just went, “Farewell, European Union!”. Or more accurately, as the Brits would say, “Cheerio, buggers!”. 



**You Get To Exit, And You Get To Exit, Everybody Gets to Exit**

There are exits and then there are exits. But it all started with the Rexit (Rajan exiting the RBI). Now coincidentally, we’ve got an exodus of people in business and economics leaving their positions. YC Deveshwar, who’s been for 20 years the head of ITC, the billion dollar cigarettes-to-hotels firm is [leaving](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/uhmto3w6LYTfdGcXfcdjLN/Deveshwar-to-lead-ITC-as-nonexecutive-chairman-after-term-e.html) next year. SK Roy, the head of LIC, the state-run insurance company that is the single biggest domestic investor in the markets today just [tendered](http://www.firstpost.com/business/lic-chairman-s-k-roy-another-upa-appointee-resigns-before-his-5-year-term-2851360.html) his resignation as well. Roy was appointed for a 5-year term under the Manmohan Singh government. His term still has 2 years remaining but he’s calling it quits now. Can you guess the name of someone else who was also appointed under the Singh government and who also recently surprised everyone by the news of his exit? Alright, alright.. I’m sorry, I’ll move on. And now for some international resignations. Nikesh Arora, celebrity investor and ex-Google exec who was being groomed to be the next CEO of SoftBank also [resigned](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-can-t-be-ceo-in-waiting-softbank-s-nikesh-arora-explains-sudden-resignation-2226223) after they told him that founder and current CEO, Masayoshi wanted to be CEO for 5-10 more years. Kids these days, I tell you, so impatient. 48-year-old Nikesh Arora is currently busy coming to terms with the fact that he just left behind a pay package of $73 million a year.

**A ménage à trois**

A merger is when two or more companies come together to become one. Usually, mergers that are in the news refer to just two companies coming together. The *or more* part is rarely invoked. But this time, we have a rare case of merger with HDFC Life, Max Life Insurance and Max Financial Services [going](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/MJ5YsT8RS330FJhTDYJJZM/Boards-of-HDFC-Standard-Life-Max-Financial-to-meet-to-discu.html) for a threesome of mergers. Here’s how it’ll work: Max Life Insurance, the fourth-largest private insurer, will merge with parent company, Max Financial Services which will then merge with HDFC Life, the third-largest private insurer. Together, they will combine to become India’s largest private insurer. Every merger has a story behind it, albeit not always an exciting one, it’s still business and not Dan Brown. But our story begins 13.8 billion years ago with the big bang. We had some dinosaurs. Then some other stuff happened. And then in the late 1990s, India allowed private insurance companies to compete in the market which was dominated by the state-run Life Insurance Corporation. It should’ve spelled bad news for LIC but it still emerged as the winner in the competition as even today, the insurance industry is dominated by LIC. It’s no joke to compete against LIC which sells insurance policies that are basically guaranteed by the government. So you need to join forces and make allies if you want to take on the ring-leader that is LIC. And this three-way merger is only an effort to join forces and make allies.

**Funding For A Fund Of Funds That Funds Startups**

A significant part of this series always ends up being about the government even though it is supposed to be about the economy. Well, that’s because a significant part of our economy is controlled by the government through state-owned corporations and legislative policies. But the government’s influence on the economy is gradually declining because of policies like disinvestment, where the government gradually privatizes state-owned corporations. But sometimes, you just have to invest to spur growth. The government [approved](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/establishment-of-fund-of-funds-for-funding-support-to-start-ups-116062200723_1.html) a ₹10,000 crore fund that will be managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India, who will use the money to invest in funds that invest in startups. With this, the government isn’t trying to encourage the creation of Indian Zuckerbergs and Gates’ - it’s trying to encourage the creation of Indian jobs (with the lowercase j). More specifically, the fund is expected to create 18 lakh jobs. 18 lakh jobs? That’s enough to feed 18 lakh poor families. Either that, or about 18 #Urbanpoors.

1430021832.0,6,119,153,"There is this girl I know. I initially befriended her, then did some business with her, and eventually convinced her into agreeing to live with me.

Then for 200 days, I raped her. I brainwashed her, I taught her what to think, and I raped her some more.

But I also fed her, took care of her medical expenses, and introduced her to Netflix - something she'd have never experienced the joy of if she wasn't my captive. 

After about 200 days, it was becoming difficult for me to keep hold of her. My finances were in ruin due to other issues so I decided to free her. I gave her the freedom to leave and patted myself on the back for freeing her.

Meanwhile, during her time as my sex-slave, she developed a Stockholm syndrome - a part of her had fallen in love with me and started to look up to me, glorify me, and imitate me.  

However, since I set her free, she hasn't been able to do well. She's not been able to find a job, not been able to create any savings, has a dysfunctional thought process, cannot execute things properly. 

But  it has been 60 days since I set her free. If she can't get her things in order in such a long time, how can anyone blame my 200 days of rape for it? 

I mean if she can't get her house in order even after 60 days, its completely her fault. A large part of her even agrees with me on this.

However, there is this small part of her brain that keeps talking about how she has PTSD from my rape. I keep telling her that this is a deluded fascist part of her brain that is making up fiction about how it could have been if I had not raped her. I mean duh, she'd have never heard of Netflix. Besides, everyone else was raping too so its not really my fault.

In any case, this fascist part of her brain talks about justice and vengeance against me for my rape. But I prefer to ignore and not talk about those old days. Sometimes I even tell her that the rape was good for her. I suggest that its best we ignore the past and build on our special relationship and continue to work together for a better future for the both of us. She agrees with me for the most part except when her fascist mindset kicks in.

> RBI after demonetisation

>> For argument’s sake, even if we accept that the demonetisation was not in the best interest of the Indian economy, could Patel have prevented this? Section 26(2) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, says that on recommendation of RBI’s central board, the government may, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that with effect from a date specified in the notification, any series of banknotes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender. And, Section 7 of the Act says, “The central government may from time to time give such directions to the Bank as it may, after consultation with the Governor of the Bank, consider necessary in the public interest.” So, the government’s advice to RBI on demonetisation is in accordance with the Act, which also permits the government to supersede the central bank if it believes RBI has failed to carry out its obligations.

It has always been this way, we had a media friendly governor but RBI has only had a semblance of independence and the govt has not tried to force any rate cuts, which still speaks volumes. The governor is still allowed to criticize policies (like waivers) and is doing his job on NPAs. I strictly urge people not to let out their disappointment of Rajan not getting a second term on the institution and current governor.

I do not really know much about this so I'd rather not opine and let someone with more knowledge of the bill rather than cursory read of articles explain in detail how it makes things worse than they are.

> He is making the 0.001% at the top above law, almost god-like. This includes the business tycoons, senior most officials in the government, Ministers

This reads more like political statement without any subtantiation, and the response to it will be more based on personal perception of whoever is discussing. And as psychology tells us, our genuine perception can be the way we want it to be, based on our biases. Our minds work to confirm our worldview, not refute it.

What I know is that this country has always had that culture, in fact, most collectivist cultures do. Indian economy has always had heavy influence of the incumbent traditional business-houses. The public policy has always worked in a way to retain the incumbents rather than provide competition.

> senior most officials in the government, Ministers

And I suppose this is referring to the ordinance proposed by the Raje govt in Rajasthan? The senior BJP leadership stated they don't support it and afaik, even indicated that they'd take action against Raje were she to move forward with this. There were [voices against this in BJP](https://www.oneindia.com/india/not-only-opposition-some-bjp-leaders-also-against-rajasthan-govt-s-draconian-ordinance-2567599.html) itself and they've responded to the feedback.

What motivated me to post this? I'm a regular citizen who goes about his life in a distinctively apolitical fashion. I've enjoyed countless discussions here on this forum but I've sort of become apathetic, and I don't see the doom out in real life.

What are my genuine gripes with the Modi government? The big-brother like approach and linking everything to Aadhaar in the name of ""anti-black money"" movement, creating a surveillance state.

Hello /r/India,

In this edition of Last Week in Indian Parliament, we talk about the great ‘Pillar Fight’; quorum of the house and the absence of it; and how Rajya Sabha turned into a nukkad Ganpati Utsav culture day. 

I also wanted to write about: ""The Enforcement of Security Interest and (*takes a deep breath*) Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions (AMENDMENT) Bill, 2016 to amend the Securitisation and (*takes another deep breath*) Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 a.k.a the SARFAESI Act""

But then I realized it requires a whole new post.

So let's get right into it!

___

#“Hon’ble Members…”

#“Absent, Madam.”
___

The Budget session adjourned sine-dine on Friday for Rajya Sabha and on Wednesday for Lok Sabha. I can’t even count how many times during this session I heard the quorum bell ringing shrill, begging the members to come inside the house and let the business continue.

For the uninitiated, quorum is the minimum number of members that have to be present for the business in the house to be conducted. Under article 100(3) of the Constitution, for both houses of Parliament and State Assemblies, the quorum is one-tenth of the total strength of the house. So basically, in Lok Sabha, 53 members need to be present in order to let the house function.

Here’s the funny thing though, the quorum is considered only if a member present in the house brings it to the notice of the speaker. There is a certain ‘young’ Congress MP who can be spotted constantly counting the number of members present (I can’t name this person, for obvious reasons). The moment he sees that the members are below 53, he screams, “MADAMMMM! QUORUMMMM!?” 

Then he sits back with a smirk on his face as the speaker sighs, halts the business and the quorum bell rings.

**Fun fact**: There are two different sounding (and extremely shrill) quorum bells for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. They can be heard throughout the premises and all conversations are cut short. There are separate sounding bells for division of the house calls too. The members are supposed to rush into the house when these bells ring. Super irritating, if you ask me. If it were upto me, I would use the following as quorum bells:

[Lok Sabha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W2jONIjrM0)

[Rajya Sabha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg)

**Fun Fact 2:** The Quorum bell was rung when the Finance Bill and Aadhaar Bill were being considered. It was rung multiple times when the debate on Water Crisis was underway. Gives you an idea about the state of affairs.

**Why was the Lok Sabha adjourned early?**

Because the government didn’t seem to have any legislative business left. The Lok Sabha was supposed to continue till May 13, but was shut down on May 11. 

After the Uttarakhand Appropriation bill was passed, there was nothing left to do. So, as an afterthought, the discussion on drought and water crisis continued for two days. Since the session is coinciding with five state elections, a lot of members were absent from the house. I don’t recall AIADMK MPs participating even in a single debate this session. So basically, maintaining quorum was becoming a big issue and probably that’s why they decided to adjourn Lok Sabha early.

#Pillar Fight!
___

There has been a silent battle raging between our Judiciary, Legislature and Executive. In the past one month, there are many seemingly disconnected events that happened, but if you look closer you will see a tiny silk thread running through them all. Last week, during a debate on Uttarakhand appropriating bill, the Pillar Fight came to the forefront. The story is quite convoluted, so hold on to your [tin-foil hats](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/69852/3449330-tumblr_loq5o7rd4n1qzl8s1o1_400.gif)!

**The Battle of Uttarakhand**

The Uttarakhand ‘crisis’ came to a conclusion last week after Harish Rawat won the floor test, got on to his horse and [galloped away into the sunset](https://67.media.tumblr.com/ff9fd687b5bb1a3256eef3428074b7bb/tumblr_nytqw4xu7G1u9i37so1_400.gif). The floor test was ordered by the Supreme Court and it was to take place without the speaker of the 70 member assembly conducting it. The whole hand-raising ceremony was recorded and the video was sent to SC for verification. News Channels were showing Rawat praying to god almighty for saving his seat and, in the process, getting a lot of sympathy from his voters.

(**PERSONAL POLITICAL COMMENT:** I won’t be surprised if, come February, he goes around the state, addressing election rallies and screaming “MODI TRIED TO CONQUER US! BUT WE FRIKKIN WON!!” The ‘outsider invaded our land’ pitch can be quite compelling. Remember Independence Day? No no, not the Indian Freedom Struggle, I was talking about the movie where aliens attack and humans win and then everyone makes out in the end and are all happy and shit. Same thing. So, well done BJP!)


**Uttarakhand Appropriation Bill, 2016** 

>“Speaker is the roxxx. He/she is Supreme”

>~ Indian National Congress


Before the crucial floor test happened on Tuesday, the government of the day seemed to be in a weird sort of hurry to get the state’s budget passed in Parliament on Monday. I’m yet to figure out why but the Finance Minister, in his opening statement, said that this was being passed so that the state can continue with its expenditure for the next four months. He said, if the budget is not passed by the Assembly, the state won’t be allowed to spend any money.

[Jaitley Logic](http://imgur.com/RCstARp)

The president’s rule (under Rule 356) was imposed on Uttarakhand on 27th March 2016, a day before the floor test was supposed to happen. Since then, the assembly has been in a state of ‘suspended animation’. The central government was of the opinion that the Speaker of the Uttarakhand Assembly did not conduct the house as per the book, that he let the state budget pass even though the Uttarakhand Government didn’t have the required votes.

[What if the Speaker is being a complete ass?](http://imgur.com/rX785ih)

Members of INC argued here that the speaker (Pillar of Legislature) has a right to conduct the house as he/she pleases. They also held the belief that the Court (Pillar of Judiciary) has a right to question the decision of the President (Pillar of Executive) too. On, 21st April, the Nainital High Court had scrapped the President’s Rule in Uttarakhand, thus challenging the President. 

**Aadhaar Bill, 2016**

> “Speaker is the suxxx. He/she is NOT Supreme.”

> ~ Indian National Congress

Now here's the weird part. 

Incidentally, in case of the Aadhaar Bill, 2016, the Indian National Congress has challenged the Lok Sabha Speaker’s decision to classify the Aadhaar Bill as a money bill. Jairam Ramesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court, the hearing for which is scheduled soon. I have been talking about this case for a while now, so you can read more about it [here](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking).

In this case, INC has argued that the speaker (Pillar of Legislature) is *not* supreme and her decision can be challenged by the Court (Pillar of Judiciary). 

I know I know. It’s utterly confusing. It’s also rather amusing how INC can speak in favour *and* against the same bloody thing. Takes some talent to pull it off.

**So which pillar wins?**

Zoom out a little. 

Imagine these three pillars, side by side. 

The height of the Legislative Pillar is decided by a party’s strength in the Parliament. At the moment, the Pillar of Legislature is standing tall (#MudiRoxx). As with the case with every party in power at the center, they try to find ways and means to infringe and cut down the powers of the other two pillars. 

*In the case of Uttarakhand Assembly*, Legislature was taken over by Executive and both of these pillars were shot down by the Judiciary.

*In the case of Aadhaar Bill*, the Judiciary is challenging the Legislature by questioning its highest functionary, the speaker. Since the Bill has been assented to by the President, they also end up challenging the Executive. If the SC rules that Aadhaar is #NotAMoneyBill and strike it down, it gives a decision against the Executive too.

This battle was underlined by Arun Jaitley with a singular suggestion to the Speaker of Lok Sabha, that if the Supreme Court summons her in the Aadhaar case: **She should ignore them!**

[Madam Speaker, ignore. Just ignore.](http://imgur.com/Lf89cDo)

[Obligatory song dedicated to Mr Jaitley](https://youtu.be/1M8vei3L0L8?t=26s)

The Pillar Fight rages on and much popcorn has been consumed in the process. I am single-handedly making Act II profitable.

I leave you with an interesting comment made by Kalikesh Singh Deo during the Uttarakhand debate:

#Rajya Sabha Association prijhents “Bye Bye Honourable Members Mohatsav”
___

53 members retired from the Rajya Sabha last week after serving 6 years in the house, being awesome and stuff. Prime Minister Modi gave a [farewell speech] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k-HZIMs9xc) on the occasion, which is worth giving a watch (HINDI ALERT).

Before you go further, let me say, **“No. The BJP will not get majority in the Rajya Sabha by 2019.”**

[Here’s a good article explaining why](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/in-this-term-modi-govt-will-never-have-the-numbers-in-rajya-sabha/)
___
**Psst... Umm… Noob question: How are Rajya Sabha Members elected?**

*Don’t be embarrassed if you don’t know! Let me give you a simple rundown of how this whole shindig works. If you already know, feel free to skip this part.*

To put it simply, Rajya Sabha (aka State Council) Members are elected by the people you elect for state assemblies. There is a proportional voting system in place which decides how many members from different political parties will represent a state in the upper house. 

IRL, the party boss decides who gets a Rajya Sabha ticket. The majority political party in the assembly gets to send more members than other parties. The number of RS seats per state are decided according to the population of the state. A member elected for Rajya Sabha serves a term of six years.

The Rajya Sabha, unlike the Lok Sabha, is *never* dissolved. 1/3rd Members of RS resign every two years making the house a perpetual entity. [Here](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/memberstatewise.aspx) is a list of the seats held by each state, present vacancies and other such details.
___

The Rajya Sabha bid a tearful adieu to retiring members who were given a chance to express their emotions. They did express their emotions and how! I have done the painstaking job of going through the debates and pulling out interesting bits which turned the Rajya Sabha into a *nukkad sabha*. 

Much fun was had!

1469471597.0,6,8,51,"Hello /r/India,

I return with another four weeks of fun and frolic at the expense of our elected leaders in Parliament!

Last week, a shiny new cabinet was sworn in, a spirited discussion on Kashmir crisis (and TN Fishermen and Bangladeshi infiltrators) happened, an unknown rule was invoked unknowingly and shot down promptly and many legislations were passed.
Let’s get right into it!

___
#Shiny new Cabinet sworn in
___

Apart from the [53 new members](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/partymemberlist.aspx) that were sworn into Rajya Sabha, PM Modi introduced his new ministers to both houses. Prakash Javadekar replaced Smriti Irani as Minister of Human Resource Development, Vijay Goyal was given Ministry of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs & Sports and Anil Madhav Dave was sworn in as the new Minister of State (Independent charge) of Environment forest and Climate Change. A whole host of new Ministers of State were also sworn in. 

I know what you’re thinking.
 
*What’s the difference between a Cabinet Minister, Minister of State (Independent Charge) and Minister of State?* 

**Cabinet Minister**: Person is given full control over a Ministry and is eligible to attend cabinet meetings (which is the highest decision-making body of the country).

**Minister of State (Independent Charge)**: Person is given charge over a ministry, but the PMO keeps a close watch on how the ministry is functioning. These ministers are allowed to attend cabinet meetings only if the PM’s permits them to do so.

**Minister of State**: Person is given charge of a specific department or just a part of a Ministry, especially when the Ministry is large (Eg: Home, Defence or Finance). The Cabinet Minister has complete authority to decide what tasks are to be given to the MoS within the Ministry. MoS cannot attend cabinet meetings.

Casual Observation: Out of all those who were sworn in, Arjun Ram Meghwal seemed to have gotten the loudest thumps and cheers. He used to be the Chief Whip of BJP in Lok Sabha and has now been made MoS of Finance. 
Seems like he won’t be able to [bicycle to Parliament anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxyz8YASYHk).

Bonus: Here’s the [mother of all government directories](http://goidirectory.nic.in/union_categories.php?ct=E002), in case you want to find out how to reach ministries. This includes state ministries and PSUs as well. Explore away!

#Kashmir Crisis… Bangladeshi Infiltration and Tamil Fishermen
___
Discussions were held in both houses of Parliament regarding the ongoing agitation happening in the Kashmir Valley. While accusations flew thick between the Congress and BJP, regional parties like AIADMK and TMC decided to bring in their own international border issues into the discussion.

Kalyan Banerjee from TMC started speaking about infiltration from Bangladesh to West Bengal when he was interrupted by Ananth Kumar, Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers. He pointed out the Mr Banerjee was going off topic. 

[Then this happened](http://imgur.com/lWsluww)

You're killin it Khargeji!

AIADMK’s A Anwar Raajhaa (With the kind blessings of [Puruchithalaiva Amma](http://mythicalindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/weird_jayalalitha_fans.jpg)) spoke about Kashmir and then switched to talk about the problem of fishermen in Tamil Nadu who are being harassed by the Sri Lankan Navy. Raanjhaa demanded that this should be declared as a national issue as well.

#Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha Adjourns
___
The Parliament was summoned on July 18 for the monsoon session and the news was splattered with headlines like “Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha adjourns”. 

Everyone was like, “What?! Why do these politicians keep disrupting the house? Why don’t these people want to work?” 

Well, they do, but they couldn’t help it this time round.

The adjournment wasn’t because of disruptions, which is usually the cause, but for paying respects to a sitting member of Parliament who passed away. Mr Dalpat Singh Parasate of Shahdol constituency in Madhya Pradesh passed away on June 1 (#RIP). 

It’s a followed practice that in case of the death of a sitting member, Parliament will not transact any business on the first day of sitting as a mark of respect. In case an MP dies while the Parliament is in session, the house is adjourned for the following day. In the Budget session, Mr PA Sangma passed away and a similar adjournment followed. His son Conrad Sangma now occupies his seat of Tura (Meghalaya). 

The first order of business for this session in Lok Sabha was [his swearing in](http://imgur.com/vgFFwdH).

Interestingly enough, Rajya Sabha has decided in May 2016 to [curtail this practice](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajya-sabha-not-to-adjourn-for-day-if-sitting-member-dies-in-intersession-period/article8672837.ece) if the Member of Parliament passes in the interim period. The upper house will now only adjourn if an MP dies during sessions. Lok Sabha sticks to its ol’ ways. 

___
#Thou Shalt not read out Speeches
___

While giving his speech on the Kashmir crisis, A Anwar Raajhaa of the AIADMK happened to just read it out from a few sheets of paper. He even mixed up the sheets in the middle and went off course a few times. 

Rao Indrajit Singh, MoS of Urban Development, took strong offence and got up to object. He asked the chair to stop him because there is a rule against reading out speeches in the Parliament. Well, he goofed up a little though. The person in the chair was Deputy Speaker Dr M Thambidurai. He’s from the AIADMK.

Thambidurai seemed visibly upset that the chair was being questioned and asked Singh to sit down. Although a lot of the conversation was not put on record, witnesses of LSTV will vouch about the use of the word “he’s speaking nonsense” being thrown around rather loudly. At one point, Mr Singh seemed to have given out the impression to the Deputy Speaker that he was being partial towards his own party member. The otherwise calm and gentle Thambidurai seemed to be visibly upset. 

The funny thing is that this is actually a rule. Rule 352 of the [Procedure and Conduct of Business](http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rules.html) says: 

> “A member while speaking shall not…. (xi) read a written speech except with the previous permission of the Chair.” 

So in this case, there was no clarity whether or not the prior permission of the chair was taken. If only Mr Rao Indrajit Singh quoted the rule number, he might have been able to achieve his objective. 

Mods, pliss to tweet the correct rule to him?

**Banks - Mo’ Money, No Problems**

Two major private sector banks, Axis and HDFC, reported results for the quarter ending June and it’s a mixed bag. The bad loans crisis [continued](http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/axis-bank-q1-results-net-profit-bad-loans-on-july-22-2016/325755/) to hit Axis Bank where profits fell by 21%. But HDFC Bank, which mostly focuses on retail borrowers, [managed](http://in.reuters.com/article/hdfc-bank-results-idINKCN1010ML) to entirely miss the crisis as profits were up by 20%. However, the bag isn’t so mixed when it comes to public sector banks which are riddled with problems. The government’s got 99 problems, and 98 of them probably involve the banking sector in one way or another. Now, one way to solve problems is to just throw money at the problem. And 13 public sector banks just [received](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-allocates-rs-22915-cr-for-psu-bank-re-capitalization_7065221.html) about ₹22,915 crore of cash from the government. A back of the envelope calculation says if they had delivered all that cash physically, it would weigh about 275 kgs. Yes, I did the math. After reserving a lot of money to treat the bad loans problem, the banks didn’t have much remaining to lend out to borrowers. And if banks stop lending money, the entire economy grinds to a halt. So the new capital given by the government is supposed to help them get back into the lending game again. The largest recipient of this capital infusion was our largest bank, the State Bank of India that got about ₹7,575 crore. However, this is only a “capital infusion” and definitely not a “bailout”. Who even said bailout? There’s no bailout here. What bailout?

**ELI5 - GST**

GST - You know it’s a thing. But you don’t have a single clue what it’s about. The only time you hear about it is while changing channels on the TV. And from your drunk uncle at wedding receptions who thinks he’s an expert in politics. The Goods and Services Tax is probably the most important tax reform of this decade. It replaces a whole bunch of indirect taxes such as the VAT, Service Tax or Excise Duty. So instead of paying ten taxes at ten places, you only pay one tax at one place. And cutting down on that paperwork starts a domino effect of good things for the economy. At least that’s the theory. But the bill has been stuck in Rajya Sabha for a long time now. So what’s the big hold up? Political parties have been negotiating the finer details of the bill and the negotiations are taking a little more time than everybody expected. Some sore points of disagreement are whether to place a maximum limit of 18% above which the GST tax rate cannot be raised, whether to levy a 1% surcharge on interstate trade and how to resolve any disputes in the process. But now, if you feel like you aren’t getting enough of our beloved parliamentarians that are so hard at work solving our problems in penthouses all around Delhi, then fear no more. Because the government is [planning](http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/gst-hopes-brighten-as-congress-signals-support-bjp-ready-for-debate-in-rajya-sabha_1908866.html) a 5-hour-long debate in the Rajya Sabha aiming to resolve all disputes and pass the bill once and for all. That’s right, back to back five hours of bickering old men in white clothes - without any commercial breaks.

**Tesla to go desi?**

The pollution in Delhi has reached such an alarming level that if a Delhi resident starts smoking 10 packs of cigarettes a day and garnishing his food with powered nicotine while sleeping in a chamber full of passive tobacco smoke, he’ll probably still die of asthma from the polluted air before the lung cancer gets to him. And then there’s Delhi CM Mr. Kejriwal who recently hinted at the possibility of the torturous odd-even rule returning back to Delhi during the upcoming winters to curb pollution. What the city clearly needs is a whole bunch of emission-free electric cars. And accordingly, the government’s making moves to get Tesla, the car company famous for its electric cars to come to India. Apart from offering to promote joint ventures between Tesla and Indian car companies, the government is even [offering](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/tesla-and-make-in-india-a-roadway-to-cleaner-and-greener-india-but-how-soon-326205.html) Tesla land near major ports so it can Make in India and export to other Asian countries as well. However, the pipe dream of driving a Tesla down the national highways is unlikely to come true for at least a few years. Until then, we’ve got to find other ways to reduce pollution. Such as banning all diesel vehicles older than 10 years, which is what the National Green Tribunal just did. NGT, a top environmental court, has [directed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-autos-court-idUSKCN0ZY12P) Delhi transport authorities to de-register any diesel vehicles older than 10 years, and car companies couldn’t be happier.

~~**Tollywoodonomics**~~  **Kollywoodonomics**

Rajinikanth, the Amitabh Bachchan of the South, was out with his latest movie *Kabali*, which opened last Friday in 6,500 theaters, many of which were sold out for the entire weekend. In the movie industry, you’re only as good as your last flop - and in Rajini’s case, his last movie was *Lingaa* and before that, *Kochadaiiyaan* - both of which - well, let's just say that they haven’t exactly been Spielberg material. So you’d think producers would think twice before betting on this next film - but this Rajini we are talking about. He doesn’t follow the laws of economics. The laws of economics follow Ra... okay, yeah, those jokes stopped being funny 10 years ago. But still, people literally pour milk on huge cutouts of this guy. So producers went all in and funded Kabali with a budget of ₹110 crore. Here’s the kicker - the movie had already [earned](http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/how-rajinikanths-kabali-has-earned-rs-200-crore-days-before-its-release-2902140.html) ₹200 crore even before being released. Music rights, overseas rights, satellite rights and all other kinds of rights had already earned the movie a ton of cash before being released. How much did Rajini make off the movie? The actor was reportedly [paid](http://www.catchnews.com/regional-cinema/revealed-this-is-how-much-rajinikanth-charged-for-kabali-movie-news-rajinikanth-kabali-fees-revealed-1469024603.html) ₹35 crore as acting fees plus he’s set to receive another ₹45 crore from first week collections of the movie at the box office. Rajini being Rajini, theaters were sold out but prices for tickets in black ranged up to ₹1,500 with reports saying fans were ready to pay as much as ₹5,000 for tickets. All of this only points to one thing - at 65-years old, Rajini’s still got some swag.

However, mobile internet packs have stood the test of drought to become best-sellers across rural India. Which, I believe, can be taken as conclusive evidence that even farmers in far-reaching corners of rural India love browsing aww-worthy cat photos on the internet.

Honorable Mr. Narendra Modi,

Prime Minister,

Government of India,

Raisina Hill,

New Delhi – 110011

**Subject:** To appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta, to take the right decision on various strong anti-corruption bills and to implement farmers’ issues as per the recommendations of the Swami Nathan Committee Report, I intend to hold an agitation in Delhi…


Honorable Sir,

Dreaming of a corruption-free India, there was a historic citizen agitation across the country, steered from Ramlila Maidan in 2011. Seeing the impact of this agitation, the Parliament on 27th August, 2011, had passed the resolution in the 'Sense of the House’ session. In which, the central government would frame, at the earliest, laws of appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta as well as a Citizen Charter. On the basis of this resolution, the central government had given a written assurance and with that hope, I concluded my agitation on 28th August. As a sequel to this resolution and the historic event, which enthused the citizens with hope, a good six years have passed by. However, even after six years, not a single Law pertaining to anti-corruption has been implemented. Distressed with this situation, I am writing this letter to you.

After your government came to power, for three consecutive years, I have communicated to you regarding appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta through my letters dated 28/08/2014, 18/10/2014, 01/01/2015, 01/01/2016, 19/01/2017 and 28/03/2017. However, there has been no reply form you regarding action on the same.

In order that corruption should be curtailed, the citizens of this country had held a peaceful agitation in Ram Lila Maidan, for the establishment of the law, appointing Lokpal and Lokayukta. At that time, crores of people had come out on the streets, from scores of villages, towns and cities. Because, lives of citizens has become miserable due to large-scale corruption that directly affects their lives. Children from schools and youths from colleges had also come out on the streets. For the first-time, since Independence, such a large number of people had come out on the streets to campaign against corruption. This entire agitation was done peacefully, without any violence.

During the agitation, lakhs of people came on the streets but not one person threw a stone. Hence, this agitation was talked about respectfully in various countries across the world. Perceiving the nature of this agitation as one of public empowerment, the then government passed the law for appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta in the Rajya Sabha, on 17th December 2013 and in the Loksabha on 18th December 2013. It was passed by absolute majority in both the houses. After that, on 1st January 2014, the President of India signed the law to make it into an Act. At that time, the opposition leaders of both the houses had supported the bill. Thereafter, on 26th May 2014, your party came into power. Since then, I’ve been writing to you for three years for the implementation of the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act.

After the Lokpal agitation, the citizens, with great hope, elected the new government under your leadership. It was necessary to give the government some time for due implementation of the Acts. Keeping this in mind, I kept sending you various letters on this issue, as reminders. Neither have you implemented the same or taken any action on my letters. Nor have you had a dialogue on this issue or spoke about Lokpal and Lokayukta in your `Man ki Baat.’ Before coming to power, you had assured the citizens of India that ‘You will give priority to make India, corruption-free.’ Now, also, through large scale advertisements you convey to the public, that for the making of New India, it is necessary to take a pledge to stand against corruption. However, now also, in every State, no work of a citizen is done, without giving money. Implying, that without corruption, issues directly related to citizens, has not decreased.

With the implementation of the Lokpal and Lokayukta Law, 50%-60% of corruption can be curbed. Yet, you are not implementing this law. To curb corruption, along with Lokpal and Lokayukta Act laws like the Right to Reject and Right to Recall will help in curbing corruption. However, you are silent on these laws too. The Prevention of Bribery of Foreign Public officials and Officials of Public International Organization Bill 2011, Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill 2012, The Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill, The Public Procurement Bill 2012 are bills that will curtail corruption, but are pending for 4-5 years in the Parliament. The then government had brought in this bill, four years back. You are neither speaking nor doing anything about this delay.

In order to curb corruption and to strengthen democracy, de-centralization of power is very essential. In order to decentralize power, it is necessary to bring in Law that will strengthen the power of the Gramsabha. The village itself is the owner of its resources. There should be a law that the water, forest and land of the village should not to be taken without the permission of the Gram Sabha. The power of the secretariat should be in the hands of the people-that is, true democracy. However, despite writing letters to you for three years, you have kept mum. Then, how can India, become corruption free?

? It is not in mere making of pledges in front of the public, but in wresting rights in the hands of the people, that India will become corruption-free. The Right to Information Act, is one such example. The most distressing fact is that, despite there being such provision in the law, you are not appointing Lokpal and Lokayukta. The Supreme Court has time and again, directed you to appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta, but your government is still not doing so, despite the fact that this would curb corruption. At one end, you are appointing CBI Chief without the existence of the opposition leader and at the other end, you are giving the excuse of not appointing the Lokpal and Lokayukta, on the pretext that the opposition leader does not exist. This is most unfortunate.
It is surprising that you are giving excuses to appoint Lokayukta and Lokpal. Because, in the Lokpal and Lokayukta Law, it is not mandatory to have the opposition leader’s consent.

Even then, in these three years, no State Government, which is run by you, has appointed Lokpal and Lokayukta. In States where opposition parties have formed the government, there are no appointments of Lokpal and Lokayukta but it is unfortunate that the appointments have not been made in States that are ruled by your party. This makes it clear that you do not have the will to appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta. There is a gap between your talks and your action. Then, how can India, become corruption-free? Isn’t it a humiliation for the Parliament which passed the law, the President of India who signed it and for the citizens who campaigned for it through large scale of agitations?

What is surprising Is that of course there is no appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta in the States where opposition parties are ruling but even in States run by your party, no Lokpal or Lokayukta have been appointed.

In the Agriculture dominated country, India, farmers are committing suicide every day. I have written to you several times on giving farmers, prices as per their costs but I have not received any reply from you nor have you implemented recommendations of the Swami Nathan Committee Report. Since the last few days, farmers in various states like Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana and Rajasthan are coming together and agitating. However, you do not seem to be having any compassion for farmers’ woes. It is clear from this that you have done these amendments not in the interest of the nation and its people but in the interest of party and business owners. This is indeed unfortunate.

It has been clearly noticed over the last three years that you have no compassion in your heart for the grievances of the farmers of the country. Had it been the case, you would have made provision while making the amendments allowing the companies to give any amounts as donations to farmers instead of political parties. Had you done this, it would have strengthened our democracy and restored faith that poverty will be eliminated. It would have provided justice to poor farmers. However, your failure to do so proves that you have no compassion for the poor and farmers. Over the last 42 years, the Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill was tabled before the Parliament on several occasions but could not be passed. However, the Peoples’ Parliament of the nation awakened in August 2011 and the government had to promulgate the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act. Your government has been disrespecting public sentiments in this regard too. 
Therefore, now the time has come to awaken the voters, who are the owners of this country. An awakened voter is the foundation of democracy.

Instead, your government while using some of the amendments you have made while incorporating the Finance Bill 2017 in the Money Bill as illustrations. I shall elaborate on the remaining amendments publically at the time of the agitation. Earlier, there was provision that enabled any company to donate 7.5 per cent of the money earned as profits by it over a period of three years to political parties. However, now you have made amendment and removed the limit of 7.5 per cent and made provision that any company can donate any amount to political parties. The limit for giving donations to political parties have been removed for political parties. Because of this, not democracy but Party machinery will become stronger. If you were truly concerned about farmers and poor people, then you would have done proper research of this Law and stated that any amount of donation can be given, not to political parties but to the farmers and the poor people. That would have made democracy, strong and it would have provided justice to the farmers and poor people. However, it is very clear that you do not have the innate compassion for the poor and for the farmers. If you really want to solve the issues of the farmers, then implementing the Swami Nathan Committee Report, you would have ensured proper prices for the farmers’ produce as per the cost and in order to ensure security to farmers and laborers, it is essential to have a pension scheme.
Citizens have been campaigning for political parties to come under Right to Information Act. Supreme Court too has given clear directives. If you firmly believe in transparency, then it is essential to introspect on political parties coming under the RTI Act.


In order to decentralize power, it is necessary to bring in Law that will strengthen the power of the Gramsabha. To curb corruption, along with Lokpal and Lokayutta Act laws like the Right to Reject and Right to Recall will help in curbing corruption. It is also necessary to bring in laws for women’s’ equality. How can you talk of women’s equality just by putting up posters? In order to curb corruption and to strengthen democracy, de-centralization of power is very essential. The village itself is the owner of its resources. There should be a law that the water, forest and land of the village should not to be taken without the permission of the Gram Sabha. The power of the secretariat should be in the hands of the people-that is, true democracy. If you give the power in the hands of the citizens, then democracy will be strengthened. When the public parliament wakes up there would be a logical end to the issues of Lokpal, Lokayukta, farmers’ problems and other issues. I am confident about that.


Earlier, on 28th March, 2017, I had written a letter to you, that if you do not implement the Lokpal and Lokayukta Law, then my next letter would be about holding another agitation in Delhi. It is in reference with that letter, that I have decided to launch an agitation, for the betterment of the society and the nation.
I have been doing agitations since 35 years. However, I have my agitations were never against any political group, party or any particular individual. My only mission for doing agitations is for the betterment of the society and nation. Since the last three years, I have been reminding the government about the appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta and of farmers receiving appropriate prices for their produce. However, you have not replied to my letters nor have you taken any action on these issues. Hence, I have decided to hold an agitation in Delhi. Until, for the larger public interest, the above issues are not addressed through implementation of the same, I will relentlessly continue my agitation. You shall be informed about my date and venue of my agitation, in my next letter.

Jai Hind!

1492352581.0,6,47,32,"I am in a very big dilemma right now. I have to choose between staying in my current job in Netherlands and become a wealthy man or going back to my own country and stay with my family(and not be so wealthy).

Background:

A bit of a background, I come from a south asian (pakistan,india,bangladesh) country where I lived with my family. I live with my mom, brother and little sister. I am 28 years old and not married. I am responsible for the finances of my house. So i pay for everything, including the college fee of my brother and sister and daily expenses such as food, electricity, rent etc. The college fee is done now as they are both in their last semester. Although, I will still be responsible for our daily expenses.

I recently went to the Netherlands and studied there for two years. I got a degree and even found a really nice job.

I have two options to choose from:

**Option 1: Stay at my current Job in Netherlands**

I have a really nice job in the Netherlands. There is such a big difference in the working conditions that I don't think I can work as a software engineer when I come back home.

My one month's salary in Netherlands is equal to my 3-4 months salary in my own country. In fact the difference in salary is so big that I dont think I can work as a software engineer when I go back home. It will just feel wrong to me to do the same type of work for 1/4th of the money.

Almost all companies treat you like a human in the Netherlands. They have really nice laws about employment law. I don't have to work overtime and even if I do work overtime, I will be paid for the overtime. This is not the case in my own country. In my country they expect you to work overtime and think you are not motivated if you refuse. And they will never pay you for overtime.

In the Netherlands you can be on sick leave for a maximum of two years and still get paid salary. Though it is not so common to be sick for so long but it is really comforting to know. In my country they start deducting your holidays when you are sick. And when all of your holidays are gone then they start deducting your salary. And if you dont show up after two months then there is a big chance you will be let go.

Besides my job, I have other benefits in the Netherlands. I have been on so many dates in the Netherlands which was not so easy in my country. Online dating is still non-existent in my country. I currently have a girlfriend in the Netherlands. I feel really free and independent in terms of dating. I can go to anyone's house and invite any girl in my own house I also have nice public transport, online shopping for almost all video games, books, clothes etc. I have a really nice gym. The only career i can think of having when I go back is do my own business.

While living in Netherlands has good points, there are also some bad things. There are some things that make me hate Netherlands sometimes. If I stay there for one year without a holiday then I get really miserable. I really miss my family on my holidays. I also feel that they sometimes look at us in a condescending way.I have had a lot of incidents related to racism. It seems like they feel like they are much better than us. I have been asked all sorts of questions like : Is there a tv in your country? Do you have internet in your country? Do you know what a washing machine is ? Sometimes people give me a look of disgust even. And they get more weird if they know I am a muslim. 
 
**Option 2: Go back to my home country and live with my family**

I mentioned a lot of really nice things in the first option but I really miss my family and my country's food. My mom is always very sad when my holidays are up and I have to go back. She is always crying when I leave. She said that I can stay in the Netherlands for as long as I want but she is happy when I am around. My little sister also misses me. She told me that I should come back next year. She is going to be married in a few years then I wont be able to see her so often. When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.

Regarding finances, i will have around 20k$ of savings by next year. What is your opinion?",,Stay in an excellent job vs come back to live with my family?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/65nu2c/stay_in_an_excellent_job_vs_come_back_to_live/

1495392186.0,6,21,31,"""Top 5 reasons why layoff in India can be especially hard"" 

Do you agree? 

1. Social stigma: The middle-class in India attaches a lot of ‘status’ to what one does for a living. Among the first questions one gets asked during introductions include “where do you work?” (or “Where does your husband work?”). “He used to work for Infosys and just got laid-off” doesn’t cut it.  

2. Identity and self-worth: Typical middle-class kids are conditioned to work hard to succeed. When one is laid-off due to factors beyond one’s control (‘business reasons’) one begins to question one’s basic values. 

3. Pressure from relatives: Those from an earlier generation – parents, uncles and relatives of IT workers – equate ‘layoff’ to ‘firing.’ Right after layoff, they may begin to gossip “Ramesh was fired by Wipro. I though he was doing well there. What did he do wrong?” 

4. Financial challenges : Many IT workers over-leveraged their finances by “Investing” in expensive, upscale apartments, houses, cars and white-goods with large EMIs and credit card payments. Sudden stoppage of a paycheck can certainly be hard. 

5. Other practical challenges:  Many of those who are being laid-off are single and in their twenties and early thirties. Until recently, an ‘IT groom’ with a nice paycheck was a prime-catch in the matrimonial market. All the news of doom-and-gloom in IT sector is perhaps making families with eligible brides and grooms re-think alliances from those in IT sector.

1423968456.0,6,61,309,"Last year in May 2014, I had sent a letter about profiteering by Indian banks to the Prime Minister's Office, on the day when Mr Narendra Modi took charge. This letter mentioned several points about how banks were exploiting consumers. Some were even charging money for cash withdrawals and for counting currency. I also suggesting ways and means to make life easier for entrepreneurs and tax payers.

The entire letter can be found on my blog.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/18/letter-mr-narendra-modi-prime-minister-india-prevent-profiteering-indian-banks-and-make-lif

After over 35 years of credit cards being introduced in India, RBI has asked all banks to bring down interest rates. For all these years there has never been a cap on how much interest credit card companies could charge. Now, there will be. I'm amazed the way Modi ji and his government has acted to protect the interest of banking customers who have been exploited for decades by banks and credit card companies.

http://www.businessworld.in/news/banking/how-to-stop-profiteering-by-banks-&-make-life-easier-for-taxpayers/1381616/page-0.html

The Prime Minister's office (PMO) sent me a reply a few weeks later, turning my letter into a petition. A few months later I received two replies from the Reserve Bank of India and one reply from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) addressing the capital market reforms I had suggested.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/22/sebi-sends-me-letter-responding-my-letter-honorable-prime-minister

One of the arguments that I put forth in my letter was about excessive interest rates being charged on credit card outstanding dues. To quote from my letter;

*The credit card division of banks needs to be looked at very seriously. Most banks that issue credit cards charge anywhere between 24% and 36% per annum as interest on the funds lent. Most people are not financially very savvy and this sends them into a debt trap. There is no justification for charging 36% on credit card advances when a loan to buy a scooter can be given at 15%.*

With this move, the RBI has implemented my suggestion. To quote the RBI report; *'Interest rates charged on credit card overdue were inordinately high and out of alignment with other products with similar risk profiles'.* The decision on trimming charges was taken at a conference attended by bank ombudsmen and the top rung of the RBI, which included governor Raghuram Rajan. The conference resulted in action points being drawn for the Indian Banks' Association. 

It is very heartening to see the agility with which the government has responded to my suggestions. This will, I hope, go a long way in giving a fair deal to banking consumers, increasing their purchasing power and improving the quality of life of the common man.

I also wrote a letter last month to the Honorable Finance Minister suggesting a Janta Credit Card, to eliminate black money from the economy. Please read it.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/23/my-letter-honorable-finance-minister-shri-arun-jaitley-suggesting-janta-credit-card-elimina

I'm hopeful that the PM and FM will consider implementing this solution. Apart from eliminating black money, it can go a long way towards ensuring inclusive growth, reducing the gap between the haves and have-nots, increasing India's competitiveness and ensuring employment and GDP growth.

**tl;dr: I sent a letter to the Honorable Prime Minister offering several suggestions to counter profiteering by banks, encourage entrepreneurship and reform taxation. One of the suggestions was to slash the interest rate on credit card dues. This was implemented yesterday, 35 years after credit cards were introduced in India.

~fin~",,Indian Startups Last Week: 7th Nov - 13th Nov,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5coba8/indian_startups_last_week_7th_nov_13th_nov/
1510459960.0,6,1,3,"After discussion in https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7bxty7/why_bank_recapitalization_is_a_scam/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage I wanted to make a follow up post.

Since so many people called me out for making up shit I will simply quote from articles this time.


Creation of money by the banks

> The Credit Market Funnel

> Suppose the U.S. Treasury prints up $10 billion in new bills, and the Federal Reserve credits an additional $90 billion in readily liquefiable accounts. At first, it might seem like the economy just received a monetary influx of $100 billion, but that is actually only a very small percentage of the actual money creation.
> 
> This is because of the role of banks and other lending institutions that receive new money. Nearly all of that extra $100 billion enters banking reserves. Banks don't just sit on all of that money, even though the Fed now pays them 0.25% interest to just park the money with the Fed Bank. Most of it is loaned out to governments, businesses and private individuals.
> 
> The credit markets have become a funnel for money distribution. **However, in a fractional reserve banking system, new loans actually create even more new money. With a legally required reserve ratio of 10%, the new $100 billion in bank reserves could potentially result in a nominal monetary increase of $1 trillion.**

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081415/understanding-how-federal-reserve-creates-money.asp

India uses the same system overall but the multiplier is higher.


> Every one rupee of central bank money in India is able to generate around 6 rupees of money supply in the economy. India’s ratio remains lower than that of Europe, but higher than that of the US.

**NPAs in India**

> Public sector banks (PSBs), which accounted for 90 percent of the total gross NPAs of the banking sector, has seen their gross NPAs jumping past Rs 7 lakh crore in June 2017 quarter. In the past seven quarters, it jumped by Rs 4.18 lakh crore or 133 percent to Rs 7.33 lakh crore in June 2017 quarter from Rs 3.14 lakh crore in September 2015 quarter.

http://www.firstpost.com/business/bad-loans-of-indian-banks-cross-rs-800000-cr-banking-mess-explained-in-7-charts-3939999.html


> Public Sector Banks' Gross Non-Performing Assets Hit 9.83%. In FY16
> Gross NPAs of private sector banks were Rs. 48,380 crore, meaning just 2.70 per cent of gross advances of Rs. 17,91,681 crore during the fiscal 2015-16.

http://profit.ndtv.com/news/banking-finance/article-public-sector-banks-gross-non-performing-assets-hit-9-83-in-fy16-1655760

> For example, in the steel sector, Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel have an exposure of close to Rs 1 lakh crore. Other large stressed companies - Jaypee, Lanco, Videocon, and GMR jointly owe over Rs 3 lakh crore to the banking system. Most of them got into non-core activities like real estate which guzzled up the borrowings, resulting in losses and defaults to banks.

http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-centre-identifies-50-large-npas-for-resolution-under-new-ordinance-2430489

> State Bank of India topped the list of banks with wilful defaulters with Rs 15,069 crore stuck in 997 accounts of borrowers, recording a rise of Rs 2,759 crore in fiscal 2017. Punjab National Bank was second with wilful defaults of Rs 10,989 crore in 871 accounts. Bank of Baroda’s wilful defaults soared from Rs 1,367 crore in the year ended March 2016 to Rs 4,785 crore by March 2017.

> Recently, finance minister Arun Jaitley candidly admitted that the bad loan problem was largely confined to some 50 large corporate groups who had indiscriminately borrowed from banks to set up steel and infrastructure projects, especially in the power sector. **These groups alone would account for over 80% of the total NPAs and stressed assets in the banking system.** Latest data shows that the total NPAs and stressed assets are in the range of Rs 13 lakh crore to Rs 14 lakh crore. **And these are politically, well connected corporate families who dominate election funding.**


-
> Overall, the story is one of the taxpayer bailing out the banks and defaulting corporate groups whose promoters will still end up laughing all the way to the bank.

Somewhat of an opinion piece but read out of it what you want.


Based on all the quotes above I want to ask a few questions, why did the government still decide to recapitalize using public money? Why isn't divestment of SBI and PSU banks on the table? 

Doesn't pumping more public money mean doing the same mistake all over again? All the NPAs were given to political friends of Congress around 2009 or so. 

Now without substantial changes big loans will be given to political friends of BJP and it is very likely that the loans will become NPAs some 10 years or so from now.",,Bank recapitalization is socializing losses and privatizing profits.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7cap05/bank_recapitalization_is_socializing_losses_and/

&#x200B;

I come from a middle-class family in Gujarat, and I passed my 12th commerce from a CBSE school. I got good grades and was able to enroll in a very good college in Mumbai, and everything was going well for me. After I got my admission I went back to my hometown to prepare to move to Mumbai in a hostel, when my grandfather who was already in ill-health passed away.

&#x200B;

Now he did not have a will and most of what we owned was in my father's elder brothers name already and what was in my grandfathers name was usurped by him as well. He kicked my father out of the family business as well as made threats for us to leave the place we were staying in(It was registered to my grandpas name). This meant my own families financial status went from somewhat stable to completely in shambles. We were blindsided and that meant I had to stay and help my father weather the storm. At first I thought we'd bounce back in a month or 2 and having never known poverty I never knew ho much people struggled. But it only got worse for us. My father is an 8th pass and could not get normal jobs, so he decided to start a new business and I took a job with a friend of his due to my English skills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some time passed then scumbag had us evicted as he and my aunt(bua) made some deal that she should have the house. I do not know the details of what they did but we were forced to rent a place and our already poor finances were shot to pieces. My father started to work as a salesman cause no other option and I took on a bigger role at his friends place. But things were still hard and we were barely making ends meet.

&#x200B;

I forgot all about my college and education, never going back to Mumbai after my enrollment. My family trudged along for 2 and a half years but things are changing now. My father has a childhood friend who is offering my father a good role in his business back in their old village. He is moving there and starts at first November. Now he told me that I can finally go to Mumbai and finish my college if I wanted to but I'm not even sure what to do at this point.

&#x200B;

I never went to Mumbai after my admission but this year would have been my final year. Am I still even enrolled there? They have my documents as I never collected them back. But I never paid any fees except what you pay on enrollment. My father wants me to go and try to study as he thinks his lack of education was a major reason for our family's crisis cause he had nothing to fall back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I don't even know if I am enrolled there anymore. The college is affiliated with Mumbai university but I could not find any details about their code on skipping exams\[By exams I mean skipping everything :( \] on google. And even If I'm still enrolled how long would it take me to finish my degree. Hell at this point I'm pondering is a [B.com](https://B.com) even worth it? My dream was to do a masters from foreign but even If I finish my degree will I get enrollment in any institute as I had these many drop years. I am really confused at this point weather to move to the village with my family or try to pursue an education.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any knowledge on how Mumbai university operates or even any advice on how to proceed please help me.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr : Scumbag uncle and aunt usurped everything and I could not attend a single day of college. Now I may finally be able to go but Idk if I am even enrolled there anymore. Please help. Any advice appreciated.",,"Due to family problems, I had to forego my college education. Now I may have the option to finally do something about that. Please advice me on how to proceed?

The shit hole goes very deep and the problem is compounded by the fact that the media ""tones"" down its coverage (obviously to avoid panic). There are malware attacks (on ICICI which is siphoning of email contacts and sending its account holders phishing emails), Advanced persistent threats on Axis Bank (they disclosed this to RBI), ATM frauds as in State Bank of India and multiple accounts of phishing attacks on individuals. Union Bank has also suffered cyber heist. 

A worrying trend is by use of SIM Swap. Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp), your details through identity thefts and blocking your actual SIM's so that you cannot receive the SMS alerts. 

Two factor authentication is very basic (dependent on passwords alone) which again can be easily retrieved because most users re-use their passwords. 

Its getting scarier and worsened. 


A simple remedy as of now is to change PIN of your existing debit card and get ""CHIP and PIN"" card which secures transaction because they cannot be replicated easily. Of course, moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised. 

Edit 1: In response to ""proofs"" and so called ""click bait""; here are the links. Please connect the dots. 
Further, BBM and Threema allow you to be anonymous because outside the system, they can't do anything to your PINS. :-)

1481876081.0,6,0,0,"Set during WWII, this excerpt talks about a jealous Colonel Black setting up the  Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade to expose another character as a communist. 

When fellow administrative officers expressed astonishment at Colornel Cathcart’s choice of Major Major, Captain Black muttered that there was something funny going on. when they remarked that Major Major was somewhat odd, Captain Black announced that he was a Communist.

“They’re taking over everything,” he declared rebelliously. “Well, you fellows can stand around and let them if you want to, but I’m not going to. I’m going to do something about it. From now on I’m going to make every son of a bitch who comes to my intelligence tent sign a loyalty oath. And I’m not going to let that bastard Major Major sign one even if he wants to.”

Almost overnight the Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade was in full flower, and Captain Black was enraptured to discover himself spearheading it. He had really hit on something. All the enlisted men and officers on combat duty had to sign a loyalty oath to get their map cases from the intelligence tent, a second loyalty oath to receive their flak suits and parachutes from the parachute tent, a third loyalty oath for Lieutenant Balkington, the motor vehicle officer, to be allowed to ride from the squadron to the airfield in one of the trucks. Every time they turned around there was another loyalty oath to be signed. They signed a loyalty oath to get their pay from the finance officer, to obtain their PX supplies, to have their hair cut by the Italian barbers. To Captain Black, every officer who supported his Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade was a competitor, and he planned and plotted twenty-four hours a day to keep one step ahead. He would stand second to none in his devotion to country. When other officers had followed his urging and introduced loyalty oaths of their own, he went them one better by making every son of a bitch who came to his intelligence tent sign two loyalty oaths, then three, then four; then he introduced the pledge of allegiance, and after that “The Star-Spangled Banner,” one chorus, two choruses, three choruses, four choruses. Each time Captain Black forged ahead of his competitors, he swung upon them scornfully for their failure to follow his example. Each time they followed his example, he retreated with concern and racked his brain for some new stratagem that would enable him to turn upon them scornfully again.

Without realizing how it had come about, the combat men in the squadron discovered themselves dominated by the administrators appointed to serve them. They were bullied, insulted, harassed and shoved about all day long by one after the other. When they voiced objection, Captain Black replied that people who were loyal would not mind signing all the loyalty oaths they had to. To anyone who questioned the effectiveness of the loyalty oaths, he replied that people who really did owe allegiance to their country would be proud to pledge it as often as he forced them to. And to anyone who questioned the morality, he replied that “The Star-Spangled Banner” was the greatest piece of music ever composed. The more loyalty oaths a person signed, the more loyal he was; to Captain Black it was as simple as that, and he had Corporal Kolodny sign hundreds with his name each day so that he could always prove he was more loyal than anyone else.

“Of course, it’s up to you,” Captain Black pointed out. “Nobody’s trying to pressure you. But everyone else is making them sign loyalty oaths, and it’s going to look mighty funny to the F.B.I. if you are the only ones who don’t care enough about your country to sign loyalty oaths. If you want to get a bad reputation, that’s nobody’s business but your own. All we’re trying to do is help.”",,This brilliant excerpt from Catch-22 captures what is happening in India right now.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5il51f/this_brilliant_excerpt_from_catch22_captures_what/
1423072817.0,6,8,6,"Some disillusioned members of the AAP have taken up the case of the party’s dubious funding. The AAP is a brilliant propagandist. It claims to wear the label of honesty on its sleeves. It disclosed the names of a large number of corporate entities from whom it received donation by cheque. The disillusioned AAP members appear to have conducted a search of these with the Registrar of Companies. The search uncovered the curious character of the donor companies.


The companies do not do any business. They have no profits from any legitimate business. They are “Entry lending companies”. The functioning of these “entry lending companies” is very simple. At times there are a large number of inter-connected companies created through a multi layering process. Money is got transferred from one to another. The companies are registered at obscure addresses. The directors of these companies are unknown people, usually name lenders for a miniscule consideration. These directors are usually low paid employees of those behind the racket. These companies are used either for hawala payments or round tripping of their own funds. They convert cash into cheque.


Most of these ingredients are present in the case of the companies which are donors of AAP. Surely, when a company donates lakhs and crores to a political party, the party would attempt to know as to who the controlling interest behind these companies are? The only fact that the donations have been made by cheque does not purify the transaction. Withdrawal from Swiss bank accounts can also be made by cheques. Where a political party converts black money into white, its receipt would obviously be by cheque. That cannot wash away the sins of the convertor or the recipient since the entire transaction is fraudulent and a tax evasion exercise. Arvind Kejriwal is not a novice to India’s taxation laws. He is a former officer of the Indian Revenue Service. He knows very well that such transactions are dealt with under the Income Tax Act and not the Indian Penal Code. Why does he then dare the Finance Minister to arrest him? Is it only a bluff and bluster exercise? A company can donate a maximum of 7½ (seven and half) percent of its average net profit of the three preceding financial years to political party. Did the recipient Aam Aadmi Party verify this fact? Did it verify the controlling interest behind these companies? Can it even now tell us who was the individual who brought these donations and whether he had the financial resources to pay or was it a round tripping of its cash available?


If Kejriwal were still a Revenue Service officer and a case of such money conversion through sham companies resulting in donations to a political party had landed on his table, what he would have done? Would he have asked the assessee to write a letter to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India or allowed him to argue that a payment by cheque to political parties forgives all sins of black money conversion? Would he have arrested the fraudulent assessee under the Indian Penal Code rather than proceeding under the Income Tax Act? Surely Kejriwal is not a stranger to the tax laws. He knew what his party was doing. He should be honest enough to tell the people what “Arvind Kejriwal, IRS” would have done under these circumstances?",,"What would Arvind Kejriwal, IRS have done?- Arun Jaitley",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2uqpex/what_would_arvind_kejriwal_irs_have_done_arun/
1502127309.0,6,95,549,"Context – Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. 

On the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It’s published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. 

So here we go

* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. 

* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna

* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.

* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important

* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.

* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities

* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship 

* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.

* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. 

* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. 

* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat

* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action

* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev’s Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying “I have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving”. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. 

* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party – **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** 

* The Takeover of Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.

* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev’s political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘Some people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma’. Soon Ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.

* Ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**

* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO – **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev’s business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra’s influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. 

* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee – **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)

* Part of the reason for Patanjali’s market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section – [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) 

* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.

Ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. 

Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.

1.""In November 1998, the day after the Japanese Government announced a large-scale fiscal stimulus to its ailing economy, Moody’s Investors Service began the first of a series of downgradings of the Japanese Government’s yen-denominated bonds, by taking the Aaa (triple A) rating away. The next major Moody’s downgrade occurred on September 8, 2000.

Then, in December 2001, Moody’s further downgraded the Japan Governments yen-denominated bond rating to Aa3 from Aa2. On May 31, 2002, Moody’s Investors Service cut Japan’s long-term credit rating by a further two grades to A2, or below that given to Botswana, Chile and Hungary.

In a statement at the time, Moody’s said that its decision “reflects the conclusion that the Japanese government’s current and anticipated economic policies will be insufficient to prevent continued deterioration in Japan’s domestic debt position … Japan’s general government indebtedness, however measured, will approach levels unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed world, and as such Japan will be entering ‘uncharted territory’.”

The then Japanese Finance Minister responded (with some foresight): “They’re doing it for business. Just because they do such things we won’t change our policies … The market doesn’t seem to be paying attention.” Indeed, the Government continued to have no problems finding buyers for their debt, which is all yen-denominated and sold mainly to domestic investors. 
How … could a country that receives foreign aid from Japan have a better rating than Japan itself? Japan, with an economy almost 1,000 times the size of Botswana’s, has the world’s largest foreign reserves, $446 billion; the world’s largest domestic savings, $11.4 trillion; and about $1 trillion in overseas investments. And 95 percent of the debt is held by Japanese people 

In the New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/business/international-business-japan-battles-bond-rating.html] the logic of the rating was questioned:

2. Comment by formers President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and former member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Bob McTeer who is described as having “free-market views” which “gave the Dallas Fed its reputation during his tenure as “The Free-Enterprise Fed”” (Source). McTeer says:

    It may just be me, but aren’t the credit rating agencies supposed to be rating credit?

    Yesterday, we saw a sharp market reaction when one of the rating agencies that gave AAA ratings to mortgage-backed securities larded with subprime loans called into question the credit worthiness of Britain. As is the case with the United States and the Federal Reserve, Britain and its Bank of England have the ability to create new money if necessary to pay off its debt at maturity. There is no sovereign credit risk. There is no need for credit rating agencies to opine on the credit worthiness of sovereign debt.

    Sovereign debt is subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates in general rise, outstanding bonds, sovereign and non-sovereign, will decline in price, the extent depending on how close they are to maturity.

    Sovereign debt is also subject to inflation risk. Holders of the debt are harmed if inflation outpaces their expectations when they purchased the debt.

    When Standard & Poor questions British bonds, they must be making a judgment about some risk other than credit risk. Given time, investors will learn to take such questions with a grain of salt and not overreact. Meanwhile, haven’t they done enough harm for this cycle?""

4.""Ratings agencies admit mistakes - Credit rating agencies have admitted errors were made when assessing some of the financial instruments that have been blamed for the credit crunch.

Representatives of the three main agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch, Moodys - were grilled by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

They said that their assessment of securities backed by sub-prime mortgages turned out to be incorrect.

But they said these instruments were not too complex to rate accurately.

""The assumption that we made about how these assets would perform in the future turned out to be incorrect,"" said Ian Bell, head of European structured finance at Standard & Poor's.

Iceland role

Credit agencies carry out work to determine the worthiness or otherwise of financial investments.

They have been accused of failing to spot the size and risk of the bad US housing debt that was resold around the world, causing multi-billion-pound losses.

It was the discovery of these losses that caused the global credit markets to freeze up, and ultimately led to governments around the world having to bail out their banking sectors.

The ratings agencies said that credit ratings were just one factor that investors should look at when making investment decisions, but admitted that less sophisticated investors may have been over-reliant on their assessments.

The committee also criticised the agencies for failing to warn their clients adequately of the problems faced by the Icelandic economy before its banks collapsed last year.

Some 116 local councils deposited more than £858m in the failed banks, because they offered a relatively high return with a high credit rating.""

5.""Who's to Blame for the Economy? Rating Agencies - A good measure of who is responsible for getting us into this mess is looking at who got rich off of it. Bond ratings agencies certainly got their share of the take.

Moody's Investors Service ( MCO) saw its profits quadruple between 2000 and 2007 and had a higher profit margin than any other company in the S&P 500 for five straight years, according to opening statements from Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations, in a congressional hearing on the ratings agencies he held in October.""

The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC)[39] set up by the US Congress and President to investigate the causes of the crisis, and publisher of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (FCIR), concluded that the ""failures"" of the Big Three rating agencies were ""essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction"" and ""key enablers of the financial meltdown"".[40] It went on to say

    The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies. Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms.""

8. Moody's And Japan - But think about the Moodys statement in relation to Japan. The logic (and that is being kind) goes like this:

             1. Economic growth is low in Japan and is pushing tax revenue down and welfare spending up – hence the budget deficit rises.

              2. Given the Japanese government doesn’t exercise its legal right to spend without issuing debt to match the spending, the rising budget deficit (as a result of the cyclical downturn) also means rising public debt.

             3. Moodys asserts (with no analytical or conceptual basis provided) that these rising deficits are in some way a problem per se (rather than being a reflection of the real problem – slow growth).

            4. So in their Pavlovian fashion, they downgrade the credit rating presumably suggesting the Japanese government is a credit risk without acknowledging the Japanese government can never be an credit risk unless there is a collective brain explosion and the Government legislates to renege on its financial obligations.

            5. They downgrade because the slow growth makes it more difficult to reduce the budget deficit without acknowledging that the budget deficit should increase to meet the challenge of slow growth.

           6. But then you are left to ask two questions. First, the Moodys logic would suggest they want to increase the borrowing costs of the Japanese government by reducing the demand for bonds (because the lower rating is meant to scare investors) which if you believed their type of reasoning would further negatively impact on economic growth. So what sort of logic is that? Moodys (if you had their model outlook) is saying the Japanese economy is damaged because of the recession but we are going to make it worse and therefore worsen the problem of credit risk.

           7. Second, of-course, neither their implicit notion that Japanese government debt carries a credit risk or that their ratings change anything anyway are valid. Note that a sign that government paper was not an attractive investment prospect might be rising yields as investors avoided demanding the paper. But Moodys acknowledges that there is an “undiminished home bias of Japanese investors and their preference for government bonds, which allows the government’s fiscal deficits to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally”.

So who would you bet on? A corrupt capitalist firm that has made some monumental mistakes in the past while handing out AAA ratings to firms who were paying them to rate their products or millions of investors who every day purchase Japanese government debt at stable and the lowest yields? The same investors who have been buying Japanese government debt while deficits have been rising and public debt ratios heading up beyond 200 per cent (compared to the ridiculous Reinhardt Rogoff default threshold of 80 per cent) for the last 20 years.""

8. ""What mindless rule is being applied here?

The whole thing is mindless. To repeat, the logic appears to be: Cut deficits to keep the Aaa rating – but that would undermine growth and push up the deficit and debt – which undermines the Aaa rating.

And the politicians and everyone else goes along with this nonsense. We really are not a very bright race of people.""

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",,"With the recent Oxfam India Inequality report & Congress' Minimum Income Guarantee announcement, why aren't we discussing AOC's 70% marginal tax in India already?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/alx3kj/with_the_recent_oxfam_india_inequality_report/
1552304367.0,6,3,6,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

With a view to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and use of such funds for subversive activities, and for eliminating Black Money ,Government decides to cancel the legal tender character of the High Denomination bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 from the expiry of the 8th November, 2016. 




            With a view to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and use of such funds for subversive activities such as espionage, smuggling of arms, drugs and other contrabands into India, and for eliminating Black Money which casts a long shadow of parallel economy on our real economy, it has been decided to cancel the legal tender character of the High Denomination bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations issued by RBI till now. This will take effect from the expiry of the 8th November, 2016.
 
2.         Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) in circulation in these denominations are comparatively larger as compared to those in other denominations. For a common person, the fake notes look similar to genuine notes. Use of FICN facilitates financing of terrorism and drug trafficking. Use of high denomination notes for storage of unaccounted wealth has been evident from cash recoveries made by law enforcement agencies from time to time. High denomination notes are known to facilitate generation of black money.In this connection, it may be noted that while the total number of bank notes in circulation rose by 40% between 2011 and 2016, the increase in number of notes of Rs.500/- denomination was 76% and for Rs.1,000/- denomination was 109% during this period. New Series bank notes of Rs.500/- and Rs.2,000/- denominations will be introduced for circulation from 10th November, 2016. Infusion of Rs.2,000/- bank notes will be monitored and regulated by RBI. Introduction of new series of banknotes which will be distinctly different from the current ones in terms of look, design, size and colour has been planned.
 
3.         The World Bank in July, 2010 estimated the size of the shadow economy for India at 20.7% of the GDP in 1999 and rising to 23.2% in 2007. There are similar estimates made by other Indian and international agencies. A parallel shadow economy corrodes and eats into the vitals of the country’s economy. It generates inflation which adversely affects the poor and the middle classes more than others. It deprives Government of its legitimate revenues which could have been otherwise used for welfare and development activities.

4.         In the last two years, the Government has taken a number of steps to curb the menace of black money in the economy including setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT); enacting a law regarding undisclosed foreign income and assets; amending the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and Mauritius and India and Cyprus; reaching an understanding with Switzerland for getting information on Bank accounts held by Indians with HSBC; encouraging the use of non-cash and digital payments; amending the Benami Transactions Act; and implementing the Income Declaration Scheme 2016. 

5.         In order to implement the above decisions of the Government and keeping in view the need to minimise inconvenience to the public, the following operational guidelines have been issued:-
 
(i)            Old High Denomination Bank Notes may be deposited by individuals/persons into their bank accounts and/or exchanged in bank branches or Issue Offices of RBI till the close of business hours on 30th December, 2016.

(ii)          Old High Denomination Bank Notes of aggregate value of Rs.4,000/- only or below held by a person can be exchanged by him/her at any bank branch or Issue Office of Reserve Bank of India for any denomination of bank notes having legal tender character, provided a Requisition Slip as per format to be specified by RBI is presented with proof of identity and along with the Old High Denomination Bank Notes. Similar facilities will also be made available in Post Offices.

(iii)        The limit of Rs.4,000/- for exchanging Old High Denomination Bank Notes at bank branches or at issue offices of Reserve Bank of India will be reviewed after 15 days and appropriate notification issued, as may be necessary.

(iv)        There will not be any limit on the quantity or value of Old High Denomination Bank Notes to be credited to the account of the tenderer maintained with the bank, where the Old High Denomination Bank Notes are tendered. However, in accounts where compliance with extant Know Your Customer (KYC) norms is not complete, a maximum value of Rs.50,000/- of Old High Denomination Bank Notes can be deposited.

(v)          The equivalent value of the Old High Denomination Bank Notes tendered can be credited to an account maintained by the tenderer at any bank in accordance with standard banking procedure and on production of valid proof of Identity.

(vi)        The equivalent value of the Old High Denomination Bank Notes tendered can be credited to a third party account, provided specific authorisation therefor accorded by the said account holder is presented to the bank, following standard banking procedure and on production of valid proof of Identity of the person actually tendering.

(vii)      Cash withdrawal from a bank account, over the counter will be restricted to Rs.10,000/- subject to an overall limit of Rs. 20,000/- in a week for the first fortnight, i.e., until the end of business hours on November 24, 2016.

(viii)    There will be no restriction on the use of any non-cash method of operating the account which will include cheques, demand drafts, credit/debit cards, mobile wallets and electronic fund transfer mechanisms.

(ix)        Withdrawal from ATMs would be restricted to Rs.2,000 per day per card up to November 18, 2016. The limit will be raised to Rs.4,000 per day per card from November 19, 2016 onwards.

(x)          For those who are unable to exchange their Old High Denomination Bank Notes or deposit the same in their bank accounts on or before December 30, 2016, an opportunity will be given to them to do so at specified offices of the RBI on later dates along with necessary documentation as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of India.

(xi)        Instruction is also being issued for closure of banks and Government Treasuries, on 9th November, 2016.

(xii)      In addition, all ATMs, Cash Deposit Machines, Cash Recyclers and any other machine used for receipt and payment of cash will remain shut on 9th and 10th November, 2016.

(xiii)    The bank branches and Government Treasuries will function from 10th November, 2016.

(xiv)    To avoid inconvenience to the public for the first 72 Hours, Old High Denomination Bank Notes will continue to be accepted at Government Hospitals and pharmacies in these hospitals/Railway ticketing counters/ticket counters of Government/Public Sector Undertaking buses and airline ticketing counters at airports; for purchases at consumer co-operative societies, at milk booths, at crematoria/burial grounds, at petrol/diesel/gas stations of Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies and for arriving and departing passengers at international airports and for foreign tourists to exchange foreign currency at airports up to a specified amount.

**Big Oil To Get Fatter**

One of the ideas being thrown around to deal with the bad loans crisis was merging all 27 state-owned banks to make 6 really huge banks. Taking inspiration from that idea, the government is now throwing around another idea - [merging](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/government-set-to-start-talks-on-merging-13-state-oil-companies-to-create-behemoth/articleshow/53371857.cms) 13 big state-owned oil companies to make 1 really huge oil company. Companies like ONGC, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum lead the list of the 13 companies being considered for this mega-merger. Even as oil prices nearly committed suicide last year, just the top 6 state-owned oil companies still managed to report revenues of ₹9.3 trillions. So clearly, the 1 giant oil company that will come out of these mergers will be big enough to rival the likes of UK’s BP and Russia’s Rosneft. But it will still be a few ranks smaller than some of the biggest oil companies in the world. And at least when it comes to business, size does matter. This idea of merging oil companies isn’t a new idea - it’s been brought up and shot down numerous times in the past mainly due to concerns over reduced competition. Mergers are extra difficult for government companies because after every merger, there’s some extra fat that you have to trim. But government companies tend to focus on social welfare before profit - which means keeping that extra fat to pump up employment in the country. Even if the prospect of this 1 giant oil company with trillions in revenue seems huge right now, rest assured, it won’t be bigger than *yo mama*.

**Gone Are The Days Of Jabong**

The e-commerce industry made multiple headlines last week - the biggest story being the acquisition of Jabong. Flipkart-owned Myntra went shopping around for companies and [dropped](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/rocket-internets-jabong-sold-to-flipkart-owned-rival-myntra-for-70m/) $70 million on Jabong, creating the largest online fashion company. The second-highest bidder for Jabong was Snapdeal which offered $50 million followed by Future Group (that owns the Big Bazaar stores) which offered $35 million. It’s been a tough couple of years for Jabong. Even Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla of the e-commerce business, briefly considered acquiring Jabong for $1 billion back in 2014. Compared to that price tag, Flipkart got a nice discount of 93%. However, the days aren’t as rosy as they sound for Flipkart. Exhibit A - the company just [fired](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/start-ups/article-flipkart-to-lay-off-hundreds-of-underperforming-employees-report-1437780) about 700 employees and tried to play it off as “a fairly common practice”. Exhibit B - Industry reports released last week indicate that Amazon has [surpassed](http://www.firstpost.com/business/most-consumers-preferred-amazon-over-flipkart-for-online-transactions-in-2016-says-survey-2915798.html) Flipkart to become India’s preferred online destination. Exhibit C - Snapdeal reached 1 million daily transacting users, more than those of Flipkart and Amazon put together. Seems like bad news does come in threes.

**RIO MMXVI**

The 2016 Olympic Games are set to begin next week in Brazil. As the media begins extensive coverage of the events, get ready for the millions of Indians that will be shocked to find out about the existence of sports other than cricket and fighting trolls online. Just as the international media came at India with pitchforks drawn for botching up the 2010 Commonwealth Games, let’s turn those pitchforks around and poke other countries for mismanaging international sporting events. The host nation, Brazil is going through its worst economic crisis since 1930 and its worst health crisis since 1918. The country’s GDP contracted by 4% in 2015, and is expected to [contract](http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-02-22/budget-rio-olympics-16-times-higher-budget-combat-zika-virus) by another 3% in 2016. Plus there’s the small matter of Zika viruses roaming around giving birth defects to unborn babies. Technically, the country doesn’t have a President since the most recent one was suspended under charges of corruption. Considering all of that, just the fact that Brazil hasn’t descended into anarchy is an achievement. The government has allocated $9.7 billion for the Olympic Games, which is 16 times more than the budget allocated to deal with the Zika virus that has already infected 1.5 million Brazilians. Hashtag Priorities. However, every Olympic Game since 1968 has exceeded its budget by an average of 179% which means that $9.7 billion could very well balloon up to $17 billion. Godspeed Brazil, godspeed.

**News Flash: Old Age Is Tough**

Most people’s idea of preparing for retirement includes investing in 1) Fixed Deposits, 2) Mutual Funds or 3) A kid or two. But a survey by the investment bank HSBC [found](http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/finance/47-indians-not-saving-for-retirement-hsbc_1908299.html) that 47% of the working people in India haven’t even started saving for retirement. No need to panic - the global average is around the same at 46% - so the rest of the world is as deep in this swamp as India. The HSBC survey also found the 80% of Indians seek advice about retirement from friends and family - which basically means that your primary source of information about retirement is that one balding uncle you have who walks around with a beer belly and midlife crisis. That’s just one survey. Here’s another - the annual Global Retirement Index published by Natixis, one of the biggest asset management companies in France, [ranked](http://qz.com/737382/india-is-the-worst-place-in-the-world-to-retire-2/) India as the 43rd best country to retire. That doesn’t seem so bad until you realize that the Index only tracks 43 countries to begin with, and India finished last. Dispelling any notions that India finished last due to all the nice guys in the country, the index mentioned the pitiful state of India’s healthcare system as one of the reasons that we finished last. Meanwhile, Norway and Switzerland were ranked as the best places to retire.

1515329817.0,6,3,0,"It's time for Indians to invest in Canada

Jagdish Pathak

There are more than one million Indian-origin immigrants in Canada. But compared to rising number of Indian-origin immigrants, Indian investment has not kept pace in Canada. However, slowly but steadily, Indian investments are trickling into the Canadian economy. Economic stability has become key to Canada's success and is decisive in attracting investors from all over the world to its shores. Investment in Canada is considered a safe haven for investors' hard-earned money and continues to represent a solid foundation for future growth and prosperity. 

Canada is the No. 1 investment destination in the G7 and was ranked 4th in the world as the best country to conduct business over the period 2010-14, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Business Environment Ranking August 2010 report. 

Indian investors have still been shy about investing in Canada. Most investors from India prefer the UK and Europe as well as the countries of the Middle East, historically. Outside this region, Indian investments are scattered and limited. Canada is a stable, secure nation, and endowed with abundant natural resources. Its currency has always been very stable and its safest borders are with the largest economy of the world. Canada/US relations can be described as the best that any two nations can have. 

Canada ranks 27th in terms of FDI investment in India and its investments are mostly in the development sector. Whereas Indian FDI approved until 2009 in Canada is restricted to $570 million and ranks as the 20th destination of Indian investments. 

Recently, in Windsor, I saw a big hoarding on the road showing the name ""Aditya Birla"" on it. I stopped and looked at it with admiration, thinking, at last, Indian investors have made up their mind to make Canada their destination for good. 

Indian investors should consider Canada and especially the province of Ontario to be the hub of their North American business activities. Ontario has liberal laws, a huge existing infrastructure, and various tax benefits to investors, relatively milder climate, fertile farmlands and, without doubt, some of the best golf courses in the world in your neighborhood. 

People here are well aware of Indian investments in the automotive sector of the UK. During the purchasing phase of the Jaguar and Land Rover deal by Tata, India and its investors were commonly discussed in Ontario bars and restaurants. Ontario is the hub of automotive industries and support services for manufacturing automobiles of big-3: US and Japanese car manufacturers like Honda and Toyota. Southwestern Ontario is a key entry point for US and South American markets. 

Canadians are very knowledgeable about India and its information technology-related successes. India is no longer a nation of beggars and snake- charmers in the minds of a younger generation of Canadian citizens. Growth of the Indian software industry has made a big mark on the Canadian psyche. 

Any investment in Canada will have to be planned over the long term similar to US investors in the past. Canadian oil and energy, forestry, mines and minerals, and gold and diamond resources are some of the best resources for investors to look at. The Canadian higher education system is one of the best in the world and at par with the US, resulting in students from across the globe studying and performing high quality research. 

Investors from India are relatively conservative by nature and prefer to satisfy some critical marks before deciding to invest. Canada is one such country which should be the destination of long-term investors from India. One might look at some of the investments made by Indian investors in the Ontario province and think how much is there on offer in this well-endowed province alone. Investments by Essar group in energy and steel, by Mahindra Satyam and Wipro in the IT sector are a good beginning. However, the quantity of investment is negligible, compared to China, which is making substantial investment in the core sectors of oil and energy, solar and wind power generation and forestry. 

A strategic investment in developed nations like Canada goes with the Indian aspiration of becoming a global power. Indian investors can fulfill such desires in conjunction with the geo-political leadership potential of India.

1449849356.0,6,2,12,"This text might be bit longer and I will do my best to annotate, bear with me please. This is another You should know thread inspired by the previous earlier you should know thread about Paranjoy Guha thakurta, Srinivas Reddy and Press Council of India. Since that was successful, let's see how it goes.

Let's start with a story, a tale that we might not know but we should know and be cautious (hopefully).

1) Enron, Houston based natural gas company,  now defunct, had had a sweetheart deal with our country. What is a sweetheart deal? [1]

2) Enron project was the first private power project in India. Congress ruled maharashtra state government entered into a **power purchase agreement** with Enron and a 695 megawatt power plant was signed in 1993. BJP and Shiv Sena -then in opposition - went all desi and filed legal proceedings against Enron and state govt. Next year, that was their only campaign issue.

3) Feb 1995 - BJP and Shiv Sena won the elections. They were righteous and **scrapped** the project. Mr. Advani - then leader of opposition in parliament - termed it as 'loot through liberalization'. He sort of accused Congress govt of taking a **695 crore bribe** from Enron. Enron said that it had paid millions of dollars for *educating* the politicians and bureaucrats, so that they understand the significance of the project.

4)  After the project was cancelled, US govt began to pressure the MH govt. [2] US ambassador Frank Wisner, deplored the cancellation. **It is purely coincidental that the day he completed his term as ambassador, he joined Enron as director.** [3]. 

5) November 1995 - BJP and Shiv Sena appointed a *re-negotiation* committee. 

6) May 1996 - Minority govt headed by BJP was sworn in as centre. It lasted for exactly 13 days before resigning to face a vote of no-confidence in Lok Sabha. On it's **last day at office**, despite of the no-confidence motion in progress, the cabinet met for a hurried lunch and re-ratified the national govt's counter-guarantee for the Enron project (which had become void since the earlier contract was cancelled). 

7) August 1996 - The MH govt singed a fresh contract with Enron. [4] 

8) The previous contract had involved annual payments to Enron of $340 million for phase 1 (695 MW) with phase 2 (2015 MW) being optional. The re-negotiated power purchase agreement made phase 2 mandatory and legally binding on MH State electricity board (MESB) to pay Enron a sum of **30 billion**.  It was the largest ever contract in Indian history. The gross profits were around $12 to $14 billion dollars. **The official return on equity was more than 30%, which was double of what is permissible under Indian law.** [5]

9) The increase of 18% of installed capacity caused MSEB to put 70% of it's revenue to be able to pay Enron. NOICE.

10) May 1997 - Supreme court refused to entertain an appeal against Enron. 

11) 2001 - Everything that was critiqued against the project, came back to haunt. The power produced was twice as expensive as the nearest competitor and seven times expensive of the cheapest electricity available in MH. [6]

12) May 2000 - MH Electricity regulatory committee ruled that as long as it was absolutely necessary, no power should be bought from Enron. The calculation was, it would be **cheaper to just pay Enron the mandatory fixed charges for the power plant which was legally binding than to actually buy and use the power produced from the plant.** The fixed charges was 1000 crore a year for phase 1 of the project. Phase 2 would have been nearly twice the size. 

13) January 2001 - MH govt - now with new Congress govt with new CM - announced it didn't have money to pay enron. [7]

14) 6th February, 2001 - Ten days after the earthquake in Gujarat, the country was reeling from the disaster. **Enron invoked the counter-guarantee that if govt didn't come up with cash, it be auctioning the govt properties pledged as collateral security in the contract.** [8] [9]

15) Enron and MH govt then entered into court battle, while then US ambassador, Richard Celeste, publicly chastised MH govt for not being able to pay Enron. [10]. BTW, Enron was President Bush's largest campaign donor. 

16) Five years later, This plant was taken over by Ratnagiri Gas and Power Private limited in July 2005.

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetheart_deal

[2] http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1011566556405983800 - **After presenting his credentials this summer, Ambassador Robert D. Blackwill wasted no time in warning the Indians that Enron's problems were at the top of the Bush administration's commercial agenda. ""I want to be frank,"" Mr. Blackwill told the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce and the Indo-American Society. ""These disputes have darkened India's investment climate.""** 

[3] http://www.apfn.org/enron/wisner.htm - Enron and Wisner. 

[4] http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/10/business/enron-can-resume-big-indian-power-project.html - **Clearance by the national Government was the final hurdle for the stalled project 250 miles south of Bombay. Enron Development, a unit of the Enron Corporation of Houston, revised the project after the Maharashtra state government had canceled it last August. The renegotiated proposals for the plant were approved by Maharashtra authorities in January. But work at the site could not resume without fresh approval from New Delhi. ""Prime Minister Deve Gowda phoned the Chief Minister to say that the project has been cleared,"" Maharashtra's finance minister, Eknathrao Khadse, said.**

**7th Pay Commission**

If entrepreneurship is where ambitions get fulfilled, a 9-to-5 bureaucratic government desk job is where ambitions get killed. A government job is an excellent way to start your career, if what you want is to also end your career in a government job because once you’re in there, you really need to screw up big time to be thrown out. How big? You could even skip work for 24 years before being fired like [this](https://www.rt.com/news/221543-india-government-employee-fired/) guy. Along with the literally fire-proof long-term job security, there’s also the chance of making a little buck from time to time with bribes - although few will admit it. But the jobs do come with the downside of being low paid. And the government is working to change that. Every ten years since independence, the government appoints a “pay commission” that recommends what to change in the salaries of over 1 crore government employees and pensioners. The government recently accepted the recommendations of the 7th and the latest pay commission which include an average pay hike of about 24%. It [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/7th-pay-commission-salary-hike-govt-salary-hike-arun-jaitley-2886723/) spending an additional ₹1 lakh crore (that’s 1 followed by 12 zeros) annually to accommodate increased salaries and pensions. Some of the money will presumably go right back into government coffers through taxes. But a range of other issues have stuck out as thorns and lakhs of government employees have threatened to go on strike if they remain unresolved.

**The Banks Need A Stress Ball**

It's been a long, long time since the RBI’s crusade against bad loans in the banking system started. But it doesn’t show any signs of stopping in the near future as the situation has only deteriorated. And if things continue going downhill, banks like the Bank of Maharashtra will probably have to switch slogans from ‘One Family One Bank’ to ‘One Bank One Bankruptcy’. The most recent round of stress tests at the RBI indicate that the banks are in desperate need of a vacation to de-stress for a little bit. The central bank [warned](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/stability-of-banks-has-worsened-significantly/article8784540.ece) that stability in the banking system has significantly worsened since mid-2010s. There is no use praying for the speedy recovery of our banking system as even the RBI did not exactly sound optimistic. At minimum, the central bank expects the amount of bad loans to rise from 7.6% this year to 8.5% next year. And at maximum, that figure can reach 9.3%. Profitability at the banks is in the dumps, having gone [down](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/takeaways-from-rbis-stress-test-banks-very-close-to-tipping-point/articleshow/52967108.cms) by 43% due to write-offs. Looking back at this mess, you can’t help but wonder what will happen if the banking crisis hits a tipping point, if the Punjab National Bank goes from ‘The Name You Can Bank Upon’ to ‘The Name That Just Went Bankrupt’.

**One Giant Leap for ISRO**

Every time ISRO makes news with a launch, you get that occasional story in your social feed that you like without reading and feel proud for about an hour, space exploration replaces Salman Khan on the list of things people care about, #ISRO trends on twitter, NRIs get that occasional feeling of guilt over contributing to brain drain and Shahrukh Khan is relevant because Swades. Well, here’s the story that you might’ve already seen and liked without reading: last week, ISRO made news in the global space commerce industry by [launching](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/isro-throws-satellite-making-open-to-private-sector-1423043) 20 satellites in one rocket. 17 of the 20 satellites were from foreign customers of Antrix, the commercial arm of ISRO.  It’s really anyone’s guess how much Antrix or ISRO charges for one satellite launch, but Antrix did report revenues of over ₹1,800 crore in 2015. But the launch wasn’t the only ISRO event making news. AS Kiran Kumar, chairman of ISRO invited the private sector to make a full spacecraft. So far, private companies like Larsen & Toubro or Godrej Aerospace have only manufactured the components that go into the making of a satellite.

**Time To Go Public**

India has two stock exchanges that really matter - the NSE and the BSE. So if those two companies wish to go public and list on the stock market, they’ve got two options to begin with. One, list shares on the rival stock exchange and risk being regulated by a competitor. Or two, list shares on it’s own stock exchange which is prohibited by regulations due to being the most obvious conflict of interest since the makers of sliced bread said it was the best thing ever. While the BSE is already in the process of listing shares and going public, the NSE [entered](http://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/nse-plans-to-file-ipo-document-by-jan-2017/article8779637.ece) the fray last week by announcing plans to go public as well. Interestingly, along with plans to list shares in India, the company also intends to list overseas by April of next year. It’s a fantastic time of the year to go public. Despite the naysayers of Brexit, recent IPOs have [received](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-ipos-idUSL4N19Q22K) a lot attention from investors and the IPO pipeline currently has big names like Vodafone, ICICI Prudential and L&T Infotech.

* The UnMidas Touch - is what Vijay Mallya seems to be suffering from where everything that he touches just turns to poop. I know I said poop. Grow up and stop giggling. A second attempt to auction his private luxury jet [failed](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/vijay-mallyas-personal-jet-on-auction-only-bidder-offers-rs-1-crore-1427051) as exactly one buyer showed up and bid ₹1 crore, which was way below the minimum price of ₹152 crore. Earlier this year, attempts to auction the Kingfisher House for ₹150 crore and Kingfisher brands for ₹327 crore failed as well since no bidders showed up.

* When popular party songs overuse catchphrases like *“Party all night!”*, what they really mean to say is, *“Party till 1 AM when the bar will close and kick us out at which point the party will stop!”*. You can see the problem - it doesn’t rhyme well. But that might not matter for long. The central government [cleared](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Goodbye-curfew-hours/articleshow/52982257.cms) a law allowing restaurants, bars, shops, movie theaters and more to remain open 24x7, so you actually can party all night. Aimed at increasing employment, the law lifts the collective curfew placed on all Indians. However, the final decision to implement or ignore the change has been left to state governments.

This statistic comes in the middle of the 90-day window given by the government where it has [promised](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/sm685foUYic1odLvsTAgOI/Come-clean-by-30-September-Arun-Jaitley-to-black-money-hold.html) to not investigate anyone who declares black money, and pays a 45% tax including a penalty. But the question is - can you trust the government to honour its end of the agreement? You just know that at the very least, your name is going to end up on some “special watchlist” at the Income Tax Department.

**A Government of India Original**

The stage has been set - on one side, we have the world renowned economist, Raghuram Rajan and on the other side, we have the new MP on the block, Subramanian Swamy. It’s a battle of wits. It’s a battle of politics. But to find out if Rajan gets a second term at the RBI, or if Swamy successfully sends Rajan back to the US - watch out for season 2, coming this August. Apparently, the government is going to keep everyone [waiting](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-govt-to-take-call-on-raghuram-rajan-s-rbi-term-extension-in-august-2215544) till the 11th hour and only decide if Rajan gets a second term at the RBI in August, a month before his current term expires. Just when you thought you were getting into the show, they drop a huge cliffhanger and make you wait for the next season. Don’t you hate it when that happens? We already have the protagonist and the antagonist for this plot - might as well add in some supporting characters: Uday Kotak - promoter of the Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Adi Godrej - head of the Godrej group have endorsed Rajan for a second term. Even a poll of top CEOs from corporate India found overwhelming support for Rajan. So everyone wants a second term for Rajan. But that’s the thing with season premiers - they tend to take very unexpected plot twists.


**Another Round of Startup ~~Funding~~ Troubles**

Zimply, PepperTap, Stayzilla, TinyOwl, Swiggy… these words don’t sound like words at all. And until a few years ago, they were just a bunch of typos. But today, they are all venture-funded startups that recruit from some of the best talent pools in the country, the IIMs. Or at least they used to, until the startup boom turned into a balloon that’s constantly trying to run away from thorns. In the recent round of troubles, officials in charge of placements at IIMs are annoyed with startups deferring joining dates and marking down pay packages. To take the classic example of what happened with Flipkart, the company told all new recruits from IIM-A to sit back and relax for now and join the company in December instead of joining next month. And in exchange for the lost pay which can often run into several lakhs, Flipkart will bump up the signing bonus by a sweet ₹1.5 lakh. Now, the authorities at IIM-A are not happy with [these](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/iim-ahmedabad-asks-flipkart-to-address-placement-issue-2819413/) shenanigans at all, since a lot of students have loans they need to pay back. And have warned startups that there could be consequences. Moreover, what if the students take up writing in their free time till December? India cannot afford another Chetan Bhagat right now.

**A Change of Plans**

Last August, the RBI gave approvals to 11 companies to set up payments banks. The 11 companies are some of the who’s who of the business world - Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla, Vodafone, Airtel, IDFC Bank, Tech Mahindra and many more. And then there was also the Indian Department of Posts. But what in god’s name is a payments bank, I hear you ask. A payments bank is just a normal bank, except it can’t give out loans. And before you ask the next most obvious question, they make money from fees and commissions. But increasingly, the process of chasing after the RBI to obtain these approvals is starting to resemble dogs chasing after cars. They wouldn’t know what to do if they ever caught one. Now, three entities that received approvals including IDFC Bank and Tech Mahindra are [dropping](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/tech-mahindra-drops-out-of-payments-bank-race-841548) plans to ever start a payments bank. The primary reason given for the change of plans is that competing with 11 other deep pocketed companies will result into wafer-thin profits which doesn’t make business sense. In short, simple capitalism at work. After all, chasing after things we don’t have, only to realize that we don’t want it when we do get our hands on it - is a timeless classic that is rooted deep inside all of us.

**Pakistan Is Listing Everything**

In 2013, Pakistan, our dear neighbour to the west, was about to Greece the place up by defaulting on its loans. You didn’t hear much about this because the IMF swooped in and saved the day by bailing Pakistan out to the tune of $6.7 billion. But IMF money rarely comes with no strings attached. As part of the bailout, Pakistan was required to privatize the economy by listing many of its state-owned companies on the stock exchange. Last week, the country [announced](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/world-news/pakistan-to-start-soft-marketing-state-airline-sale-in-june/263644/) that it is looking for investors as it plans to do exactly that and list over 68 companies including the Pakistan International Airlines, a bunch of steel mills and utility companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which by the way is also being listed. So if you know a friend who’s got a few million lying around - hit them up, Pakistan’s looking for investors. Or we could make a kickstarter campaign. I can kick in 50 bucks. Either way, this is definitely not Pakistan’s week. Historically, India didn’t have access to Central Asia and Afghanistan since Pakistan blocked all the land routes. But with a newly [signed](http://qz.com/690217/india-just-played-a-masterstroke-in-iran-to-reinforce-its-regional-soft-power-status-in-asia/) contract with Iran, India can potentially bypass Pakistan and trade with Afghanistan and Central Asia through a sea route to Iran and a rail link from there on.

But forget all of that. After a 2-year drought, we have a monsoon on our doorsteps that has been forecast as above average - and experts [say](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/forget-fed-brace-up-for-monsoon-bonanza-on-d-street-el-nino-is-gone/articleshow/52430422.cms), this is the event that will define the economy over the next few months.

In the city of timbaktu, during summers, a new travel agent announced the best summer holiday tour package ever. He promised best food, stay at top hotel property in the town, with world class services, complete sight seeing, free vehicle service, some surprise deals only for timbaktu people, with no extra or hidden charges. Adding to the glamour, all this with service tax waived off. 

As in any other city, timbaktu also had enough number of people, who were fed up of below average cheap deals provided by other travel agents, without realizing, that it was more about hotels not being able to manage big uneducated, indisciplined crowds at cheap rates, and not about quality of hotel staff alone. Not to forget, hotel staff was from timbaktu only. Moreover, our new agent, calling himself, ""The most common travel agency ever"", had declared that while all other travel agencies had secret deals with hotel owners, he had no such arrangements, and so, by saving on commissions, he will give them better services at half the rates, eventhough hotel owners had not reduced their rates.

So, that year, ""The most common travel agency ever"" had a vey good business, they managed to break record of getting highest sales figure in the opening year of any business. Looking at its success, to save their credit in the market, other agencies that had poor sales figures, decided to shift their customers to the new agency. So, in the end, ""The most common travel agency ever"" managed to become hotel property's most preferred and top priority agency, and so, the new agency, who had booked maximum number of rooms, became decision maker of the hotel property. According to hotel's rule book, that entire summer, hotel will be managed by ""The most common travel agency ever"", and they will be reponsible for operations of the hotel, profits and loss.

Now that ""the most common travel agency ever"" was on the management seat of hotel property, it was in their hands to provide all that they had promised. The only difference now was that they had to manage finance and economics of that hotel too, alongwith their guests - the people of timbaktu. As promised, they declared change in hotel tariffs and menu prices of restaurants, even increased number of free services provided by the hotel. They even used satyagrah weapons when hotel owners tried to use their veto power through security staff. Here, it is worth to mention that security staff of hotel was kept in the hands of hotel owners, because, this particular hotel was in the most sensitive zones of the area. And hotel owners did not want to play with security of property while trying to promote democratic way of management, where, customer with highest numbers of room booked, has a say in hotel management.

However, during those satyagrah days, guests from timbaktu faced many problems, but they thought it was for their good only, and, so, ignored.

Then one day, suddenly, ""The most common travel agency ever"" declared that there was a dispute betwin, hotel owners and the representatives of ""most common travel agency ever"" - who were on management seat. Suddenly, they decided to resign and leave from the position of hotel's management. According to hotel owners, they only had asked ""The most common travel agency ever"" to follow hotel processes, to ensure no glitch in service delivery to guests. After resigning, hotel owners rolled back all free services and tariff cuts.

People of timbaktu, who had come on tour with ""The most common travel agency ever"" to enjoy their vacations, were now at the helm of hotel owner - the same hotel owner that was declared as ""corrrupt agent"" by ""The most common travel agency ever"". somehow, they managed to spend their time till the tour package deal ended, thinking, however bad hotel services are, they are atleast there to give services. people of timbaktu came back from summer tour safely somehow. Not to forget, ending up paying more then they had agreed.

There was no news of ""The most common travel agency ever"" till winters. However, during winters, there was news around the town, that ""The most common travel agency ever"" had started their branch in honolulu, which was a much bigger town, and promised 10 times more sales then timbaktu. there was also news that in honolulu, they had unearthed more ""secret deals betwin hotels and travel agents"". somehow, ""The most common travel agency ever"" had managed to maintain their honest image. However, according to industry analysts, it was not by giving good deals, but by showing corrupt side of other travel agents. Worth mentioning here for the reader, it was heard that industry analysts were also in secret deal with hotel owners.

By next summers, ""The most common travel agency ever"" had branches across the continent. So, they thought it to be safe enough to come back to timbaktu. afterall, timbaktu was their launchpad.

However, in timbaktu, someone, still not able to forget how they were left alone, hangin in the middle of corrupt agents, managed to slap the owner of ""the most common travel agency ever"". He was heard shouting ""I know what you did last summer"" repeatedly, which was ignored by onlookers, as most of the onlookers were deaf, which was a coincidence, and considered to be natures way of balancing the existence of someone silent since last 10 summers.

Fearing to loose their credibility, industry analysts declared that the one who slapped the epitome of honesty was paid agent of corrupt hotel owners. However, for the owners of ""The most common travel agency ever"", this is a good chance to prove that people of timbaktu are not well behaved, and that was the reason for failure of that deal.

Meanwhile,
1. There is no effect on the business of hotel owners, as all travel agencies, new or old, are dependat on an economy that is highly affected by business of hotel owners. Not to forget, travel agencies, being middlemen, can at most, negotiate freebies for guests, but can not, and dare not, build and run hotels.
2. Timbaktu, and people around other cities in the continent, have considerble amount of people who believe that it is possible to force hotel owners to make a deal where hotels will be managed at loss. And that for timbaktu's existence hotel owners are inconsequential. Amount of such people is good enough for the new party to continue in future for long.
3. Some hotel owners, who are given certificates of honesty for taking no commissions have joined the new travel agency. To accomodate them, they have renamed it to, ""The most common travel agency ever pvt. Ltd.""

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

**WANTED: RBI Governor**

Alright, you knew this was coming. You don’t live under a rock. You’ve heard about this. We have had wall to wall coverage of this story since it broke. And as the most important economic story of the week, it has to be talked about here. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan does not [want](http://in.reuters.com/article/rbi-chief-rajan-quit-idINKCN0Z50N2) a second term. In a message to the RBI staff that was released on the central bank’s website, Rajan has stated his desire to not continue as the governor. Instead, he’s going back to his old teaching job in the US. Apparently, the governor was very much interested in serving a second term. But getting reappointed would mean that he would have to maneuver the delicate political minefield. And Rajan was unwilling to get down and dirty in the intricate interlockings of Indian politics, which has now become more complex than the plot of Game of Thrones. And so, the House of Rajan will now be leaving the show in September. This decision to not continue marks a political victory for the campaign against his reappointment, which was led by Subramanium from the House of Swamy. 


**Flying Higher**

Rule 4/20 is the rule that states you must smoke a little something when the clock strikes 4:20. Rule 5/20 is not as exciting or fun, and only applies to the Indian aviation industry. The 5/20 rule states that any Indian airliner must have 5 years of experience flying domestic routes and must own 20 aircrafts before it can operate any international routes. It might sound like redundant regulation to you, but that’s not how the folks at Jet Airways and SpiceJet see this. To incumbent airliners who already satisfy the rule, this is hugely beneficial since it removes competition on international routes. But to newer airliners like Air Asia who don’t satisfy the rule, this is a lost business opportunity. But a new civil aviation policy approved last week [removed](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-airlines-rules-idINKCN0Z110J) the 5-year experience requirement, however the 20 aircraft rule still stands, making it the 0/20 rule. A big round of FDI reforms has also eased rules for FDI in the aviation industry.

**EU & Britain - The Big Divorce**

Britain, the real reason why Indians love tea and cricket, is going through a messy divorce. In a nation-wide referendum, Britishers will soon vote if they want the country to leave the European Union or stay in the European Union. A popular argument for staying in the EU cites the disastrous effects that the British economy is expected to experience if it leaves. The UK Treasury [says](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/macro-view/talking-point-brexit-and-indian-markets/article8748796.ece) that if Britain leaves, inflation will spike, unemployment will rise, and GDP growth might be 6% lower. But let’s be honest, most of you can’t be bothered to keep up with even the Indian economy. The news is boring, uninteresting, mundane and all the other synonyms of boring. And here is a story asking you to care about the British economy. So before you tune out, know that you should care about this because the global economy is a series of dominos, and one of them might fall next week. Most of the world is urging Britain to stay in the EU. But really, the only evidence that anyone needs to take into consideration is - Donald Trump supports Britain leaving the EU. And that right there, should be enough information for the British people to know which way to vote.

**STILL WANTED: RBI Governor**

You know what? We haven’t talked about this enough. This story deserves another look. The big news of Rajan’s departure was dropped in an open letter that Rajan wrote to the RBI staff. And it caught everyone off-guard, including the government. While Rajan gets ready for his exit interview, the government is busy looking at résumés of candidates to fill his position. The news of his departure isn’t even a week old, but the race to replace him is already starting to heat up. The shortlist has as many as [seven](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/seven-names-on-long-list-to-replace-rbis-rajan-official-1420762) people, but the frontrunner right now is Arundhati Bhattacharya, a high-profile banker who has been at the helm of India's largest lender - State Bank of India. If you think you can make the shortlist, send your CV to: Sansad Marg, Janpath, New Delhi, Delhi 110001. Either way, get ready to bid farewell to Rajan. It sure was good while it lasted, wasn’t it? But like all good things in life, it had to come to an end. Rajan, we had a lot of fun together, didn’t we? Remember when you cut consumer inflation from a high of 11.16% to a low of 3.69%? Yeah.. Good times. And remember when you increased the foreign exchange reserves from $275 billion to $363 billion? Yeah... Those were the days. I’m sorry, I think I need some time alone.

E-commerce is when you sell inventory directly to the buyer. Current regulations don’t allow FDI in e-commerce, which means foreign companies like Amazon can’t enter the e-commerce industry. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently met PM Modi and lobbied him to allow FDI in e-commerce. One can only imagine how frustrated Bezos must’ve felt when they told him that last week, India [eased](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/govt-to-hold-briefing-on-fdi-rules-today/article8751887.ece) FDI rules for 9 industries including aviation, defense, pharma and food processing.

* Larsen & Toubro has [bagged](http://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-qatar-idINKCN0YS0P2) a $135 million contract to build a stadium in Qatar for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. $135 million is a lot of money. Qatar’s economy is largely based on oil and prices are not exactly ideal right now. So if you’re wondering how they are even paying for the stadium, wonder no more - The Gulf country has cut planned spending on building hospitals by about two-thirds in 2016 following the drop in oil prices to keep expenditure on its World Cup-related projects unchanged. Those are some solid priorities right there.

* It hasn’t even been a week since the news of Rajan’s departure broke and bad news has already [started](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/wpi-inflation-rises-to-079-in-may-on-higher-food-prices/article8727957.ece) rolling in. Consumer inflation, which halved during Rajan’s tenure, came in at a 21-month high of 5.76% for the month of May. Food prices for the month went up by 7.55%, also a 21-month high. Wholesale inflation, which was negative until two months ago, came in at a 19-month high of 0.76%. RAJAN. THERE IS STILL TIME. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME.

Lower class voted for AAP because freebies .

1-  Will stop development agenda and reforms

2-  Bring many  populist schemes in coming years

3-  Consolidate Hindu votes because a particular community never votes for it , no matter what . This will lead to appeal for hindutava for consolidation.

While doing above 3 things, following will the result.

1- Fiscal deficit will go to a toss because government will borrow more to finance the populist scheme.

2- Very little resources will be spent on infrastructure, defense, education 

3- FDI will get reduced because no infrastructure, no incentives .

4- Corp-Tax will be increased to finance the freebies which will hurt the competitiveness of business in global market.

5- EXport will get reduced because our industry won't be able to compete with China.

Budget Priorities. Collect more and give less alms.

Mohan Guruswamy

Stripped of all the verbiage the main function of a government is to collect taxes. To do so effectively and successfully it must preserve order and stability; and ensure conditions to keep the economy growing. The more it grows the more revenues it collects and therefore how much it collects is the truest index of its success. The power of a nation is directly related to the revenues it realizes from its citizens. The United States is powerful because it collects almost $8800 per capita from its citizens. Those who predict the imminent rise of China and then India to the rarefied heights of being a global power do not seem to realize that China collects only $390 per capita and India only $110 per capita. I have particularly in mind one official in the Ministry of Finance who goes from meeting to meeting with a PowerPoint presentation of in a few years India will be a world power in a few decades giving rise to much self delusional optimism among the national elite. There is no doubt that the GDP’s of China and India will close in on that of the USA within the next three or four decades. But we will still be nowhere near the USA when it comes to that raw index of true power. How much money does the State have to spend?

A State has four main streams of collecting taxes. These are corporate and personal income taxes; and customs and excise duties. Every year as the budget proposals for the next year are being written there is a general clamor from Trade and Industry bodies like the CII, FICCI and Assocham pleading for a reduction of the rates of all these. While they package their pleas with what purports to be sound economic logic, the real logic is just that the fat cats want to get still fatter.

Of course taxes ought to be reasonable and balanced to give the State more money to spend without imposing a back breaking burden on its private and corporate citizens. To find this reason and fine balance is what good government is all about. Too high an incidence of taxation will not only encourage cheating on taxes but will make industry and commerce unprofitable and dis-incentivize individuals. There was a time in this country when personal income tax was as high as 98% for the highest slab. The consequence was that there were few honest people at the higher slabs. Cheating the State became a common practice. With the rates now much more sensible this is not so common. Ditto for customs and excise duties. The only outcome of the extortionate rate of taxes we used to have only a few decades ago is still seen in the continuing incidence of corruption in the tax collecting departments of the government. It is no wonder then that an IRS son-in-law is still a prize catch for many a family!

But are taxes still too high in India? Let’s take corporate taxes. The USA and Japan top the list with 40% and 40.69% respectively. Germany collects 38.36%, Italy 37.25% and Canada 36.10%. Among the G-20 countries only China imposes a smaller percentage than India. China’s rate is a flat 33% and India’s is 33.99%. China’s rate has been steady at 33% for the past five years while India’s has declined by almost 2%. As a matter of fact only India among the G-20 has been steadily reducing the incidence of corporate taxation. Despite this uncollected taxes are on the rise.
The government could have been richer by a gargantuan Rs.5.8 lakh crore if the IT department had not been dragging its feet over recovering the amount in time or holding up files in appeal cases at the Commissioner of Income Tax level. Another Rs.2.1 lakh crore that is stuck in litigation cases at the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, high courts and the Supreme Court. The total figure is now over Rs.8 lakh crore.
These figures have been highlighted in the latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) tabled in Parliament. The report points out a tax demand for Rs.2.9 lakh crore remained uncollected at the end of March 31, 2011. ""The recovery mechanism is inefficient as certified demand remaining uncollected increased to Rs.1,06,990 crore (96.3 per cent) in 2010-11 from 26,703 crore (75.8 per cent) in 2006-07,"" the report adds.

Quite clearly this has more to do with the usual bad habits and bad government than high taxation? Meanwhile in the case of the USA the average corporate tax rate had risen by as high as 6%. Fighting two wars can be an expensive business. But so can modernizing a nation and fighting poverty by creating 12 million jobs a year.

In the details provided by Mr. Chidambaram in last years budget proposals is another gem. The effective tax rate for Public Sector companies was 23.35% while that of the Private Sector that CII and FICCI champion was just 19.50%. The IT sector has become the bellwether of Indian enterprise. The IT majors have been performing exceptionally not just in the stock market but also in the real world. They have been posting income gains and rising profits year after year. One would have thought that the self professedly socially conscious leaders of this sector would have given the State, which has also got to cater to hundreds of millions of people living well below an acceptable living standard, something for giving them large catchment area of math proficiency. On the other hand the IT sector took away Rs. 11,880 crores as deduction on export profits. The telecom sector is adding almost 12 million new subscribers each month now. It took Rs.6850 crores in exemption. And these are the sunrise sectors. I dread to imagine what the new day is going to be like then?

But what must cause the MoF even more concern is that China’s government revenues have been growing by almost 17% each year since 1998. And India’s has been growing relatively slowly at 12% in comparison. It’s true that their GDP has been growing faster than ours. But it is also true that they collect more taxes and give far lesser write-offs.

**Going Gaga Over GST**

Last week, the Rajya Sabha [passed](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/gst-bill-pass-what-next-step-by-step-until-the-rollout-2952723/) the Goods and Services Tax (GST) - the tax reform that has been heralded as the most important piece of legislation in over a decade. While the common market of Europe is walking backwards due to Brexit, the common market within India is stepping ahead due to GST. The bill has been the subject of political bickering for a long time now. However, it was passed with 203 votes for and none against. With 0 votes against. They didn’t even blink twice, so you know there families weren’t being held hostage and all votes were entirely voluntary. But this has only been the tip of the iceberg. Even though both houses of the parliament have passed the bill, there is a laundry list of things that need to happen before we can all go home and forget about this whole GST business. The Lok Sabha needs to approve the bill once again. Then, a minimum of 15 state governments need to pass the bill. Then, the president needs to sign the bill. Then, a GST Council needs to be formed and the GST tax rate needs to be negotiated. Then, the central government needs to pass two supporting laws, and each state needs to pass a separate supporting law. And only then, we’ll be able to pocket all that cash from the GST-led economic growth that is being predicted. The deadline set for all of this is April 1st, 2017. Till then, government officials around the country are set to debate on extremely sensitive issues like whether cream biscuits should be taxed at the same rate as ordinary biscuits. #TeamBourbon.

**Uber-Didi**

Uber joined the long list of American MNCs that came to do business in China but inevitably fell on their faces. In a deal announced last week, the popular ride-hailing service will sell its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in [exchange](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/business/dealbook/china-uber-didi-chuxing.html?_r=0) for a 20% stake in Didi, who will invest $1 billion in Uber. The two giants have been battling for the Chinese market for years and despite spending billions of dollars, no one has managed to turn a profit. In fact, Uber was facing a loss of $1 billion annually due to heavy competition in China. Once upon a time, Uber’s future in China seemed to hold promise. And now, the company is throwing in the towel. The company’s mistake? It tried to fight a land war in Asia. Although Didi was the bigger company in China in terms of market share, Uber did have its moments. Such as when a Chinese hip-hop artist posted a gangster rap song about how much he prefers Uber. Don’t Baidu it - China being China censored the whole thing just days later.

**Loans For *Pani Puri wala*s**

Banks use all sorts of fancy algorithms to determine if a borrower will repay a loan. Despite all of that, with the banking crisis, a huge amount of loans are at a risk of being Vijay Mallya-ed. So the fancy algorithms haven’t exactly worked out. Another one of those fancy things that banks use is a credit score. A good credit score will have banks lining outside your door shouting for your attention. A bad credit score will have you lining outside the door of the banks with a ton of paperwork. You need a good credit score to get loans. But to get a good credit score, you need to repay loans. So you see the chicken-and-egg problem here. This means a lot of people don’t even have credit scores. But those people still need loans. And banks won’t touch them with a ten-foot pole. Now, microfinance companies like Edelweiss, Bharat Financial, DHFL and many more are going places feared by the big boys of finance. A big push in the industry is to loan [money](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/saturated-cities-now-even-idli-vada-seller-can-get-loan/articleshow/53515598.cms) to pavement hawkers, scrap dealers and other self-employed individuals. For example - the makers of the extremely healthy chinese food at the hand-kart that parks near the local sewer every evening. Basically, giving loans to low-income borrowers without a credit score or any kind of formal financial history. If that sounds like a recipe for trouble, that’s because it is and we’ve already had that dish in the run-up of the financial crisis of 2008. And if history isn’t repeating itself here, it’s definitely rhyming.


**Too Many Branches Spoil The Bank**

The State Bank Of India has almost 17,000 branches which is very impressive. Especially since they get to brag about it in tables that rank banks by number of branches. But the bank isn’t doing itself any favours by putting 5 branches within a 1 km radius of each other, as is the case a lot of times with SBI. Because sometimes, it’s not the size that matters, it’s what you do with it that matters. And SBI is [considering](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/sbi-weighs-plan-to-shut-relocate-30-of-its-branches/articleshow/53494912.cms) a proposal to do away with such extra branches by consolidating them. It might make common sense to shut down branches when put like that, but then they won’t get to brag about how many branches they have. And investors love those kind of things. SBI is currently in the process of merging with its associate banks from Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore and so on. It expects to have that completed by March 2017. At which point, that 17,000 number will balloon up to 24,000 branches, compounding that problem. A global consulting firm, McKinsey which was hired by SBI has recommended shutting down upto of 7,200 of those branches. Moreover, bank branches are so *2000s*. Online is where it’s at.

1494883276.0,6,133,106,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.

**Last Week On Rajan Watch**

Last year, PM Modi called RBI Governor Rajan as the “best teacher” for explaining complex economic issues to him. Days later, Rajan said the teaching went both ways. Aww. But the bromance doesn’t end there. Reports saying the PM is “proud” of Rajan surfaced last week [stating](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rajan-insight-idUSKCN0YM2SC) that any campaign against Rajan will not affect the big decision that he needs to make on Rajan’s reappointment. That might’ve been a snide reference to MP Subramanian Swamy’s moves to remove Rajan, Swamy has even rebuked Rajan for “speaking like a grandfather” (what? with artificial teeth? I mean Rajan is already 53, while Swamy is 76). Being best buds with Modi will definitely help Rajan secure his governorship at the RBI for a second term. But then, later in the day, reports [surfaced](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-doesnt-want-extension-media-report/articleshow/52536142.cms) that Rajan doesn’t even want to continue as Governor and would rather be a spectator in the game by going back to teach in the US and continue research on the Indian economy. Apparently, his family has already left. Somebody better buy the rights to this reality show - I’m personally hanging by the edge of my seat. Rajan is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the interest rate meeting this week. And the markets are expected to worry more about the “Rexit” - Rajan exiting the RBI than the interest rates this week. 

**Lincoln Could Only Do So Much**

When you have North Korea, Uzbekistan, Cambodia and Qatar at the top of a list - you pretty much know that the it isn’t the list of world’s happiest countries, it just has to be a list about something bad. Last week, India [shared](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-18-35-million-people-india-tops-global-slavery-index-1413891) a spot on such a list with all of these countries and it was the list that ranks countries in terms of slavery. Yikes. Owning a person might’ve gone out of fashion decades ago, but the trend is still alive - With a global figure of 46 million modern-day slaves, India is home to 18 million of those modern-day slaves followed by 3 million in China and 2 million in Pakistan that are implicated in domestic work, prostitution, manual labour, forced begging and so on. Even in manufacturing, working conditions at factories contribute a lot to the problem by essentially turning employees into slaves. Prominent for workplace [violations](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/01/gap-walmart-factory-workers-exploited-and-abused-in-india) are factories that supply global multinationals like Walmart or Gap. They’ve been known to have working conditions that don’t just border on exploitation - but are miles away from that border, deep into exploitation territory. Complaints include non-payment of wages, forced overtime work, inability to form unions, extreme health consequences that may be fatal due to lack of safety regulations and even sexual harassment. How’s that 9-to-5 desk job sounding now?


**Follow The Money?**

In 2014, between the time when Modi was elected and the time when Modi was sworn-in as the PM, the Sensex was [up](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/narendra-modi-vs-bse-sensex/) 1,685 points. Clearly, the stock market loves Modi. But Modi thinks of the stock market as just a friend. Asset disclosures have [revealed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/pm-modi-top-ministers-stay-clear-of-stocks-keep-assets-in-realty-banks/articleshow/52413153.cms) that the PM has 79% of his total assets, which amount to a total of ₹26.1 lakh, in real estate and a big fat 0% in stocks. The stock market was friend-zoned not just by the PM, but by his cabinet as well. While the total assets of the top 9 ministers in the Indian government amounted to a staggering ₹91.1 crore, only 2% of them were invested in the stock market. The richest of the bunch was Arun Jaitley, perhaps appropriately the Finance Minister, who has total assets of ₹49.5 crore, a significant portion of which is just cold hard cash sitting as bank deposits. The poorest of the bunch was Suresh Prabhu, perhaps also appropriately the Railway Minister, who has total assets of mere ₹17 lakh. You want to talk about the gap between the rich and the poor? We’ve got that gap right here for you in government’s *navratnas*. 

**Time for Tim: Cook’s India Aftermath**

Tim came, Tim saw but Tim did not conquer. Tim Cook, Apple CEO, visited India a few weeks ago to much media fanfare and met several top government ministers. But to Tim’s disappointment, he failed to convince anyone to allow Apple to launch its famous retail iStores in India. Currently, Apple sells products through a network of dealers. That’s because under current regulations, if Apple wants to open retail stores, it needs to source 30% of content locally. Sourcing 30% locally means Apple would have to start manufacturing in India. Either that, or just buy stuff from local businesses and literally light it on fire. Neither of those things is about to happen. However, under current regulations, Apple can be granted a waiver to the 30% rule but only if Apple is bringing “cutting-edge” technology to India. And in the classic bureaucratic fashion, nobody actually bothered to define what “cutting-edge” would mean. And when you leave crucial terms like that open for interpretation, somewhere somehow a lawyer gets all excited. Now, Apple fanboys might disagree on this but government officials are unlikely to call any of Apple’s technology “cutting-edge” and are widely [expected](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/lDn53REhqvhqGoIxs9MgwJ/Apples-proposal-to-sell-refurbished-iPhones-in-India-reject.html) to decline Apple’s petition for a waiver of the 30% rule. The government is also not a big fan of Apple’s proposal to sell second-hand iPhones in India fearing that the country would become a graveyard for all old iPhones.

* Startups always describe themselves as the Google of this, or the Facebook of that, to the point that it’s become one of the annoying buzzwords of the startup world. While startups always envy such internet giants all year round, they didn’t last week. New rules imposing a levy (called the “Google Tax”) of 6% on anyone who does business of more than ₹1 lakh in a year with foreign online advertising services [kicked](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/corporates/article-google-tax-kicks-in-from-today-5-things-to-know-1414318) in from last week. And so it’s been a bad week for foreign online advertising services like Google or Facebook or Yahoo. But really, if you are Yahoo - every week is a bad week.

* Alright, hands up if you are happy at your job. I can’t really see you, but data says that 8.8 out of 10 people reading this are probably raising their hands right now. Turns out, all the Garfield-esque Monday back-to-work hate might just be a myth. The Edenred-Ipsos Barometer (that's a mouthful!), a yearly survey of well-being at work, has [ranked](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-opportunities/indian-employees-say-their-workplaces-promote-wellbeing/article8674930.ece) Indians at the top when it comes to having positive feelings about work. From 14,400 people in 15 countries, 88% of Indian employees report being satisfied about their work. So if you truly hate your job with a passion - you might be in the minority.

* People do crazy things for love? Try money. Questionable ponzi schemes have taken billions as investments by promoting impossible business ventures like tree plantations and even farming emus, the flightless bird. But here’s the thing with ponzi schemes - they seem to work, until one day they don’t. New legislation [proposed](http://qz.com/695185/finally-india-wants-to-clamp-down-on-savings-schemes-that-have-duped-investors-of-billions-of-dollars/) by the government aims to streamline the process for investigating ponzi schemes and to impose strict jail terms up to 10 years for offenders.
 
* Mahindra & Mahindra makes most of it’s money by selling trucks and tractors. And if you’re reading this, there’s a healthy chance that you’ve bought neither a truck, nor a tractor. The appeal of this series hasn’t gone that mainstream... yet. But just because the company mostly deals behind your back, it doesn’t mean the company isn’t making money. After [launching](http://www.financialexpress.com/auto/news/mahindra-q4-net-profit-jumps-14-4-on-better-uv-tractor-sales/269398/) nine products during the last fiscal year, net profit at M&M for the three months ending March was up 14% to ₹668 crore.

There’s a job that the Swiss Government wants all Swiss citizens to do. And it’s ready to shell out the big bucks. How big? ₹1.7 lakh per month. It offers decent hours, doesn’t need special training and isn’t dangerous. But Swiss citizens voted with an overwhelming majority and declined the job offer. Now that I have your attention, the job isn’t tiring or gross either. The job is ...to exist. Swiss citizens [voted](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36454060) down a universal income proposal that would guarantee a minimum income of ₹1.7 lakh/month to every Swiss citizen. Uninformed sources say, the government has decided to use that money to set up much needed mental health checkup facilities in the country.

The question can be related to any of 

Please specify the context of your question to get a clarity I shall respond soon.  



  
1. In November 1994, printing of 1 rupee notes was terminated predominantly due to the prohibitive cost of printing. As far as this goes, why does RBI want to put them in circulation again?  


  
If you have any such question then let me know. Will soon update after the meet

EDIT : 
  
Proof that I met him : [Raghuram Rajan's Autograph](http://imgur.com/bE58vPc)

He didn't answer all the questions but some if which he did answered are jotted down 
 
**Regarding PSU Banks**   

He says that large banks i.e the big players didn't want to have regulators for small banks and wanted to avoid that. But He (R_R) believed that they stand an equal chance as them and deserved to compete in the market. They need to be given opportunity to create a business and shape-up the economy.   
He quoted saying "" If they can't compete then don't deserve to exist ""  

**Regarding Bitcoin**  

RBI didn't fail to understand bitcoin, it just alarmed people that its highly volatile. He was quite fascinated by the innovation of bitcoin but at the same time believes that they can't replace the currency as over-regulation might happen anytime with it and you can't control it.   
He cited the example of movie ' GURU ' of how he tried to regulate the business but ended up failing to decide the future of what he was doing.  

*""It's a good innovation and the direction is right but need something more stable, and BITCOIN isn't the answer""*
   
**Regarding how is his communication with FM,PM and other institutes**

He jokingly answer it by telling *'using phone, emails, fax and letter'* but then told that there were certain discontent between them while deciding on policies and public matters of which  some results of the meeting weren't what he wanted.  

**On GST**

Lesser people pay tax-logistics but he believes GST will allow more people to pay the tax and improve efficiency

**His Advice to Youngsters** 

*""Challenge yourself. Don't Do boring stuff. If its interesting, Learn it. Don't be a master in one thing, move to other challenges once you master one thing, that will help you remain down to earth.""*  

**Asked him when he plans to join Quora**   
His reply - *What's Quora?*

I can't right all the things he mentioned but some of them which I felt would give the gist of what he meant is mentioned. 

  
P.S : I ain't from Finance background, I am an engineer. So pardon my finance jargon or something which you didn't understand, please let me know; will try to rectify it for understanding

Kharagpur.)_

Previous Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4xakjq/this_week_in_constitutional_law_i_part_i/

Link to Constitution of India: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India


Acronyms:
COI: Constitution of India
GOI: Government of India
UOI: Union of India


In the Friday class of last week we had an elaborate discussion on the what
constitutes a state under Article 12 under COI. As discussed in last post,
Article 12 says.


> In this Part, unless the context otherwise required, ""the State"" includes the
> Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of
> each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of
> India or under the control of the Government of India.

Last time we discussed how definition here is context dependent. You should
also notice that it say """"the State"" includes"", that means the definition is
not limited to the items provided in the list and it can be expanded depending
on the interpretation. The list is:

* The Government
* Parliament of India
* The legislature and Government of each of the States
* Local Authorities
* Other Authorities

Interpretation of government, parliament and legislature as they are defined
within the constitution and definition of local authorities is to be
interpreted with respect to to General Clauses Act 1897 as mentioned in Article
367 of COI. There are two things to notice here, first is that the list doesn't
mention Judiciary. Our professor mentioned that there is much debate about
interpreting judiciary as ""state"" in Article 12, but he didn't give much
details. The other thing is that ""Other Authorities"" is not defined and over
the course of time our courts have used this to expand the scope of fundamental
rights considerably by bringing more and institutions under scope of Part III
by interpreting them as ""Other Authorities"".

One of the first cases that raised that tried to interpret ""other authorities""
in Article 12 are _[University of Madras vs Shantha
Bai](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/233848/)_ which came to Madras High Court in
1954 and _[B W Devadas vs Karnataka Engineering
College](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1084632/)_ which came to Karnataka High
Court in 1963. To interpret these cases the court used the principle of
""ejusdem generis"" which says that a general word should be interpreted in the
light of specific words which it follows. For example if I say ""apple, banana,
orange, etc"", then pineapple can be interpreted as ""etc"" but not cricket bat.
In other words there should be common thread running between the specific words
and whatever we interpret as the general word.

In these cases the court said that all the specific authorities mentioned are
involved in discharging sovereign functions. Sovereign functions are functions
which can only be discharged by State and not by any private entity, for
example, managing foreign relations, levying taxes and maintain law and order.
Since the authorities in question are universities and since the function of
imparting education is not a sovereign function, universities cannot be
considered state under ""other authorities"".

The first case that came to supreme court in this regard is the case of
_[Rajasthan Electricity Board vs Mohan
Lal](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/459864/)_ in 1967. It was an employment
related issue where Mohan Lal claimed that the action of 
Board is unconstitutional under Article 14 (Equality before Law) and Article 16
(Equality of Opportunity in matters of public employment) of COI.

The Electricity Board, citied the principle of ""ejusdem genesis"" and said it
has been created to carry out commercial activity of distributing electricity,
which is not a governmental activity, hence it is not state under Article 12.
The court rejected the principle of ""ejusdem genesis"" and used the dictionary
meaning of the word ""Authority"". Court said:

_""[Authority is] ""a public administrative agency or corporation having quasi-
governmental powers and authorised to administer a revenue- producing public
enterprise."" ... The expression ""other authorities"" is wide enough to include
within it every authority created by a statute and functioning within the
territory of India, or under the control of the Government of India""_

Since Rajasthan Electricity Board was created through a statue it should
considered a state

Justice Shah gave the same judgement with a different reasoning, he said

_""The State Electricity Board has the power of promoting coordinated
development, generation supply and distribution of electricity and for that
purpose is invested by the State with extensive powers of control over
electricity undertakings, The power to make rule and regulations and to
administer the Act is in substance the sovereign power of the State delegated
to the Board.""_

In the subsequent case of _[Sukhdev vs Bhagat
Rao](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/426032/)_ Justice Matthew highlighted that
the function of the state is to provide welfare to the people and is not
limited to performing sovereign functions. The case involved three public
cooperations Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, the Life Insurance Corporation
and the Industrial Finance Corporation. He said that these corporates are
**instruments** of the state to carry out business of public importance.
Whatever is the method through which these corporates came about, creations of
corporates should not decrease the responsibility of state. Hence these should
be considered ""state"" under Article 12.

~fin~",,Indian Startups Last Week: 21st Nov - 27th Nov,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5f51sj/indian_startups_last_week_21st_nov_27th_nov/
1441733739.0,6,24,22,"I write this knowing that Modi supporters seriously lack understanding of the lending business,economics and business in general  and will probably make some half-assed excuse for the 75000 crore bailout but lets look at some figures.  But this needs to be said in light of todays FM meeting which will used to further bailout these idiots in corporate India who have used public money and in return just done what they have always done - misuse the capital. Not to mention are trying to force Rajan to cut interest rates to save their own ass despite savers siginficantly suffering in the last 3-4 years due to negative real interest reducing India's savings signifcantly and forcing people into risk assets like equities, (which are incidentally now down 13% from the top).

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS - Savings % gdp.

China's corporate debt to GDP is around 160% of GDP. 

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/chinas-corporate-debt-at-160-of-gdp-twice-us-level/articleshow/48141056.cms

India's corporate debt - taking into account private sector lending growth is around 53.8% . (Based on 2014 figures and credit growth).

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FS.AST.PRVT.GD.ZS

China has 3x the loan as a % of gdp. Yet has 4x lower NPA on its banks balance sheets. And despite that its banks are facing a debt crisis.  It too has implemented a lot of basel 3 norms which started around 2013 (an excuse used by Modi supporters to justify restructuring when in reality India already employs capital adequacy rations which basel 3 is has asked to be implemented by 2018 making the implementation irrelevant). Even if you take into account China's shadow banking industry its still much lower. 

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FB.AST.NPER.ZS/countries?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&sort=asc

The reason I mentioned China is because China's growth most of which has come in the last 15 years going from a 1.7 trillion economy in the year 2000, to a 10 trillion economy was not driven by FDI as most pundits in India would have believe. But by a massive expansion in credit and therefore investment . Something to the tune $40 trillion dollars. This has led to what many believe its a massive credit crisis resulting for mal-investment, and the root cause of the asset bubbles around China. Not to mention the slowdown of economy.

Latest figures show India's NPA's stood at 5.3 percent. 

http://www.livemint.com/Industry/PSkRuIxPOtkZBDECcgTHIK/Allout-efforts-on-to-bring-down-PSU-banks-NPA-Jaitley.html

So what does this tell us? 

1. Massive amount of corruption in lending especially by PSU's.
2. A small percentage of Indians mostly a few big wigs and politically connected people continue to avail loans without any significant collateral, and when they can't pay back these loans the politicians just help the restructure loans.

How times will the tax payers have to bailout these banks? Even if we do bail them out this time which we have. How long before we are at the same place again. People say oh we will implement basel 3.  But let me ask you this, India already implements most of the capital adequacy standards asked for in Basel 3 so what will basel 3 do?

All this is crony capitalism of the highest standard. 

And now with the latest meeting happening today in the finance. The corporate sleazeballs have asked for their NPA's to be restructured under a separate vehicle known as the restructure bank so 'lending can start again'. 

What really needs to be done and will never be done because the corporate 'honchos' which the fiscal hawks that Modi supporters are in awe of, continue to use PSU banks as their own piggy bank. Of course a lack of backlash because of blind supporters means nothing going to change.

In reality whats needs to be done is no restructuring and bailouts but real changes.

1.Privatise all PSU banks.

2. Create a watchdog which is independent like the RBI to oversee lending standards. 

3.Implement stronger lending standard with internetional standards to account for fraud, and international models which banks like JP morgan etc use when they lend.

Again I don't see this happening. Caravan just published an article (on Ruai's but its all the same anyway) which shows how audacious the Adanis' and Ambanis are. And how they constantly just get more and more money every year.  Meanwhile I don't expect Modi supporters to ever go against their dear leader .

So enjoy paying taxes and saving with PSU's only for your money to directed towards crony capitalism.

1505582001.0,6,13,24,"[Articles such as this one](http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/do-engineers-have-an-advantage-in-cat-here-s-busting-all-myths/story-xJtJ7YMldPiDokQlU6bk7M.html) blatantly dismiss CAT's bias towards engineers as a myth. I'm fairly certain that the level of mathematics is that of 6th - 10th grades.


[This article](http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1952) seems to make more sense.


Moreover, NRIs who take admission in Indian engineering colleges receive the shock of their lives when they see that their fellow batchmates are already quite familiar with concepts of calculus that the SAT does not test at all. As a result, many of these students end up failing math in their first semester and might even begin a downward spiral due to depression.


Every year I keep hearing talks of IIMs wanting to be more like foreign b-schools where majority of the batch does not hail from an engineering background, but from commerce/business backgrounds. But it's not just about MBA programs. Even the batch profile of the Msc Finance program at JBIMS reveals that out of the 30 students it takes in, majority have engineering background.


I appeared for the interview at JBIMS. I'm a BBA - Finance grad and was asked what subjects I studied in BBA. I told them the subjects (Management accounting, strategic financial managemnt, etc.) and they countered asking, ""If you have already studied these subjects in graduation, why do you want to study them again in post grad?"". And here I thought that it would make more sense for business and commerce grads to pursue an MFin because that is much more coherent than jumping over to MFin from engineering.

###Headline Stories

**Killing Tax Havens - One Treaty At A Time**

Question - What country ranks second in the share of foreign portfolio investments made in the Indian stock market? Answer - First of all, that is a very specific question to ask. And second of all, if you [answered](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-12/news/73039798_1_tax-treaty-capital-gains-tax-mauritius) Mauritius, give yourself a pat on the back. It’s not that ~~Martian~~ Mauritian citizens are crazy about Indian stocks, Mauritius is just an island that is even smaller than Mumbai and Delhi put together. It’s that investments made through Mauritius were exempt from Indian capital gains taxes - which essentially transformed Mauritius into a tax haven. It was all legal under a 30-year old treaty between the two countries that was signed in 1983. Ahh, the 1980s - when the Panama Papers wasn’t a thing, the accountants didn’t have to worry about ethics, and writing physical letters was actually cool and not just hipster cool. But all that and more is changing. Under an amendment to the treaty that was [agreed](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/u4AzTTKA5vCRJBWhANkuZN/Some-FAQs-on-the-Mauritius-tax-treaty.html) upon last week, India will begin imposing a capital gains tax on all future investments made through the country. This gives existing investors some wiggle room, and doesn’t trigger a crash in case existing investors decide to pull out.


**Raghu’s Second Term**

Time flies when you’re having fun, and it’s already time for another governor at the RBI. Current governor Raghuram Rajan’s term is about to end in September and there’s some awkward tension in the air about his reappointment since Rajan’s crusade against bad loans is expected to be done by March 2017, a full 6 months after his term expires. Chosen under former PM Manmohan Singh’s administration, Rajan [says](http://www.businessinsider.in/RBIs-Raghuram-Rajan-keeps-mum-about-second-term-but-reveals-his-backup-plan/articleshow/52185985.cms) he hasn’t been asked if he wants to continue as governor and intends to go back to teaching when he’s done. He can act as coy as he wants, but everyone knows that he wants to continue as governor. Who wouldn’t? It’s like asking an olympic gold winner if he’d like to continue winning the gold. However, the newest member of the Rajya Sabha, Subramanian Swamy, has [stated](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/send-raghuram-rajan-back-to-chicago-subramanian-swamys-new-attack-1405498) that Rajan is unsuitable to run the RBI and shouldn’t be reappointed. Swamy says that Rajan should instead pack up his bags and go to the US, where he is a professor at the University of Chicago. ‘Go back to (insert country here)’ seems to be a recurring theme lately.

**EPF Changes: Strike Three?**

At first they tried to tax your EPF withdrawals. But that didn’t work out. Then, they tried to restrict EPF withdrawals until you’re 58. But that didn’t work out either. Now, they are back. And this time, they want to help you buy a house. A new scheme currently under discussion would [allow](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/epfo-members-to-benefit-as-govt-plans-low-cost-housing-scheme-for-over-5-cr-subscribers/251510/) you to pledge future EPF contributions as installments towards buying a house. Here’s how it would work: You go out and try to find your ultimate dream house. You give up and settle on one that your wife likes, because you just want to get this over with. Then you find a bank that doesn’t think you’re Mallya 2.0 and gives you a home loan. And now, your future EPF contributions can count as installments on the home loan. But you also have to be a low-income first-time home buyer to qualify. The last two times any modifications to the EPF system have been proposed, they have backfired. If this were baseball, the batter is already two strikes down and might end up with a strikeout, if this backfires as well.

**Numbers You Don’t Want To Hear**

The kryptonite of any agrarian economy is a prolonged drought. Like the one we’ve been having in over 10 states for the past two years now. A recent study [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/rs-650000-crore-thats-the-impact-the-drought-will-have-on-the-indian-economy-says-assocham/) the total impact of that drought on the national economy at ₹6,50,000 crore. That number is so huge, your brain is incapable of processing it. That’s because a loss of ₹100 is a tragedy, a loss of ₹100 crore is a statistic. Moving on to some much lighter news - the Indian banking [system](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/its-that-bad-if-you-pay-rs-150-for-a-bank-stock-rs-50-is-going-as-bad-loan/articleshow/52291846.cms) is on fire. If you spend ₹150 on buying stock in the average Indian bank right now - you’d be spending ₹50 just to purchase the bad loans that come with the bank. The skeletons could’ve stopped tumbling out at any point - but what’s the fun in that? New estimates show that the amount of bad loans in the Indian banking system might be greater than the entire economy of New Zealand. Little reminder - In statistics, you can either pick the data and write the story it supports, or you can pick the story and write the data that supports it.

* You know the usual startup story - work in a big MNC, then quit to join a startup to forge your own path and find success. Turns out, joining a startup is more like wooing a girl - promises are made, expectations are built but when you take the jump, the reality is nowhere near what was promised. A lot of senior executives from startups like Flipkart, Ola and what have you are [jumping](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/why-senior-executives-are-quitting-startups-to-move-back-to-traditional-established-companies/articleshow/52197572.cms) ship to go work at traditional, established companies.

* Planning is always tricky. Exhibit A: My entire life. But planning how to run an entire country is infinitely trickier. Just by playing around with your targets and durations, you can plan to win or plan to fail. The government has [replaced](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/five-year-plans-out-15-year-vision-soon-116051300041_1.html) the famous Nehruvian 5-year plan system that set targets for economic and social growth with a more comprehensive 15-year vision that is broken up into 2 development agendas to be reviewed every 3 years. 

* A Sardar and a Chinese walk into a bar in Shanghai. Sounds like the beginning of a very bad joke? Might just be the beginning of a very unusual partnership. The Punjab government has partnered with the municipal commission of Shanghai where the Chinese will [provide](http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/sukhbir-badal-in-shanghai-china-offers-agri-tech-transfer-to-punjab-for-boosting-diversification-drive/story-2cfVPAlLXifFYqFncaoV3N.html) technology to farmers in Punjab and help the government rejuvenate a state-owned milk brand among other things. Chinese investors have also [committed](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Chinese-investors-to-pump-in-50-million-in-Punjab-Sukhbir/articleshow/52229952.cms) over $50 million in potential investments in the state.

* Nestle India [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/nestle-q1-net-slips-19-at-rs-259-cr-maggi-noodles-hurt-sales_6640361.html) earnings for the first quarter of the year - profits down almost 20%. The company’s most famous brand, Maggi is back on shelves and has already recaptured more than 50% of the market share in the instant noodles segment. But as many could testify even before today, sometimes a majority is just not enough.

Saga of the Panama Papers continues. The organization that received the millions of leaked documents detailing offshore companies in Panama has put it all online in a neat little searchable database.

And it’s working - property tax collections are up 20% since the city began innovating its tax collection methods. It’s effective because if drummers start playing outside your house, you reputation in the community takes a hit. After all, *chaar log dekhenge to kya kahenge?*

*“There is a probability that people may not spend the money and save it thereby not contributing to growth""* - Raghuram Rajan [criticizing](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/economy/article-raghuram-rajan-questions-helicopter-money-says-people-may-not-spend-1404047) ‘helicopter money’. Yes, everyone wishes that term meant money literally being dropped from helicopters. Or helicopter origami made out of currency notes. But it just means central banks printing money and giving it directly to the people by investing in public projects to spur growth and spending.

**No Money? No Problem**

No Problem for the banks that loaned you the money - big problems for you. The Lok Sabha just [passed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-bankruptcy-idUSKCN0XS1NW) the landmark Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Currently, we use a patchwork of laws that govern bankruptcies in India. That patchwork has resulted in 70,000 pending cases of bankruptcies. But the new bill sets a deadline of 180 days after the business defaults on loans during which the business owners and the lenders have to reach a resolution. Failing a resolution, the lenders can then sell the business to recover dues. This country is slowing moving to a market-based economy ever since the fall of the Soviet Union. And capitalism without bankruptcy is like christianity without hell. An interesting recommendation that could end up in the law seeks to ban bankrupt people from contesting in elections. Wonder if there was any specific person that inspired this recommendation. You know, a specific person who was a businessman and a politician but also went bankrupt while receiving excessive media coverage coinciding with a time when a lot of the banks are dealing with bad loans? (*cough cough* Vijay Mallya).

**A Democratic RBI**

Currently, the RBI functions like a dictatorship with the governor being the supreme leader. Basically, while sitting in his pajamas, Raghuram Rajan can make major changes that could either launch the economy into the future or turn the economy upside down. And nobody can do anything about it. But now the Finance Bill which just [passed](http://qz.com/676943/indias-bullet-proof-central-bank-is-about-to-get-another-layer-of-armour/) the Lok Sabha and is expected to pass the Rajya Sabha as well will turn the RBI into a quasi-democracy. The bill seeks to replace the current system with a six-member panel with three representatives from the government and three from the RBI. The panel will vote on the changes to be made and Rajan will be given the tie-breaker vote. No wonder Rajan is all for the new system because one, most major central banks do it this way, two, centralized power just hasn’t work out well historically and three, in case of terrible outcomes - just point to the panel for all the blame and in case of great outcomes - bask in the glory of all the history books and mainstream media credit as the governor of the RBI.

**Flopkart**

(That title was so obvious, it had to be used.) What’s the most important law of nature? No, it’s not ‘people who wear crocs don’t get laid’. It’s the law of gravity. What goes up must come down. Just a few years ago, Flipkart was the hot new thing on the startup scene. But now competition in the space is heating up. Starting just a few months ago, minority investors in Flipkart have begun to [slash](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/more-investors-mark-down-flipkart-valuation-116050400523_1.html) the value of their shares in Flipkart. In February, Morgan Stanley marked its investments in Flipkart down by 27%. Last month, T-Rowe Price marked its investments down by 15%. And now, Fidelity and Valic slashed the value of their investments by more than 20%. It’s not just Flipkart. HSBC [published](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/zomato-demicorn/) a report that basically says Zomato is worth only half of what people say it’s worth. Is this what it felt like in 2000 just before the startup bubble popped? Zomato, which is thought to be a unicorn (a startup worth a billion dollars) might just be a demicorn (a startup worth half a billion - trademark pending). 

**The Singh Bros of Ranbaxy**

They say you should never hide information from your doctors and lawyers. Add one more to that list - a Japanese corporation that’s buying a majority stake in your business. The Singh brothers, ex-promoters of pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy Laboratories, are finding out just what happens when you cross that line. In 2008, the Singh bros sold a majority stake in Ranbaxy to the Japanese corporation, Daiichi-Sankyo (with an appropriately Japanese name too). But they allegedly, hid information from Daiichi that Ranbaxy was adulterating drugs that were made in India and sold in the US. They were caught in 2013, and Daiichi-owned Ranbaxy had to pay $500 million in damages. Since Daiichi had no idea that Ranbaxy was involved in these shady dealings when it bought a majority stake in 2008, it sued the Singh brothers for hiding that information. An arbitration panel last week found the Singh brothers guilty and [asked](http://www.wsj.com/articles/former-ranbaxy-owners-ordered-to-pay-385-million-to-daiichi-sankyo-1462473046) them to pay $385 million to Daiichi as damages. That’s got to be a bitter pill to swallow.

* Thank god for politicians. Savour the joy of reading those words in one sentence because it’s probably not happening again. But whenever there are elections and politicians hit the road to campaign for votes, they seem to kickstart the country’s industrial sector. The core sector output which is an Index of 8 Core Industries [went](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/core-sector-output-rises-6-4-in-march-thanks-to-politicians/articleshow/52158936.cms) up by 6.4% in March, just before states begin voting in April.

* What comes to your mind when you picture the typical Indian farmer? A skinny, frail and rural fellow struggling to make ends meet? Perhaps, the male version of that old woman in Swades standing behind a lightbulb that goes “Bijli”? Well, you’d be right most of the time but not all. Some farmers actually do pretty well for themselves. Data from the agricultural census [says](http://scroll.in/article/807603/failure-of-reforms-5-of-indias-farmers-own-a-third-of-the-land) just 5% of the farmers own over 30% of India’s farmland.

* India’s leading tobacco company, ITC cannot make up its mind. Due to a new rule requiring cigarette manufacturers to cover 85% of the packaging in pictorial warnings, ITC had previously shut down factories in protest. And later resumed production.

And then, of course, resumed production within 48 hours. Frankly, people are going to be disappointed if they don’t do the same thing next week.

* Tata Steel’s UK business has been underwater for a long time now. And the lungs are about to give up and flood water. Unless someone throws in a lifebuoy. And that someone might be Sanjeev Gupta, an Indian-origin businessman, who is [bidding](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/00a3b3c6-0fae-11e6-839f-2922947098f0.html#axzz48DXOYxhZ) to acquire Tata Steel UK. The second best contender is a buyout from Tata UK’s own management team, but it seems like the captain might not have to go down with the ship after all.

**The Rain Gods Want Beer And IPL**

Maharashtra is suffering from a major drought, which is a big deal because hospitals in the severely hit areas have had to cancel operations due to water shortages. It’s so bad that SS* President Uddhav Thackeray has [asked](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/maharashtra-drought-water-crisis-latur-govt-should-stop-water-supply-to-beer-units-in-view-of-drought-shiv-sena-chief-2756485/) the government to stop supplying water to breweries in the state. There’s more. The Mumbai High Court has also [ordered](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36038026) 13 IPL Cricket matches to move out of the state (cricket matches use up a ton of water). You know it’s bad when they go after cricket and beer. The rain gods got a wind of what was happening and have decided to stop the madness before riots break out. The Indian Meteorological Department, which predicts rainfalls among other things, has [predicted](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Economy-set-for-boost-as-Met-forecasts-above-normal-monsoon/articleshow/51802516.cms) “above normal” rainfall this year that may break the two-year long drought and help revive a weak farm economy. Take it with a grain of salt since these are only predictions but they have been supported by two private forecasters as well.

*Shiv Sena, not the Nazis.

**Some Good Numbers**

Several agencies just unloaded a big data dump and while the data isn’t always good, this time it is. Consumer Price Inflation [slowed](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/retail-price-inflation-slows/article8467622.ece) to 4.83% in March, the lowest it has been in 6 months. The price declines were led by the ‘food and beverage’ segment. Who doesn’t love cheap food? Industrial Output broke a 3-month negative streak to grow by 2% in February while electricity production grew by 10% in the same month. All those foreign tours are paying off - despite a decrease from 2014 numbers, recent numbers show India as the world’s largest remittance recipient in 2015 after NRIs [sent](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/India-is-top-remittance-recipient-of-2015-World-Bank/articleshow/51822766.cms) back $69 billion (₹459,988 crore) to families in India. Economists around the country are calling it the “Karan Johar effect”. But that also works the other way around - outward remittances from India grew by over 300% to reach $499 million (₹3,326 crore). Although bank deposits grew by 10%, it’s the slowest growth rate since 1963. But that could also indicate increased consumer spending which can be good for the economy - depends on if you’re a glass half-full or half-empty kind of person.

**No Smoking - Part 2**

Part 1 Recap: The size of the pictorial health warnings that go over cigarette packets was increased from 20% to 85%. Confusion over the decision prompted cigarette manufacturers including ITC ([ITC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AITC)) to shut down all cigarette factories in protest. And now…

Part 2: Turns out - all that drama was over nothing. Cigarette manufacturers, having realized that the government can stay adamant longer than they can stay in business, have decided to [resume](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/itc-to-resume-cigarette-manufacturing/story/231126.html) cigarette manufacturing. But that doesn’t mean the end of this saga. While the mainstream cigarette brands have resumed production, now the traditional cigarette makers that make *beedis*, have [shut](http://in.reuters.com/article/tobacco-industry-supreme-court-appeal-idINKCN0XB1H6) down production because the “wrapping paper edges prevent printing on a reasonably large area of the curved surface”. The beedi industry employs more than 8.8 million Indians mostly in rural impoverished areas, who might be temporarily out of a job. A lawsuit challenging the size increase has already made its way to the Supreme Court which is set to hear the case on April 22nd.

Stay tuned for Part 3 - Coming Soon.

**TCS’s US Troubles**

A grand jury in the United States has [held](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/tcs-denies-ip-infringement-will-appeal-940-million-jury-award-in-us-trade-secrets-theft-case/articleshow/51855594.cms) Tata Consultancy Services ([TCS](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATCS)) in violation of copyright and intellectual property laws and asked the company to pay a fine of $940 million (₹6,266 crore). In October 2014, Epic Systems, an American healthcare software provider, filed a lawsuit accusing TCS of stealing trade secrets, confidential information and more than 6,000 secret documents in order to improve its own competing product called ‘Med Mantra’. And now, the jury has found that TCS did indeed do all those things. TCS, part of the Tata Group known for its integrity and ethics, has denied all allegations. Cheap ripoffs of Western products and brands is usually China’s ball game. But hey, if it works, why not? Except this time, it turned out to be not so cheap - $940 million is close to half of Epic Systems annual revenue.

**Greybull Capital To The Rescue!**

Tata Steel ([TATASTEEL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATATASTEEL)), after a year of intensive searching has found a scapegoat that’s willing to buy a part of its loss-making UK operations. The company is [selling](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/tatas-sell-uk-unit-to-greybull-for-1/235275/) a part of its failing business in the UK to private equity investor Greybull Capital (not to be confused with Red Bull, provider of wings). You don’t really understand the extent to which the Tatas were desperate until you hear that the UK business was sold for just a nominal sum of £1 (94 rupees) and the current pension obligations for employees will still stay with the Tatas. The search for buyers for the remaining parts of the business is still on. However, this has not scared the company off Europe in any way. Tata Steel was [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tata-steel-thyssenkrupp-idINKCN0XA0F0) to be in talks with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp (thi-sen-krup) to merge their European businesses under a joint venture.

1517926185.0,6,0,3,"> ""The Sensex and Nifty suffered a bloodbath today, tracking a selloff in global equity markets. Overnight, the Wall Street suffered its biggest intraday decline in history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with a loss of about 1,200 points - nearly 4.6 percent. Shares in other Asian markets were also under strong selling pressure, with Japan's Nikkei down about 5 percent. The Sensex fell as much over 1,200 points to 33,482 while Nifty tumbled below 10,300. The rupee also fell to 64.38 against US dollar, as compared to Monday's close of 64.06.""


* The trigger for the latest global selloff is Friday's job data in US, which showed American wages increasing at the fastest pace since 2009. This has raised alarm about higher inflation and with it potentially higher interest rates.

* In anticipation of the faster-than-expected rate hike from the Federal Reserve - the US central bank, bond yields have spiked in the US, undermining the attraction of equities. Higher bond yields are also seen as negative for emerging markets and commodity prices.

*  Though Finance minister Mr. Arun Jaitley Killed Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency but showed their interest in Blockchain technology, people still likely to [understand all in & Out of Cryptocurrency](https://www.eduonix.com/complete-steemit-course-earn-cryptocurrency-for-free?coupon_code=edu15) as well as interested to purchase it 

* The US central bank had last month kept interest rate unchanged but said inflation would likely rise this year, raising the possibility faster-than-expected rate hikes.

* On the other hand, [global oil prices have dropped](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/business-30691883/why-are-global-oil-prices-falling) amid recent dollar strength, with international benchmark Brent futures hitting a one-month low of $66.90 per barrel earlier this week. A fall in global oil prices is seen as positive for India as the country imports bulk of its requirement.

* Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday attributed the downslide in the local bourses to selloff in global markets. ""It is not due to the Budget or the LTCG (long-term capital gains tax),"" he said.

* Apart from the global selloff, the domestic sentiment has been hit by the Budget announcement of 10 percent tax on long-term capital gains accrued from equity investments, say, analysts. The Sensex fell over 800 points on Friday and over 300 points on Monday.

* The Street would also be closely watching [Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy stance](https://www.ndtv.com/business/rbi-seen-taking-tough-stance-on-inflation-in-monetary-policy-review-1808713) tomorrow.

1480542366.0,6,11,13,"What is Participatory Note?
Participatory notes are not mere instruments used by Pakistan to invest in our economy. Modi says he goes to a lot of foreign countries  to bring in Foreign Investment.

Out of such Foreign Investments, the highest a country has invested is not US or the UK or France or Germany or any other major country but a tiny island called Mauritius. 

A small Island off Indian Ocean whose total population would be about 12 L! Mauritius has invested more than 40% in India. 

Many other such islands like Cayman islands etc exist. How did such islands get such huge money to invest in India and who exactly are those people? Whose money is it anyways? 

That money is none other than the illegal stash of the Indian crony capitalists! The money starts from India and goes on a sight seeing trip across many countries and finally gets to Mauritius - which then finds its way back to India as Foreign Investment!

If the illegal money that is in circulation in India is Jeevatma, the illegal money circulating around the globe is Paramatma - in the language the BJP folk can understand!

Jeevatma becomes one with the Paramatma, this indian sewer water gets mixed with International sewer waters, then when it comes back to India again via Mauritius, it is the Pure Virgin Ganges water or Foreign Investment - Modi will do snanam and worship it and welcome it with folded hands!

The very same black money that they say they are trying to eradicate, has come back as Foreign Investment, and it gets lots of subsidies when it comes back to India!

So who's taking it away to Foreign countries? How do they take it?Let's for a moment forget TATA, Birla, Ambani, Adani etc, among the fat cats there are individual fat cats like our ministers - yes Ministers! Many of these Ministers who do not even have a  standard education have property in foreign countries, coal, iron ore factories abroad and even whole islands in their names! Some of it has come out in the newspapers too!

People like Adani sell solar electricity to states and these ministers make a huge cut out of it. But do they get bribes in a sack and then carry it abroad? No, they just show a benami name and a property will be bought in that name or money transferred in his HSBC bank! So next this minister or that benami comes back as Foreign Investor!

Many of our ministers go on trips to such islands like Cayman Islands - does Modi not know of this? Will Modi ask all of his ministers to submit their travel itinerary for the period they have been in power for audit? 

Let's take an example: The Central Board of Excise and Customs, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence has given a report - 'a scam involving companies inflating the value of coal imports from Indonesia for their power plants thus siphoning money abroad. Initial estimates by the agency pegged the overvaluation at Rs 29,000 crore in the period 2011-2014.'

How did this scam happen? If we had purchased directly from Indonesia, a tonne of coal cost $50. However, it was handed over to other brokers and middlemen aka crony capitalists to purchase it. Coal is still in Indonesia - but it changes hands to 7-8 different countries on paper alone! So when it comes back to India it costs $87! 

So multiply 37 * 70 for a tonne. It involves states Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Kerala! Each state has lost about 1500 Cr due to this scam.

The culprits include state parties and its minister in this along with Adani, Ambani, Ruia, Jindal, India cements etc. Adani has gained 6000 Cr illegally by supplying industrial parts for Gujarat State Electricity Ltd according to Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.

Modi travelled all over India during his election campaign using Adani's Jet. Its behind Adani's money that  Modi was able to fund his political campaign!

He travelled with same Adani to Australia to get him permission for mining rights. Just this Nov 18, Adani was given 6000 cr loan for the same Australia mining project!

Can Directorate of Revenue Intelligence ask why coal sold at $50 was sold at $87 - even if they ask they'll say it is business practice - Standard Operating Procedure! Its perfectly legal and cannot be questioned in court too!

All those companies that changed hands in the process just exist in letter pads! Benami Companies! So DRI cannot do anything about this illegal money and all these companies have understanding with the countries where they are stored - so they wont ask and even if they ask it will fizzle out!

So when the govt itself is supporting this washing of Black Money to White through such routes, where does the question of catching the Black Money arise?

Atleast here coal was bought and 29000 cr lost, but there are examples where such operations have taken place in paper alone!

There is another such Island Bahamas whose population is 3.5L only. In 2008, export from India is $ 22,00,000. In 2010 it grew to $ 280,00,000. What do you think that this 3.5 Lakh people bought from India? What was being exported from India? Two companies have done it - Reliance & Essar - petroleum has been exported. Even if the 3.5 Lakh people drive around 24*7 and eat drink and shit petrol, they can't possibly use such a huge amount of petrol as was being exported! So there you go!

This was not just carried out by Ambani's but by Reddy brothers - who swallowed the Bellari, who were powerful to move the state border of karnataka into Andhra! Such efficient people - Sushma Swaraj's disciples! They have exported very high quality iron ore - how much? From the ports the reports says 5000 shiploads have been exported. But Excise has reports only 4000 shiploads. What happened to the remaining 1000 shiploads? Where is the revenue from it? Where has it been invested?

Doesn't Modi know all this?

So Black Money is not something in a hidden box which you can go and collect it and bring it back and deposit Rs. 15,00,000 in everyone's account.  Its about handling black money practices - as we've seen above they've devised ways to make such black money laudering routes and practices as legal. This incidentally has happened more during BJP rule. No its not a biased statement.

According to World Bank report during the period 1998 - 2004, it was during the vajpayee rule that such black money practices and black money has flourished to the maximum extent in India. Now you can understand why the news came in today about BJP leading the parties in income from unknown sources. 

In 2011, after scams such as 2G etc started surfacing, Advani started a Rath Yathra against Corruption and Black Money, saying there are 70 Lakh Crores of Black Money stashed abroad, I'll bring it back"". Advani was held up as the iron Man - Lauh Purush - as if he'll act like a superman bomb all illegal stashes abroad and bring all black money back but he was bombed by Modi in 2014 who took over his role and got involved with Anna Hazare etc and personally making gullible statements to fool people about 15 L for each account.

However, during UPA rule, in a very important case for Black money, the tax evasion case by Vodafone, the SC ruled that we cannot demand such tax from them. After that, when Pranab Mukherjee brought in rules to avoid such malpractices namely, GAAR - General Anti Avoidance Rules, the person who spoke vociferously against it and did not allow it was none other than our present FM Arun Jaitlee! Not just FM but all the corporates and crony capitalists were against bringing in this rule!

During UPA rule, the BJP asked Congress to bring out names of Swiss Bank holders in Parliament. Pranab Mukherjee ridiculed them in Parliament. Swiss Banks are not giving out names, shall we send the Army? BJP kept quiet and then turned it as if Congress is not giving out names. Today, when BJP is in power, Modi is giving the same answer to SC!

Now, BJP is not keen about money stashed abroad. So they turned their attention towards internal black money (Jeevatma, remember?) So doesn't Modi know who are the kingpins involved? Ok if you don't know who can find it out - Income Tax, Enforcement directorate, Revenue Intelligence, CBI, Finance Ministry are at his disposal! So what are those departments doing?

Either they are in the payrolls of such kingpins or you all have decided not to act on them. So this whole system is nothing but a farce!

So now Modi is trying to bring Black Money out of ordinary people - who have never seen such huge amount of money as quoted in this post - let alone black money! Modi has brought in an emergency situation and panicked the people. Just before this demonetisation, Modi met and discussed with 3 chiefs of Army Navy & Airforce. Why? Because, he feared a civil unrest and wanted to avoid it. This Army has not been sent against the kingpins of black money but if the ordinary people are put to much hardships they know it will lead to outcry and want to avoid it and have taken measures for that.

After doing all this, the BJP representatives when asked if by removing 500 & 1000 notes will BM be curbed, on talk shows they are saying ""We never said anything like that. This is a step towards curbing black money.""

So why such a drastic measure has been thrust on the common man? There's a reason for their activity. Its not about Black Money or Fake Money but totally irrelevant to it!

1480516375.0,6,32,26,"Hi

I am stuck in a bad situation and I was hoping you could help me by guiding me on what to do or pointing to someone who could maybe guide me

**What I need help with** : Choosing a path to land a job as soon as possible

**What my problem is :** Was an entrepreneur for 3 years - I have only generalist skills, no employable skills. And I dont have money saved up. 

Some histroy -

I'm an Engineer with an MBA in Banking and Finance [Finished mba  2 years back from a top-12 college in India]. Right out of college I landed a job as a business analyst at a good IT firm [not Infosys/tcs etc] but I didn’t join that company and instead went into the family business.


Since  early 2014, I have been working for my 3 family businesses and done all sorts of general-ish stuff [One's a new school, another an industrial equipment manufacturing factory and the the third is a construction firm making residential apartments]


* in 2014, Worked towards planning, execution, purchase related stuff of construction of our school - involved dealing with suppliers, contractors etc


* In 2015, Worked in day to day planning, execution, management of our industrial manufacturing unit. Did lot of touring for this, to build better relationship with our clients and suppliers. I have experience of B2B marketing, building and maintaining client and supplier relationships etc]


* In 2016, in the construction firm, I oversaw and completed a small residential project and involved in a lot of aspects. Ive gone abroad in exhibitions and done B2C marketing, involved in sales and marketing department, designing/tweaking online ad campaigns, decision making for local sales channels like hoardings etc, supervision of day to day work on construction site etc. I believe I have a baisc working knowledge of the construction industry now.

However, now I am looking for a job since I haven’t earned anything in the past 3 years. **I cant take money from my family now due to a complicated situation. I am completely on my own** ,  There are no future earning prospects from the business for me, and my only way to survive is by taking up a job. Unfortunately, I don’t have any employable skills. I just don’t know what to do.


**I need a path to a job.** What is something I can do to land a job as quickly as possible. Can a person like me even get a job now ? I’m age 27 .


I was looking at 3 fields, but all involve a  lengthy studying time/skill acquisition time and less chance of getting a job – and time is something I don’t have : study finance to land a financial analyst job , study applied statistics to land a data analytics job – or somehow try to apply for business analyst job [by refreshing my domain knowledge from MBA]. I see a very very slim chance of me getting a job in these fields

Another thing I was thinking of was either take coaching for 10th standard Science/Maths or teach for MBA Entrance like CAT/GMAT etc. But how would I go about getting hired by a coaching center ?

Please help me.

We have an AMA scheduled with the filmmaker Suneel Raghavendra, whose film generated quite a bit of excitement when it was screened at the 8th Bangalore International Film Festival (BIFFES). One redditor had even recommended in [one of the threads here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4vcnu5/movie_recommendation_puta_tirugisi_nodi_what_a/).

'Although a trained Engineer, Suneel received a Diploma in Filmmaking (Writing and Direction) from the Prague Film School. After working in the direction department on Prakash Raj’s directorial debut NAANU NANNA KANASU, he became an Assistant Director on B Suresha’s National Award winning PUTTAKKANA HIGHWAY.  A few short films later, Suneel took the first step towards feature filmmaking with PUTA TIRUGISI NODU.'

His latest film is about Mohan – a young, cricketer turned teacher, who has to overcome a big challenge in his personal life, and teach a motley bunch of kids what it means to play hard but fair.

* *""But IIPM doesn’t define my existence. I don’t earn my bread and butter from IIPM. IIPM is my passion.""* He has several other firms.
* On Modi, *""He has fabulous leadership qualities. I hate religion per se but I supported Modi openly.""* The Sunday Indian, edited by him, carried a cover-story about Rahul Gandhi in 2006 when it was launched.

* *""Financially, I had to spend in high eight figures. Personally, it did affect me. I will not lie. There were days when I couldn't sleep, days when I didn't have an idea how we would sustain the company, days when my wife and I discussed the shape our life was taking. But every time I met a young person cheated by IIPM, I felt that this was a battle I had to fight.""*
* *""In the five years after we started the battle, 12,000-15,000 students enrolled in IIPM courses had to go through the pain. I may have won the battle but, during this, thousands of students lost out. That's not a nice feeling.""*

He's on Twitter at @NihalaniPahlaj, but since his account is not verified I will not be linking to it. He's also reachable at Gmail at lastname.firstname at gmail dot com. 

My five questions are this:

- What are you proudest of at your stint at the CBFC?  
- How much of a role did you have in the philosophy of regional censor board offices? What was your specific role there?  
- What do you think your successor needs to finish at CBFC that you started?  
- Were there any previous CBFC chairpersons you approached for advice and counsel?  
- How would you characterise your future film productions after this stint at the CBFC?

1536282540.0,10,46,17,"I spent a majority of my childhood outside India in the middle east. I returned to India roughly 20 years ago. I had fully settled in to India. I didn't quite miss anything from the middle east barring the food and stable electricity :P 

I had a choice to make about 10 years ago, to move out of India and I chose not to. Mostly because my friend circle, my gf, and most of my family was in India at the time. I found a job in a great company that kickstarted my career fairly well. 


Due in part to my own existential crisis, due in part to a change in outlook around 6 years ago(post MBA) and due in part to everything that has been happening in the country for the last few years, I gradually started finding living in the country to be unbearable. This is not an anti-BJP post by any means. I've never been political and I do not see myself ever being. I do have ideologies which at the very core is ""Live and let live""....or to be blunt....Unfortunately and I'm sure a lot of you agree, the Indian society simply isn't going to let you do that. Its not that I was living a loud/flamboyant life. Its that even the simple life I tried to live was being threatened in several ways. 

This group, r/india though often negative in tone has also helped open my eyes to a lot of things. This discourse is important, if for nothing else, as an outlet for folks who are frustrated. For folks to empathize and sympathize.

At this point, we begin a change in tone...........

I saw my friends, colleagues and classmates gradually all leave the country. Some of them left around 8-10 years ago. None of them show a genuine interest in returning. But this didn't really bother me. I still had a great friends circle and I've always been exceptionally great and keeping in touch with my friends and meeting them every chance I get. Nothing was changing my mind that I needed to move out. 

But one day, something just snapped. I spoke to a friend of mine over dinner. She was a classmate from college. She had been working with a firm in Australia. See the thing is, she and I never spoke in college but we just knew each other. I saw on fb that she was in town, we got chatting and decided to meet up. She was asking why I don't look for opportunities abroad. I said I never felt that things are necessarily that much better there. She said she could potentially find me a job. 

I found out that she and I were in similar industries. She was earning(post-conversion) around 60L more than me. I told her that really doesn't matter given living costs. She told me she 'saves' roughly 20 LPA. And believe me, she's not someone who tries to save. This was a time when I was commuting about 90 minutes one way to work. 8km. She travels 20 minutes to work and can afford to stay away from the central/expensive parts of the city due to great public transport. 

She lives a healthy and fun life. Has co-workers who know to stick to their boundaries. Has no one bother her about what she wears, who she's with, what she eats etc. I couldn't find a single objective measure, to counter her with. 

I made it my life's mission to find out for myself whether this was all truly the case. So I started looking out. Thankfully, my wife was offered a perfectly timed transfer to a western country for 2 years and that came with a Visa for me as well. And so I took the leap. Found myself a job before I landed here. 

Its been a few months now and I've finally seen what this other side is like today. This is an abrupt end to this post but that's because there's too much to write if I explained everything else.

So feel free now to ask me anything you want about my thoughts/experiences.

Our folks have finally met, and contrary to the usual drama one would expect, everything went well and our families are genuinely happy for us. We tie the knot by year end. 
 
Her father's English is fine, but her mother really doesn't speak the language (appreciate the effort though) - mostly unintelligible. Still, I translated where needed and filled in the blanks.

All the while waifu-to-be was a wee bit nervous with the whole interaction scene, but it turned out to be a lovely evening. They've traveled a long way and I was joking how the roles have reversed in contrast with traditional Indian norms where the prospect groom is expected to visit the bride and her family.
 
Mom had seen her photos on my Facebook, but was overly impressed with her skin and hair in person, to the point I had to ask her to tone it down a bit with the awkward complements. My dad and her dad got into conversations around food and a bunch of other stuff. 
 
I guess I'm writing this because it's a bit surreal how smooth everything has been. Her folks had zero issues with their daughter dating a gaijin, maybe because they knew where I worked, and my folks are just happy I didn't turn out to be gay (they had suspected so for a while on extremely silly grounds). Had it been an Indian partner, I don't think it would have been this straightforward.

Anyway, I'm tired and will crash, but feel free to ask me anything about Japan, work and life there, partners and dating etc.

Just want to make a note that we're very low-key, sober and laidback as a couple. She does not look like a dolled up AV model, I do not look like Tom Cruise's Indian cousin, and we're both quite career minded. So please don't ask questions like it's r/indiansgonewild.

>Rahul hails from Alwar, Rajasthan where he received his primary education.

Exambaba was made the official IIT-B archive before eventually being shut down. After a brief internship in Israel, Yadav returned to build apps for Google Chrome.

At the outset, I would like to tell you why I am doing this AMA. This young man /u/kumbhakaran (*I wonder why but he prefers not to be named*) who works with me and helps me with my legislative work requested me to do this. I agreed. 

After hearing about this AMA format of interaction, I thought it would be a good way to know what people think of the present situation in India. Your questions might be a link to finding solutions to issues that are uppermost in the minds of people of a certain creed. 

Being selfish, I would like to use these inputs sometime in Parliament. I am not sure how this could help improve the overall situation (or solve problems) but Reddit could prove to be an alternative communication channel for me. I am not on Twitter or Facebook. I like the anonymity that Reddit offers. Therefore I have dared to do this AMA here.

My policy team, /u/kumbhakaran and /u/ZainabHameed, will be helping me with this AMA. They will also participate and respond.

**BIG DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this AMA should definitely not be attributed to those of my party and leadership. I am answering these questions as a citizen of India. All views expressed here are personal. Same goes for my staff.**

So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india community. 

*I will start answering questions at 7 pm (IST).*

EDIT (20:01 IST): Thank you Redditors for participating in my AMA and a special thank you to the moderators. If some of you still have queries, please do post them. I will try to answer them sometime during this week. Don't be surprised if you find me as a regular Redditor after this. Amen!

EDIT (19:53 IST, March 20, 2015): I got some brilliant points from Redditors regarding the plight of the farming sector. Yesterday, I had allotted the time of the BJD to a colleague who unfortunately, did not use them. I spoke today (limited party time) and used some of the points in the House. /u/kumbhakaran has uploaded the video already!

Hey /r/India,

A little while back in an AMA request thread /u/lazyass_tiger suggested Chang. We reached out to Chang and he was awesome enough to agree! Here is the verification image: http://i.imgur.com/e4TebDE.jpg

Chang is one of the very few Indians who are of Chinese origin. Despite the disadvantage that people with Mongolian/North Eastern features have to face on a visual medium like TV/Movies, he has managed to overcome the stereotyping to a large extent and has done mainstream TV/Bollywood work. 

In case you haven't had a chance to see his work, here is a clip from Indian Idol, the show which made him a household name:

Your party has been ruling Orissa ever since Independence. But today it has worse [HDI than](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_and_territories_by_Human_Development_Index) even Bihar. 

Those wikipedia HDI numbers are from 2006. The [latest HDI list](http://i.imgur.com/JQTPQST.jpg) I can source is data from 2010, in this [UNDP report published in 2011](http://www.in.undp.org/content/dam/india/docs/inequality_adjusted_human_development_index_for_indias_state1.pdf). It shows that Orissa actually slipped behind Chattisgarh, to become the least developed state of India.

1525471683.0,10,79,552,"Last year, I had made a [post on this very subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/) asking your help to fight against injustice. I was a desperate person at that time and didn't think that there is any chance that it will be successful. After writing that post, I unknowingly became the mastermind behind a protest against corrupt college administrators, corrupt police officers and the media which would refuse to listen to us because they were getting money from these corrupt people.

This incident involves the torture and the death of a student caused by the college management, bribing the police and media to keep quiet, several months of protests which bloomed into a state-wide-unrest forcing the politicians to change sides, arrest & imprisonment of the absconding chairman of a college, vice principal, owners etc and finally the reform of the education system of an entire state! And, I was the one who orchestrated the protest which resulted in all of this. I spent every conscious hour of two months of my life working behind this campaign.

I dont want to repeat the entire incident, so you can read about the incident in detail in it's well written [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehru_College_of_Engineering_and_Research_Centre). Make sure to read about the student death controversy and then the police report which is below under different subsection. Also you can go through my old posts in this subreddit like [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/) and [this photo](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5niiw4/this_is_not_saudi_arabia_they_are_not_muslims/)

I am making this AskMeAnything so that my experience can help people who think ""I am just an ordinary person, I can't change the system, I can't protest against injustice."" or ""They are rich and corrupt, so there is no way to bring them to justice, so I should better move on with my life and do nothing"" or ""All the problems is due to the current system/government and I can't do anything about it"".

I was a no one in this incident. I didn't know the victim. I was not even a student of that college at that time. I was an ex-student. I had no ""benefit"" in doing any of this. Also, I did all of it anonymously. No one except about 5 friends know that I was working behind the scenes. 

Also, my major contribution was in directing the protest, contacting the right people, managing the information and running the campaign. I did majority of it by just sitting in a room with a laptop. There were hundreds of other brave people who staged the protest and did the things which I wanted to be done.

I didn't start out thinking I will coordinate this protest or spend so much time on it. This all started out when I started a Facebook page asking justice for the victim. I regularly posted new content and people started contacting me with new information or asking me what they should do. Within few days, I was having so much contact with so many people from various backgrounds like students, teachers, reporters, lawyers, ex-students, parents etc that I unknowingly became the one who was running the entire campaign both online and offline.

So many people selflessly helped in finding information. Some law students of other colleges volunteered to write legal notices or other such stuff. Some people traveled great distances to find certain information. Some people had contacts with politicians and was able to mobilize partymen. Some brought in media. Some were reporters who were directly taking content from me and posting it. Some were helping in the creation of the content. And, I had to ensure that the content I was providing is true.

After about a month of work, it started showing signs of success. We started to get the attention of mainstream media who started posting the full details without censoring anything. Then, few weeks later, this became the headline news of all the newspapers in the state. It became the talk of the town. I overheard so many people discussing about this incident while travelling in trains or buses.

Then, student protests broke out at many private colleges across the state demanding student unions and fighting against injustices. Few colleges even lost their affiliation and closed down due to this incident. And, students of one such engineering college was transferred to better colleges. My friends and relatives at several other colleges said that the situation has improved after this incident.

So, most of the politicians I meet are arrogant (to some extent) and usually don't talk much (Sushma Swaraj for example). I also met Anna Hazare a couple of years ago and not to mention, he was even more arrogant than politicians.

Anyways, this guy was super cool and friendly.When I approached him, he offered me a firm handshake. He even told me that I have an over-complicated phone unlock pattern (which was true :) ). I wanted to take a selfie but I don't think he likes em so he told his P.A. to take a picture of us. I also told him about reddit and asked him if he could do an AMA here. I told him that many famous people have done AMAs including celebrities and politicians, and damn he threw a bouncer. He asked me to name a few politicians and I couldn't remember name of even one Indian politician who has done an AMA here. So I said I can't recall name of any politician but I told him about the recent AMA of Roy's director and also about other famous AMAs. He said he'll think about it. 

Personally, I believe he's a nice guy and I've always been a fan of him. He's one of the few guys that are responsible for the survival of Congress. I believe we need more young politicians like him.

For the guys who don't know him, from wikipedia:

> Son of a senior politician Rajesh Pilot, he became the youngest Member of Parliament in the country at the age of 26. Pilot was a Member of the Lok Sabha's Standing Committee on Home Affairs and Member of the Consultative Committee in the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

>  In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, he defeated Bharatiya Janata Party's Kiran Maheshwari by a margin of 76,000 votes and won the seat of Ajmer.

>  In the 2014 Lok sabha elections, he was again nominated from the Ajmer constituency.Pilot, sitting MP from Ajmer, was defeated by a margin of 1,71,983 votes by Bharatiya Janata Party's sitting MLA Sanwarlal Jat.

Apart from the weed smoking and Pink Floyd referencing, I really enjoyed reading the questions and answers that you guys put forward. Thank you for that. And I must tell you that sir really enjoyed interacting with you.

Taking the conversation forward, I would like to hear your thoughts about how Reddit India can be used as a platform to get policy inputs for Parliament. 

To start with, I will try to get more [LAMP](http://lamp.prsindia.org/thefellowship) like me on board. Our parent organization, [PRS Legislative Research](http://www.prsindia.org/), can also be involved. I cannot give any guarantees here but I will try my best to convince 'influential people' to get on board. On a personal note, I will be putting up regular self-posts to get inputs from the Reddit Community for sir. He has approved of this and he said he will also try to participate in these discussions when time permits.

Do let me know what you think. I believe this could prove to be a game changer for public participation in policy.

EDIT: People please! Don't mean to be rude, but I didn't come here hunting for praise about my boss or me. I really want to hear your thoughts about how to formalize this initiative.
Once I get the inputs from this community, I can take the conversation forward with other people outside this forum. And I want make some headway before Parliament goes into recess.

Mods, please help me out here and give some ideas?

1) Can we have a special Policy section?

2) Flairs for people working in policy? 

I can't think of much because I haven't handled subreddits at all. Ideas please!

I'm learning and growing *every day* as much as (if not more than) you or anyone else in here and this learning is meant to be an infinite journey, be it for you or for me or for anyone else. Two: I will try to answer all questions, except for questions to which I quite frankly have *no answers to*. There are plenty of areas within the human experience that I have little to no experience with, and I'll *not* talk about things I don't know jackshit about because hypocrisy/fakery isn't my branch of expertise. Three: And this is the most important thing. Please do not take my words as gospel just because I'm ""woke"" - for what I have to offer is but a different perspective than what you may have considered before. Use your own discernment, logic, intuition and experimentation to see what works for you and what doesn't. Even if you think that I'm a complete fake, all I ask is that you at least read what I have to say with an open mind, take what works for you and trash what doesn't. Because as right or wrong as I could be, no two people have the same paths towards attaining spiritual awakening. So, even if what I have to offer in terms of an advice is appropriate for, say, 10 out of 100 people; there are still always going to be 90 others who will find no relevance in my words. That does not necessarily mean that I'm being a fraudulent cunt, it would just mean that 90 others have different ways of going about things, which is a *perfectly valid thing*.

**Why *Is* AMA?**  

Humanity as a whole is headed towards some pretty fucking challenging times ahead and some truly unpleasant and shattering revelations about the nature of the reality that they are living in. A lot of those challenging situations are already presenting themselves in every way even at personal levels, just look at all of the fear, negativity, sadness and depression in any of the Reddit threads; or anywhere else on the internet for that matter. The internet is just a smaller reflection of the greater reality and planetary consciousness. And then, there are all of these changes that are also now rapidly taking place across people's lives, and will shortly be taking place across national, global and even greater scales than that. All I wish to do here is to assist anyone going through troubled times (who is at least willing to listen to a fresh perspective) because it would honestly be such a waste if I knew all of these cool things and was ultimately unable to help anyone when they truly needed it. Not happening on my watch.  

Thank you for your time.  

**P.S.** Even after this AMA is over, I'll be there to assist any of you who are at all interested in the same through the direct messaging feature. Hope that helps.  

**EDIT 1:** Please keep asking questions even though seeing my replies may take some time; mainly because I tend to write really long-ass replies. I prefer to be really comprehensive about this, hope you'll understand.  

**EDIT 2:** For all those who are interested in knowing more about what happens after death and things such as how ""soul contracts"" that we make prior to incarnation upon this planet work, you are most welcome to visit the [""Exceptional Experiences"" section (link)](http://www.nderf.org/Archives/exceptional.html) of the NDERF (Near Death Experience Research Foundation) experience contribution repository.

**EDIT 3:** For anyone interested in finding out whether they too have Technokinesis abilities like me that I've **[spoken about here \(in point #2\)](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8o1tqa/ama_i_am_a_spiritually_awakened_person_from_pune/e00h8f7/)**, you are more than welcome to visit the **[Fourmilab Retropsychokinesis Experiments page](https://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/experiments/)** and try out the goodies in there for yourselves. I'm pretty sure anyone can do it if they simply focused. Hope this helps.  

**EDIT 4:** To all of the people who only have to mock what I have to say in here and are busy contributing nothing positive to the discussion, I would love to ask, what pleasure does doing so give you? Look through my posts and you'll realise that not only have I been up all night (and right back now that it's morning!) to make sure that every question I've been asked gets answered, but also I've made sure to answer nearly every question (including some of the openly ill-intentioned ones) to their fullest detail wherever I can, even though it has taken me *hours* to do so. And (so far as I can see) I haven't tried to sell or market a single thing to anyone, or as much as mentioned my name. **There have been ""stickied AMAs"" in here that have answered 1% of your (hundreds of) questions in 1 line at best, that too, only to promote some products or agendas or for profits (PC AMA, anyone?).** At least I'm not doing that. At least I'm being sincere about what I have to offer even though my post has gotten such little visibility (due to not being stickied). I'm not asking for your respect here, all I'm asking is that you not deter others who are genuinely interested in asking/answering questions and the pursuit of truth by being so *mean* to them. Is that really too much to ask for? I leave it to you to answer.",,[AMA] I am a spiritually awakened person from Pune here to offer assistance to troubled souls in these challenging times.

Greetings [/r/India](https://www.reddit.com/r/India)!

Tomorrow, August 24, marks the first anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision on the Right to Privacy judgement. This marked an important point for the conversation around what it means to be free. To love, to share and to learn. Privacy makes a lot of this possible. An essential part of a privacy right is to ensure India gets a law that protects people from the harmful use of digital technologies that profile and surveil them. One of the efforts to make sure this legal reform takes place is the SaveOurPrivacy campaign which has proposed a model law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 that is open for feedback and comment. Some of the lawyers and policy experts will join the Reddit community today between 6:30 - 7:30 IST to chat on not only this campaign but reflect in the broader privacy issues including the social media communication hub, mass CCTV deployment, Cambridge Analytica.

If you have privacy badger installed on your browser, show up. If you use duckduckgo, show up. If you didn't link your Aadhaar to anything, show up. If you worry about strong encryption preventing law enforcement agencies from doing their work, show up!

Collectively, we are the #SaveOurPrivacy drafting volunteers. Our twitter handles are below.
