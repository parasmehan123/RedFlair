I have seen many companies do it. They put out vacant positions on their websites but eventually they just onboard a hiring consultancy that will provide them often technically sub-standard resources at dirt cheap price. They hardly even evaluate the candidate to check her/his capability.

Most resources hired via consultancies are often not very strong technically and have a hard time performing in a business setting.  They are also a burden to the existing full time employees because most of their time is spent on providing knowledge transfer (KT) to these new joiners who don't even take ownership of the projects. They don't even care. Heck, most are not even accountable. Some of them just stay for a short stint, enjoy the perks and abandon the projects mid way blaming work life balance and lack of KT. And then the entire process of hiring and KT keeps repeating for ever.

What is the logic behind this? Why do companies do this? Do the HR departments of companies have some sort of shady deal with these consultancies? Is the HR department so overworked that they have to deal with consultancies for hiring? Or are these vacant positions on the job boards just a formality that the companies have to do to show themselves as an active hirer?",,ak9em5,,0,,false,1552717120,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/ak9em5/why_do_companies_put_out_vacancies_on_their/,,,false,Non-Political,

(example of good governance and ethics),"TL;DR: lost my wallet in bus and was found at lost and found section at bus station. Happy as well as impressed by the system that actually functions well.



Last Friday I had boarded a city bus and used my bus card to pay for the ride. I somehow would have dropped my wallet in bus. 

I thought, I have lost it as it had money, ID card, bus card etc.

Today we went to the main bus station to get a new bus card reissued.

As I gave my name at the counter, the employee went back to her cabin and brought back my purse with everything intact.

She mentioned that we maintain a lost and found register and if people / bus drivers / cleaning staff find wallets, personal belongings or anything which carries some sort of identification they forward it here and people can collect it back.

Two things I liked from this experience.

1. A system in place that functions well. We also have lost and found section in India; however, there isn't a proper system for tracing and tracking.

2. Employees / people took effort to bring back someone's belongings to the lost and found department. It shows how they weren't greedy and were really hoping that the belongings go back to their rightful owner.

I have my wallet returned to me in India as well and I had also found phones and have returned to rightful owners.

So, I believe that good karma helped me. 

Anyways, just felt like sharing here about good experience.

I agree. Privacy concerns, lack of proper service and all the other reasons listed are all reasons to not use a particular service. However, you know what? Jio will still be wildly successful. And it all comes down to the mentality of the majority of people. 

If it is cheap and it works for you, nothing else matters. Use it, abuse it, do whatever you want, as you will not directly be affected. 

The same applies to public services like transport. Use, abuse, the same cycle. Any fare increments to fund expansion / proper maintenance are opposed, and finally when the companies try to make some money by pawning off station names to mobile phone brands, the same crowd that refused to pay for the service will complain about it. 

Toilets, lets not get started. Government builds toilets, people use them as storage, shops, etc, and continue to enjoy the crisp early morning air on their arses. There are places in Mumbai, the financial capital of India, that literally smell of shit.

Press the button in the direction you are going: “up” if you’re going up, and “down” if you’re going down.

Wait until the direction lights point to the same direction you are going to  and only then enter the elevator.

Once inside, press the floor you are going to and the lift will take you there.

That’s it. Simple? No need to press all the buttons, it just makes the elevator work more, and become slower. Imagine that there is one person on each floor doing exactly that: this would mean many unnecessary stops and many unnecessary rides. And nobody wants that.

So to sum up: if you’re going up then PRESS THE UP BUTTON, regardless of where the lift is; if you’re going down – PRESS THE DOWN BUTTON. If the direction of the lift is down and you want to go up, DON’T enter. It will not go up, even if you “command” it to.

I just relocated within Hyderabad, and being a TATA Sky customer for almost 10 years, I was given free moving service for the connection. Who complaints about that, right? Here's when the drama starts. The guy who came for reinstallation says that second wire that goes into the STB for recording can be replaced a using a splitter. He installed it and charged us around 400 in cash, even though the customer service rep specifically said it will be deducted from the account directly. I didn't put much thought into it because I was busy moving my stuff and all. 

Four days later, I start getting ""signal not found"" on HD channels intermittently. I call them up again and they sent another serviceman over. He says that the receiver (black component facing the dish) has an issue and replaced it with a new one. After the installation, while walking back to the TV, he gave me an option to buy directly from him for a cheaper price. I didn't want any under the table dealings, and flat out declined and asked to be charged directly from the account. He said OK and then got the code from STB to close that ticket and said I'd get another code tomorrow and I need to give him over the phone. I said no one would be home and do what he needs to do right now. He was persistent on it and so I called customer care right away to see what was going on and hand over the phone him. He changes his story saying the STB auto fixed the issue and hung up. He called his head (I suppose) and I can hear him yelling at this guy for letting me call the customer care. He then leaves saying company is not at loss, nor am I. He has to bear the loss. 

I called up customer service again after he left, to confirm what issue he ""fixed"" and how. They said the resolution was noted saying it issue autocorrected itself. I asked if there was a mention of any new equipment installed, and they said no. I asked if the new equipment information could be added later, and they said it's unlikely because the ticket has already been closed.

I already raised a complaint about all the crap happening. Clearly no equipment was needed and all this was them conning customers. Imagine an elderly or uneducated person in this situation. I'm sure they're easy targets for these a**holes.

 If TATA Sky rep comes in for a service:
1. All charges go on the account and not on cash
2. No service code the next day
3. If they insist on cash or getting the code next day, call customer service and explain them the situation.

someday or the other people will come to realise the damage they've inflicted on their bodies when their lungs start to give in to respiratory diseases .

I realise that natural causes such as the low temperature dispersion of particles etc etc have a lot to do with the rise in AQI , but implementation of certain measures from our side will surely help in reducing it from an extremely hazardous level of 999 to say 400-500

The bad news first, this post is in reference to the IT sector, in particular, product based companies. The good news? If you can think logically even one bit, you can easily transition into this sector. Does not matter if you don't have a formal degree in computers. 

Here are some pointers:

1. IT does not directly equate to computer science. You can very well write software without knowing how a compiler works or what is the difference b/w ARM and x86.
2. But a good engineer will always know about these subjects, at least the basics. You can always learn these things after you get the job. Knowing how stuff works will always make you stand out of in your team. 
3. Companies don't give a toss about how many languages you know. I gag every time a punter here on this sub writes, ""...I know Java, C++, C# and Haskell..."". It impresses no one and you make an ass out of yourself every time you say this in an interview. And trust me, knowing a language's syntax does not mean shit. You think you know Java? Oh, then please explain to me why you shouldn't ever start a thread inside a constructor. And also explain to me how 'volatile' works. To answer this question, you need to know the JVM (such questions won't generally be asked for entry-level positions).
4. If you say that you can write Android applications, then it better be on the Play Store. If you say that you are a 'full-stack' engineer, then please show me your website. Otherwise remove these skills of your from the resume please. To be honest, companies don't give a shit about your resume for an entry-level position.
5. Oh, so you used Couchbase as the data store for your website? Why not Cassandra? Why did you even go for a NoSQL? How would you change your design to handle a 50,000 TPS? You should be ready to answer such questions. But again, these are SDE-3 level questions and won't be asked to a fresher. I am just trying to emphasise upon the fact that you need to really know your stuff if you claim that you know it. You used Couchbase just because it sounded hip isn't going to impress anyone.
6. Stay at bay from buzzwords du jour. 
7. Product based companies look for engineers who can understand and solve problems. I think a 6 month internship at Amazon in 2017 (didn't get an offer). My manager always used to say, ""You haven't been hired to write code, you have been hired to solve problems"". This statement could not be any closer to the truth.
8. Getting into these companies requires a lot less effort than cracking that bank exam (or whatever) you are prepping for. And it is a lot more rewarding. Better career prospects, challenging and stimulating problems to solve, and a much better pay.
9. A ground footing in DSA will shield you from all your shortcomings - no projects, poor communication skills, bad breath. On the other hand, no project or skill in the world will make up for your lack of knowledge of DSA. YOU WILL GET REJECTED.
10. Service based companies on the other hand, do not want you to think. They want you to work like robots, doing mechanical work. That's why they pay you 3.5lpa - the supply is much, much greater than the demand. 

Too tired, shall continue tomorrow maybe.

Parents would want you to do arranged marriage with ""a girl (or boy) of their choice""  but there are many challenges for both genders in finding an appropriate match.

&amp;#x200B;

parents will say with confidence that they'll find a girl/boy for you. Let me tell you, they get frustrated after one year and then ask you ""if you have anyone then let us know"" but then it is too late. Please don't repeat the mistake done by scores of people (don't ask the obvious question here, take the advice :P).

&amp;#x200B;

Parents will backtrack from their statement and even if you do arranged marriage and it doesn't work out, they will not take responsibility for it. So marry your bf/gf. Parents will accept your marriage within one year and you'll be married to someone you already know.

Naturally, gyms can sustain their business just based off upfront fees from new joinees. And the number of quitters is equally large. End result is that the gyms have no reason to provide existing customers any service. Going one step beyond, if existing customers quit midway, it's much more profitable for them as there is more room for new joinees. The only exception to this rule is if you pay for 'personal trainers', costing anywhere between 3.5k pm and 20k pm. That's recurring income to the gym and they make every effort to keep that alive.

My interaction with the owner was very candid and I spoke about some earlier bitter gym experiences where the trainers were not helpful because I didn't pay for personal training (Mistake #1) and he told me how the spot offers are common in fitness industry and how he gave me a further discount because I was carrying a competitor's bag. I was impressed and was very excited as it's a decent gym and took the offer (Mistake #2).

Day 2: My body assessment was supposed to be done as part of the package (every 45 days). The owner was dealing with another customer, I waited patiently to discuss it but when my turn came, he asked me to go inside and talk to a trainer, in a frustrated tone. No pleasantries at all. I was so surprised that I started doubting whether it's the same guy I spoke to on Day 1. I spent around 20 minutes on treadmill trying to recollect every detail of the previous day's conversation and grew confident it's the same guy. Anyway, I finished my routine and asked a nearby trainer for body assessment. He looked at me as though I asked him for his 'kavach kundal'. I told him I finished training for the day and whether it would be a problem. He was visibly relieved and told me it should be done pre-workout. My thoughts: ""Yeah, right. Of course. Owner should have told me at the door itself, whatever, but this guy looks so happy that he doesn't have to take my measurements. Am I so ugly/smelly?""

Day 3: I went in a shirt and shorts. It's almost a T-Shirt but has buttons. (Mistake #3) Went straight to previous day's trainer who rejected me and asked him to complete body assessment. I just a wanted a quick win. He again was disappointed by my choice, but a light bulb went off in his head and asked me in a confrontational tone ""Why are you wearing a shirt?"". I was pissed and asked him ""What am I supposed to be wearing? Is shirt not allowed? Can you tell give me a list of clothes that are not allowed?"" He took me to the owner. The conversation went like this: He: ""Shirts are not allowed."" Me: ""Oh okay. What else is not allowed? Please give me the list."" He: ""There is no list, but shirts are not allowed. I can't let you in"" Me: ""Okay, sure. I will come in Tees from tomorrow"" He: ""I can't let you in"" Me: ""Okay, tell me what all things are not allowed. Are pink socks allowed? Are vulgar T-Shirts, say with a 'fuck you' written on it allowed? I can't back and forth"" He: ""They are all allowed"" Me: ""Give me a list"" He: ""You give me a list of questions, I will answer"" Me: ""It will be long"" He: ""I will answer all questions, give me the list"" Me: ""It's going to be 200 pages long"" He: ""Really, I will fill that for you if you give the list""

&amp;#x200B;

I was extremely frustrated by the conversation, went home, fired up my laptop, looked up a list of clothes, a list of colors. Took a cross product and got a 5000 page list. Printed 5 pages of it. Went back in a T-Shirt and handed him the list. Got body assessment by the same asshole. The adrenaline was enough for 30 minute treadmill where I tried to analyze their behavior, my behavior and concluded that shitty customer service is part of the fitness industry. This is a unique problem as demand is driven by an outside trend followed by an extremely high buyer's remorse and resulting dropouts but the demand is high enough to sustain the business and remorse is high enough that it's very difficult to retain existing customers. It's like the parathe wala gali in Chandni Chowk.

&amp;#x200B;

Day 4: Me: ""Were you able to answer my queries?"" Owner: ""I don't have the time"" Me: ""Do you think I have the time to go back and change everytime or patience to deal with rude customer customer service?"" Him: ""We were not rude"" Me: ""Do you think 'Why are you wearing a shirt?' is the best way to tell me shirts are not allowed""? Him: ""Oh, you have asked me whether pink socks are okay."" Me: ""But it's your staff who was rude first"" Him: ""I apologize"" Me: ""I want your staff to apologize, until then I will be carrying your rival gym's bag and giving them free publicity while bad mouthing yours"" Him:""You can do whatever you want"" Me: ""Damn right I can""

&amp;#x200B;

Day 5-7: We don't see eye-eye, neither owner nor trainer. But make it point to utilize the equipment to the fullest as I have a very long subscription.

&amp;#x200B;

Larger question is, is there a way to fix this system? I gave one star on maps.google.com and found many other people complaining about similar behavior.  I should have checked the reviews. I checked all gyms in my locality. All of them have a lot of one star ratings complaining about bad behavior. That's how I tested my hypothesis. The whole industry is a hell-hole.

I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7oor1a/shout_out_to_tamil_cinema_for_2017_they_made_some/) last year for the 2017 films, so i figured i might as well continue with it this year. I also missed some films from last year that i ended up watching this year and thought were great, they were[ Kaatru Veliyidai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaatru_Veliyidai), [Lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_\(film\)),[ Oru Kidayin Karunai Manu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oru_Kidayin_Karunai_Manu) and [Meyaadha Maan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyaadha_Maan). Since 2017 was such a great year for Tamil Cinema it was going to be hard for 2018 to beat it, and of course it didn't. The film strike where there were no new releases for like a hundred days certainly didn't help. But overall it still ended up being a good year. Here are some of the films you should check out:

*****

- [**Savarakathi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savarakathi): 

*Synopsis: A barber has a fight with a gangster on the road, and the encounter forces him to run all over the city to save himself.*

Savarakathi works as a hilarious black comedy, written by Mysskin who's known for his serious drama's this was quite a surprise. 

*****

- [**Kaala**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaala_\(2018_film\))

*Synopsis: A resident of Dharavi unites the people living in his area to stand up against a ruthless politician who dreams of taking over their land.*

Pa Ranjith's and Rajith's second outing after Kabali (was alright) works much better than the first. After the slightly long first act things shift into gear with the introduction of Nane Patekar and  Ranjith running free with his ideologies. Rajini is charismatic as ever and, i'm surprised the movie had the balls to [spoiler](#s ""kill him off at the end"")

*****

- [**Kolamavu Kokila**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolamavu_Kokila)

*Synopsis:  A young woman takes up drug peddling to make money for the treatment of her mom, who has cancer.*

Nayanthara has been really good at choosing different scripts and challenging herself lately and this Black Comedy works well with many laugh out loud moment's but also well written. 

*****
- [**Pariyerum Perumal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pariyerum_Perumal)

*Synopsis: Although an idealistic youth is optimistic about his future as he enters college, a tragic chain of events will wake him up to the harsher realities of life.*

Releasing alongside Mani Ratnam's Chekka Chivantha Vaanam which turned out to be a smash hit(and was rather disappointing), this film got overlooked a lot. Mari Selvaraj tackles caste issues in modern society in a brilliantly written film, with a wonderful performance from Kathir he embodies Pariyerum Perumal perfectly showcasing his anger and pain perfectly. 

*****

- [**Vada Chennai**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vada_Chennai)

*Synopsis: A young carrom player in north Chennai becomes a reluctant participant in a war between two warring gangsters.*

I always get giddy whenever i see a collaboration between Vetrimaaran and Dhanush, they always manage to hit it out of the park and they manage to do it again in Vada Chennai. Although not the most original film he's made (you'll see a shades of pulp fiction and various other gangster films in this) it still manages to grip us all the way through with the way he executes the film. Ameer Sultan as Rajan was the standout performance of the film. Btw Vetrimaaran and Dhanush have already announced their next collaboration in Asuran, thought this would get it's sequel since it was the first of a trilogy but oh well we can wait. 

*****

- [**Mercury**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(film)

*Synopsis: Maimed from mercury poisoning, five longtime friends come together for a high school reunion, and it turns into nonstop terror.*

Karthik Subbaraj after his complicated drama's of Jigarthanda and Iraiva goes a bit back to his root's of his first film Pizza with a Thriller. After Kamal Hassan's Pushpak Vimana in 1987, Mercury is the only silent film India has made till then. Although the plot might be a bit simple, the carefully constructed score along with gorgeous cinematography keep you hooked till the end.  

*****

- [**Ratsasan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratsasan)

*Synopsis: : A serial killer is murdering school girls, and a newbie cop has to track him down before the victim count increases.*

Director Ram Kumar creates a engaging thriller with many scenes that keep us on the edge of our seats throughout the film. Though the film loses steam toward the end the initial portions have some fantastic editing with a soundtrack that raises it's level even further. 

*****

- [**96**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/96_(film)

*Synopsis: A chance visit to his school leads to a photographer connecting with his school friends, and they decide to have a reunion.*

Debut director Prem Kumar creates a nostalgia ride with great performances from Trisha and Vijay Sethupathi. Aside from the tad stretched second half 96 works well, rather than manipulating the audience with cheap melodrama the movie keeps itself grounded and realistic and works wonderfully. The film also has a great soundtrack from Govinda Vasantha, which was soulful. 

*****

- [**Merku Thodarchi Malai**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merku_Thodarchi_Malai)

*Synopsis:  Merku Thodarchi Malai revolves around the life and times of a group of people living along the foothills of the Western Ghats.*

I'm not sure there's much to say, the synopsis explains the movie perfectly, it's definitely one of the best films of the year. 

*****

And that's it, there were probably other films that didn't make the list either because i didn't like them or haven't watched them, feel free to suggest them in the comments. I haven't checked out [Seethakaathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seethakaathi) or [Kanaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanaa_\(film\)) yet, but they've been getting good reviews. 

On a side note, here are some of the more mainstream Tamil films that you should keep track of:

- [Petta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCB0ZfQ9Rzs): I'd never imagine Karthik Subbaraj making an full out commercial entertainer with Rajini given his filmography but i'm hyped for it. Rajini looks better than ever in the promos and Karthick has never disappointed. 

- [Enai Noki Paayum Thota](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6jXCfE_hQQ) and [Dhruva Natchithiram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekvi8tVYem0): It's been 2 years since the last GVM flick (which was rather underwhelming) and these keep getting on delayed, hopefully they find their release date within 2019 and show a return to form for him.

- [NGK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGK_\(film\)): Another film i'm massively hyped for, after a long hiatus (since 2013) Selvaraghavan is back with his next movie in a collaboration with Suriya. 

- [Naragasooran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQkQlRYqvtg): Another film that's been kept delayed. After the surprisingly great debut with Dhuruvangal 16, all eyes are on Karthick Naren to give us another great film with his next one.

- [Peranbu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Nk7bEYIA7c): Director Ram is a also another proven filmmaker with Thanga Meenkal and Taramani, this one's been making it's way across award ceremonies and should get it's release soon. 

- There's also probably a lot of other small releases we probably won't hear about till they get released so keep your eyes out for them.

This is probably a long shot. I'm in my final year of my master's in economics. I'm doing my MA Economics from a generic college in India located in a tier 4 town.

I've not done math at my 10+2 level. This makes me ineligible for many courses in economics. However , somehow even if I'm eligible I'd not persist the competition because I lack the adequate skill set to compete with other kids. 

All my friends from school , even though they have not achieved anything stellar with their life , I feel that they have done more. Also , as an addenum , they get more opportunities than I , just by the virtue of studying in a cosmopolitan city. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so betrayed. It was because of my family , I was forced into studying here. When confronted with the reason ; why ? My mom says , studying somewhere there , you'd probably have smoked weed and got laid and chances of your salvation and eternal life have been risked. (My mom is a fervent and devout christian). That is probably true , I might have done all those things , if I studied in a city. 

However , at the moment I'm about to graduate , I feel so betrayed by my family. They said that , family does things always in your best interest. No, never. I still remember my mom saying , that , you studying here and not doing any sin , you'll find better employment than all your peers and all your friends when you are about to graduate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm about to graduate and I've neither found any employment nor am I in a good position.Whereas , my friends many of them are working in startups and MNC's , even though not top tier management , they're getting paid. Heading out on weekends , having fun. While , I'm wiling away my 20's.

Neither , am I the smartest one , I consistently score 7.5-8.5 CGPA. Right , now all my dreams and hopes have evaporated into the air.Maybe , if I studied there with my friends smoked weed and stuff ,I may still have been a daft kid , but at least I might have had a few good memories. 

All hope has deserted me...

People calling as Amazon.in Gifts &amp; Promotions Dept,"Got a call from someone pretending to be from Amazon's Gift's &amp; Promotions department (Phone# 7602972359). Knew it was a scam but I played along until the point when I would have to send them money. Goes like this ..

&amp;#x200B;

1. You have been selected as a winner for a prize.
2. You can choose between 5 prizes. Laptop, TV, thing3, thing4, thing5.
3. I selected TV, they ask you to check out their offered TV by model# on [Amazon.in](https://Amazon.in) (It was some Sony Bravia).
4. To get the gift you have to buy something from Amazon worth at-least ₹5K. I said I'd get a Fire Stick 4K for ₹5,999
5. They then say talk a whole lot of bull about how Amazon to make it seem like they are the real deal 
6. They keep repeating that the gift (TV) and your selected &gt;₹5K purchase will show up in your Amazon cart
7. Catch is that you have to pay them for the ₹5K purchase via NEFT or Google-Pay and some other wallets
8. I said I would pay via NEFT and they asked which Bank, I said HDFC and they put me on hold then said HDFC is not supported. I played along and said I would pay via Google Pay
9. They had me launch my app and enter the following info: Account Name: AMAZON. Acc# 919617658394. IFSC PYTM0123456.
10. Then on the next screen they asked me to enter the amount for the purchase (₹5,999 for the Fire Stick 4K).
11. At this point I was just teasing the chap and questioning his life choices and why he did this for a living.
12. Poor guy was probably convinced by the main people running the scam that this was legit.
13. Anyway, I told him that I am not paying anything until I can confirm this is really an Amazon account.
14. His logic was that since I entered the Account Name as AMAZON, it has to be real, since no one can open a bank account with a fake company name. I told him I can enter DONKEYIDIOT in that Name field as well and Google Pay app will have no issues.
15. Anyway, I got bored and bid my goodbye. He was disappointed.

Just wanted people here to to aware of the scam and ask where I can report the Acc# and the Phone#

I have been using this tracker for the past 7 months and it has proved extremely helpful in shedding 7 kgs. I thought someone else out there would also be struggling and, like me, can benefit from this tracker. 

Obviously, this is v1.0 so its not the most refined product :-) and I would love any feedback to improve it.

This incident highlights how justice is delivered to common man in India. 

Why are our courts so slow ? 

Why there are no time bound judgments ?

If courts don't have enough judges - why is our tax money not spent to recruit required number of judges ?

I, like some of you has been losing hair since 19 and my hair days are now over. I understand the stress that comes with it. I had gone into depression because of it and the suffering is real. But as harsh as it sounds, there is no cure of genetic hairloss. I have done years and years of research on this and have even kept abreast of everything new ""cure"" that's coming up.

This post is NOT about people have seasonal hair loss or see a random patch every now. If your hair is constantly getting worse and you are sure it is genetic male pattern baldness, read on.

Here is what ACTUALLY works:

1. **Finasteride** (this is a hormonal drug and you have to take it for as long as you want to keep hair. Side effects which includes sexual dysfunction are supposed to be rare, so feel free to try and see if you get side effects. If you feel perfectly fine then you may a candidate for this)
2. **Minoxidil** (this can only *slow* down hair loss. At best it might give you an extra year. It's usually to be used with Finasteride, but like I said, alone, it *can* give you a little extra time).
3. **Hair transplant PLUS FINASTERIDE** (I put Finasteride in capitals because people forget that taking Finasteride is an important part of hair transplant treatment. Hair transplant involves *moving* hair from one place to another and it does NOT create new hair. Finasteride is very important in keeping what you already have. I know many young people who got amazing results from hair transplant, but over 5 years, their balding progressed and their hair started looking very sparse. Think a lot before you get a hair transplant in your 20s.)
4. **Hair system** (these are traditionally known as wigs, but now they have advanced significantly. You have to deal with the hassle of glueing it regularly on your head and there is the constant worry of it being not really a part of your body. But it might be worth trying if you are desperate)

Everything else - Saw Palmetto, whatever oils, Vitamin supplements, etc. don't cure genetic hairloss.

Think about this: There are some very very poor people who have 0 access to grooming and good nutrition and yet have thick afro hair. And then there are people like Jeff Bezos and Anil Ambani. If you are blessed with genetic hairloss, nothing can cure it. You can either slow it by a year or two or take Finasteride and keep your hair for longer.

**Scam doctors**

If you are going to visit a doctor, do NOT go to ""branded"" clinics like Richfeel, Dr. Batras, etc. These companies cheat you by using your insecurities. They will always claim that they are slowing down your hair loss but there is no measure of it. You are desperate, so you will pay them regardless because you are scared it will get worse which it will anyway. Open Google reviews of these companies and check how fake they are. They pay people to post fake reviews. How cheap is that?

If you want treatment, go to a reputed dermatologist near you.


**Final words**

That said, shaving your head or buzzing it or combing it over is always an option. Looks do matter, unlike what some people say. After I started shaving my head, lots of people have told me to grow it longer because according to them I look worse bald. Women don't prefer marrying bald dudes. That's what it is. You have to deal with the cards you're dealt with.

I am tired of seeing my own friends succumbing to cheap marketing and blatant lies told by many doctors. I hope no one else feeds such a cheap industry sucking out of people's insecurities.

I am sorry for the rant but I have no one else around to share it with and I need my self-confidence back.

Like most Indian families, most of my relatives' children are doctors. If not, then they are engineers or chartered accountants. And every time my relatives come over they keep babbling about their children and how brilliant they are. I am sick of the same, repeating conversations where people show fake sympathy for me. The worst part is that my own parents (whom I consider to be very supportive) keep asking about what their son/daughter is doing and how challenging medicine is and so on. I'm not throwing hate at either of the professions but I am sick and tired of the apathy and fake sympathy which Indians show towards students in the pure sciences/arts or any other course. As if they are feeling sorry for me for missing out on the only train leading to success. I just want to say this to anyone who needs it - be confident and unapologetic about your life choices. In fact, work your ass off, carve your own path, and show them in the fucking face what you are. You're not alone in this. Life doesn't end after you get your exam results. There's no magic carpet to lead a successful life and be financially well-off.

A close relative of mine lost his life in an accident. He was under the influence of alcohol yet he decided to rode all the way to nearby town to buy another bottle of alcohol only to collide head on with another biker doing speed north of 80+ km/h. The impact was so bad, one of his eye ball popped up, brain splattered all over the place and died on the spot. If only he wore a proper helmet or if he had some common sense which prevented him from driving under the influence of alcohol, he would have been here. 

He left his family alone. A caring wife, teen girl and a school going kid will suffer for no fault of theirs. My relative is not a middle class guy and have no property left. He and his wife had to work to have decent life and his earning is significant for them. As a person who lost his loved one just month ago, I know how hard it is going to be for the kids and for the wife. Not only the monetary burden but loss of loved one is just unbearable. I don't know how she is going to manage the rest of the life with just meagre earnings. I wish I can help her and god knows I do, but that wouldn't cut it. A loss is a loss, there is no two way about it.

It is really disheartening to see people throw away their lives like this. If only traffic education is present here, if only people have some responsibility. Lately I see a lot of vehicles, be it bike/car/auto etc, just drive without caring about the oncoming vehicle and turn the vehicle on their own time even when there is no room for that. Every week I see at least one accident in exact same location on my way to office and the pattern is almost same. Throttle the vehicle in tight corner only to end up in opposite lane causing accident. How hard it is for people to understand that the road is not a race track and there is no rush to reach their destination. Road is not a playground where a bigger vehicle bully smaller vehicle and cause injury. Vehicle is not a place where you drink or pee and have fun. No wonder life is so cheap in India when people them self don't value it much.

**Dear Redditor,**
All I'm asking is to value your life. Even if you feel your life is shitty, this is not the way to face things. By driving without helmet/wearing set belt you are depending on the other vehicles for your life. Please use proper gears be it whatever vehicle. Practice safe &amp; defensive driving. While driving think about fellow rider and say this to you, ""His life is as much valuable as yours"". 

**Please, don't throw away your life and let your loved ones suffer! Trust me, losing the most loved one can change the life altogether.

If you know someone who is trying to get into IITs should read them. I am in the final year of my B. Tech. of the college. Since the inception of the program we have changed three campuses. In first two years we were forced to live with 4 people in a room of size 20x10 sq. ft. room which were pest infested and poorly ventilated. The food wasn't good. In third year we were shifted to another campus which they rented from another college and were shifted to this campus which was completed in a hurry and didn't even had a water supply. In final year we were shifted in currently under-construction campus amidst dust and sound. Workers are still working here and there were reports of theft by the workers. There is a shortage of faculty here. Most of the faculty is new here so they just copy content from NPTEL. The main part I am going to tell is about the placements here. The placement here for core branches are pathetic. Just 60% people have been placed here in the core mechanical branch. The placement office is one of the worst managed. The HOD of placement is busy in other shenanigans and corrupt. The person working under him has been made in-charge of calling companies doesn't know how to talk and convinces companies by saying lies about calling them on first day, many companies have denied due to this. Even a student who was told that he was placed in company (He even gave party for this) was told later on that company has not chosen him instead another guy and he missed many companies as he was not allowed to sit . Due to above records and not to show their incompetency to bring companies to college they threaten the students to de-register from the T&amp;P so they could show bloated average and placement stats. There have been only good placements in the Computer science branch here and only 4 core companies came here to pick only 1-2 students each . Many companies just did Skype interview and didn't even hire people. I would suggest students who are currently studying to get here that if you are studying thinking that you will get good package here only only take admission here if you are getting CS . Else many other private colleges are better than here. (I am frustrated and didn't revise it please pardon me for errors)

I've copied my own comment and made a separate post to raise awareness. This is not just an issue of brain drain it's also about your healthcare. 


Doctors are being man handled when the patient dies. Illiterate fucktards start hitting them. I've personally witnessed 2 such incidents. In one incident the guy (deceased patients son ) came with his friends hit the doctor, held him  (pulled him from 6th floor by holding his collars , going downstaris i saw him on 2nd floor) and took him to police station  where they let our doctor go and put the guy in jail , justice was served late, he had bruises and a black eye, even security guards didn't protect the doctor as they were scared of locals, he came for next 1 month, treated every patient as usual and left our hospital. 

A MLA directly hit a pediatrician in my city  because of a death of 6 year old girl due to dengue. He (doctor) did lodge a complaint which was withdrawn later for some reason. People directly assume that death of young implies negligence of doctors. They don't consider the how late they arrived to the hospital. So basically uneducated , demented fucktards get to decide how the treatment went and whose fault it was without studying medicine for a second of their lives.


In rural areas, doctors won't mind working if they weren't afraid of safety and people are trying to frame them into things for monetary benefit.  

People take justice in their own hands and act based on emotional decisions. Very few people think rationally. That being said I won't let these harsh people stop me from practicing medicine, good patients outnumber evil ones but when a doctor is getting hit right infront of them they won't and they can't protect us. 

I treat everyone equally and follow protocols  but if I prioritize to attend a farmer who might die in next hour over a MLA with a headache , my ass might get in trouble. 

There are doctors who've committed crimes I agree but let the law and justice take care of them. Which again can be rigged. That was my experience of MBBS. 

Nowadays a lot of physicians (PGs mostly)are committing suicides due to constant stress and stuff like 36hr or 48hr duty following which they hardly get 6 to 12 hours off. We hardly get time for personal care while trying to pursue higher studies. There's a lot of things which people won't understand about us. In my final year I've gone days without sleeping to prepare for my exams. And if I get hit after going through such shit, I'd rather fucking die (our oath doesn't allow us to kill others with our medical knowledge). 


PS:

That being said please do not hesitate to go to psychiatrist if you're feeling down all the time, hopeless or worthless. People might say 'saala tu pagal hai Kya ?' If you tell them you're consulting a therapist. Fuck them! It's because of such mentality people are committing suicides.

* �� Giveaway [Part 4]

After launching three successful book giveaways — first [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9z3lxo/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_1984_by/), second [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a22a3v/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_animal_farm/), and third [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a7vzda/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_both_the/) — and getting tremendous responses by everyone, I decided to do this more often. Although I am planning to make this a monthly thing, it'd require some time to set it up. I'll've to arrange proper system and channels to ease the process, and have more transparency and automation. I am already on it! ��

---

**UPDATE #4** ���� We did it again everyone! The book is now #1 on the Amazon's 'Most Wished For' list in any category(genre)! [Check it out here](https://i.imgur.com/ozofRlV.jpg)! That's really awesome, you all did it! ��

**UPDATE #3** �� The giveaway is still on, but I'm getting book requests directly on DMs. I've received more than 500 requests through DMs since I posted this. I request everyone to first comment on the post, and then DM me. This is because it'd be easier for me keep track of everyone. Reddit's Inbox is not very helpful, as there is no search bar, and infinite scroll.

**UPDATE #2** ��Each book costed me anywhere between Rs.179 to Rs.348, depending on the edition, availability, and seller's quantity limit. The total number of orders just exceeded 160. There are still many requests left on my list. I'm trying hard to fulfill every request made here.

**UPDATE #1** �� I am going to continue this tomorrow! Good night everyone! :)

For this giveaway, I selected a classic Russian literature:

**Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky**

On Crime and Punishment: Okay, so this is not a light read, it deals with philosophy and moral dilemma. It is complex, dark and gripping. It is existentialism before existentialism, kafka before kafka. I really appreciate its place as early existential literature - it actually does a good job in the epilogue of distinguishing between existentialism and nihilism which people confuse even to this day. His writing does a wonderful job of outlining the inner insanity of a human mind and fully exploring ideas to their most far gone conclusion. Also, his writings are still incredibly modern. Dostoyevsky's brilliance does not reside in his literary style, but in his ability to channel psychological nuance. 
In Crime and Punishment, Fyodor Dostoyevsky explores the vagaries of a human mind, such as those that can drive a man to unimagined levels of insanity. Nietzsche once said about Dostoyevsky, ''He [is] the only psychologist, incidentally, from whom I had something to learn; he ranks among the most beautiful strokes of fortune in my life.""
This is one of those books everyone at least once in their life thought about picking up, but didn't (Just like 'War and Peace') Most people are scared of books like this, and most of the time it's because of the length. New readers might find it a little difficult, but trust me, it'll all be worth it in the end. What first appears as an absurd mystery novel, set in 19th century, develops into a psychological and philosophical journey which brings Dostoyevsky's characters and readers alike to staggering conclusions about themselves. I think this is a must read book, take it slow! 


Quote from the book:
&gt; “Am I a good person? Deep down, do I even really want to be a good person, or do I only want to seem like a good person so that people (including myself) will approve of me? Is there a difference? How do I ever actually know whether I’m bullshitting myself, morally speaking?” 

&gt; ""Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.""

&gt; Log in to you Amazon.in account.

&gt; Go to 'Your Account' &gt; 'Your Addresses' &gt; Click on Add Address &gt; Save your full address including your mobile number &gt; Save &gt; Click on 'Set as Default' to make that address your default [This is important]

&gt; Now Create a WishList, it should be Public and not Shared. Remember to check the box that says 'Third Party Shipping Agreement', when you make the list.

* I'll try to fulfill every request made here. I won't send the book to users who created the account on same date, because that is just abusing the system.

UPDATE:

Ok this thread got more responses than I assumed it would. Alright here we go. For folks who do not know what progressive rock is, I'll leave it to wikipedia to tell you what it is.

[Progressive Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock)

There are so many sub-categories in progressive rock but we'll not get into all the details. What's important is personally I find prog-music is more satisfying, more enjoyable and overall a fulfilling experience than listening to the mainstream genres like Rock and Pop that usually are played on the radio/youtube/TV. I do listen to other genres but I find prog to be far more fulfilling. I think if you stick with it for a while past the initial wtf-is-this-crap phase and once you get used to the sounds and how the songs are composed, you will have discovered a new happy place you can go to whenever you need.

Also remember the older the tracks are, the more experimental they usually sound. And it is possible for you to completely live one sub-genre of progressive rock while completely hating another sub-genre. Don't throw all of prog rock out the window. Give it a shot, I promise it will be worth your while.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal picks for newcomers, proggy but accessible enough to enjoy.

Finally I took the charge and went to sub foreign post office(which is around 15 km from my place). So after wasting my time there,got to to know how they work.

First of all there are tonnes of parcel and hardly two or three people working inside for these international posts(most of them don't know shit).

This is how it works-
1. Your article will be sent there 
2. Someone from the custom will check it and they can detain it for any reason size,weight, electronic, health etc and they don't give a shit whether you are notified or not.
3. Once it is detained ,a local number will be generated for it.I nagged the shit out of India post on twitter so they told me that my parcel is detained and gave me the local number.
4. They will provide you a phone number to call and 99.99% chance is that these people won't pick up the call or will give any idiotic reason or can even lie to you that your parcel is cleared.
5. I got the email id of some superintendent ,who clears the parcel so I have sent them invoice and details, Be careful with the invoice it depends on how much you show to them,if you tell them everything from shipping price to cost of product ,they will charge you on everything they can.
6. I went to the sub foreign post office and asked the in charge about parcel and he told me the same thing that it is not cleared,I told him that the customs is telling me that my parcel is cleared about 3 days ago. He told me nope it isn't contact them. Mind it the customs incharge sits around 20 m away in that office and he went by the Register and told me that it is cleared today only. So other guy I was contacting through phone was lying that it has been cleared 3 days ago. I went again to the same guy, luckily some other incharge was also there and he told me to go to the basement which is actually the dispatchers(they are part of sub foreign post only) ,the lady at the front told me the same thing that it is not cleared but I told her the same thing and told her that the superintendent has sent me downstairs so she told me to  go inside.
7. Inside was another lady who feeds and checks the data after a parcel is cleared,she finally told me that is cleared and will be dispatched in two or three days. I asked her can I take the package with me and I will pay the tax rn but she told me that this is dispatching area so I need to collect it from local post office only.

So this is how it goes. Will wait for 3-4 days now.

Kindly do not start a war in the comments.

Recently I had the opportunity to visit Bangalore and I was very excited about it. I had heard a lot about  the city. People had warned me about the traffic in the city. I was well prepared after hearing so many good and possible bad things about Bangalore. 

The city is great. Almost everyone speaks Hindi, so I had no problem at all. Infact a bus conductor went an extra mile to help me get to the railway station. People are great. Awesome pubs and good locality. Very good quality buses which were very clean and frequent services too. I cannot see such clean buses in my city. 

Traffic indeed is an issue. It is understandable as lot of metro and bridge constructions are going on. Moreover Bangalore is an IT hub so it is understandable that population is very high so the traffic will be an issue. Non traffic rule followers were also there. Riding bikes on the wrong side even on the bridges. Such scenes can be seen in my city as well. As an Indian I am sure we all are used to it. I was residing at a place called Marathalli. The traffic nightmare came true in that area. Signals were jam packed and traffic ran till my eyes could see.  Cabs are quite expensive but the buses make up for it. 

The one thing which really made an impact on me was the issue with **Rs 10 coin**. This thing annoyed me to the core. Not even a single shopkeeper was accepting it. Infact the govt bus conductor refused to take that. One auto guy accepted Rs 50 instead of Rs 60 as I had a Rs 10 coin. A cosmopolitan and India's technologically advanced city behaving like this is really disappointing. Upon asking the shopkeeper said no body cares what Govt. issues, we are not interested in Rs 10 coin so we will not accept it. This sounded quite hostile to me.  PayTM is very handy here. Even a thella wala is having paytm. This shows how digitally advanced the city is but this Rs 10 coin issue is spoiling everything. 

I wonder what the banks in Bangalore would do and is the situation same throughout Karnataka or just in the city. ",,b21hza,,0,,false,1560215710,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,indiamap,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b21hza/my_experience_with_bangalore_aka_bengaluru/,,India,false,Non-Political,

Part of the reason for intelligence failures in 1962 and 1965.


It is interesting to note what Vallabbhai Patel, then Home Mister, had to say about this:

&gt;When I [Patel] became Home Minister, my dossier and those of all the Congress members had already been destroyed, for when I attempted to discover what they thought about me, I found absolutely nothing. They [the British] did not give us any information, either with regard to their past actions, or their manner of procedure, or their secret organizations; in short, they did not let us see or know anything.

I cannot stop grinning now. It's like someone put a hanger in my mouth. I'm smiling at how easy it is to solve all the goddamn issues I faced because the source of problems is me; not anyone else. We keep thinking someone else is the problem but that's not true! I'm amazed and excited by how therapist deduced what my issue is, what caused what and how we could resolve it. It's something I never thought. Posting your problems on reddit won't  help ever; because you're essentially looking for validation and judgements based on some standards and it's unnecessary, those standards, those judgements are of no importance. He has put a whole new perspective in front of me and offered me to resolve it systematically answering all the whys and buts and I cannot be more thrilled for follow up. 

Guys, seriously therapy works! All the shit we're going through; most of the symptoms that are common in our generation can be diagnosed and worked upon. There's a bright day waiting for us all. I'm afraid not all the therapists in India could be of great calibre as mine turned out to be. But if you find that one brilliant psychiatrist, you WILL live happily ever after. No hyperbole!

My therapist is based in South Mumbai, if anyone needs contact, pm me. 

Generally first couple of sessions are devoted to gathering information about you which will help them analyse and diagnose your problem. And that's exactly the time most clients conclude that it's not working and discontinue. But I don't blame them, it's the psychiatrists' and psychologists' job to inform this to their clients. ( Not denying the possibility of commercial interest from their end. ) What makes me say this is I found the contact of same psychiatrist for someone I know; he gave up pretty early. I would also say the effectiveness depends on your ability to grasp psychological explanation and willpower.

Every morning municipal workers visit every home and collect trash. The rule is every house must have a waste basket with trash in it outside the house. Municipal workers have large containers on a trolley which they use to dump the household waste into one of the containers.

When these containers get filled up, a medium sized truck with a small crane will visit and empty the them into the truck. 

Few weeks ago, they've started letting us know that soon we will have to separate organic and non-organic waste. We will have to buy two bags green and blue in color. One of them for organic waste and the other for inorganic. We can already see these color coded waste baskets in public places. They are slowly raising the responsibility on part of households in managing waste. If you don't comply, your waste won't get picked up. When your waste won't get picked up your own neighbors will complain and you will be forced into compliance.

Around 4-5 years ago when Aadhar enrollment was going on in full swing, the government jumped on this opportunity and manufactured many ""tags"" in bulk and struck it on every house. The didn't have any use case in their mind at that time but the definitely had foresight that being able to ""tag"" every house is valuable.

Fast forward today, when municipal workers visit each house to collect trash, [they use a device](https://streamable.com/odou9) to automatically mark that particular house is serviced today. For those that cannot access streamable, here [is gfycat link](https://giant.gfycat.com/TepidWhoppingAlleycat.webm).

Nothing agaisnt the company or the work culture, I just felt I needed break. Over the new years break, I made a resolution to quit and take some personal time off.

On the 2nd of January, I told my manager that I would be putting in my papers. During the closed door discussion, he asked why I wanted to leave, if there was any problem that is making me leave, and most importantly, where am I going. 

I wanted to tell the truth that I’m not joining some other company, and instead would spend the next couple of months staying home, playing video games and getting drunk. But I knew there was no way he or anyone else in the company would believe me. So to avoid all this I said I was joining some random big name MNC.

He asked me what the other company was offerring and I told him a random number, about x% more than my CTC. Dude then goes ‘Hmmmm’ and I think that’s the end of that.

So for the past 1.5 months I was happily serving my notice period of 2 months, looking forward to my temporary retirement. Everyone thinks I’m going to be joining the random company I mentioned.

This week, my manager and another bigwig pull me into a meeting room. They are willing to match the salary figure I had pulled out of my ass if I stay back. I had worked on a couple of foreign clients onsite, and usually the team is rotated every year. They’re willing to make an exception and allow me to continue working on the same clients as well.

27 years old unmarried male. 

*childhood : I was born into a lowe order farmers’ family in one of north Indian states. Mother commited suicide when I was 8 months old.[reasons still unknow]. I was taken by my mother’s family and was raised in a village. I attended Hindi medium government school, cleared 10th with distinction marks. Opted for science in 12th, had to be diagnosed with MDR TB and Kidney Infection. Couldn’t concentrate on studies still cleared 12th.

*Teenage: I had always been feeling the void from absence of parents. I used to compare myself with my friends as they have their parents. After 12th couldn’t afford to study ahead. So, started to help my maternal uncle in his shop. But, I couldn’t be happy. Always felt this is not the place I belong. My father used to work in some other state and earned efficient. Somehow I found contacts of my dad and started talking on phone. He had got married and I got to knew that I have two sisters. I started to feel For them and I fled away myself alone to meet my dad without telling anyone. Somehow I traveled 1900 kms to meet my dad. They(dad and step-mom) behaved very well initially and I had believed that this is the family I had been looking for. Never knew, what I was gonna face ahead. My father denied for my admission in enegineering college stating he doesn’t have enough money. I took a computer course from Aptech, started working parttime to fulfill my needs. Just when I started to work, they asked to give my whole salary to them as they were taking care of me. I was treated like a servant in my home. I had to wash clothes, do house chores. When some guests used to visit us, my mother and dad would not even introduce me to them. This kept going for 8 years. Professionally I worked hard and earned well and gave all to them. 

*Present : Last year I thought, leaving them will be better option. I shifted to a new city. Started my own venture with help from taking loan. Initially I got some success, later I failed miserably in my ventures. After leaving them and my sisters(whom I adored very much) , I again felt the void of their absence. After failing continuously now I am broken financially, emotionally, mentally. I am scared to level that after some days I might not even have money to buy foods and shelter over my head.

I can't seem to get out of the rut or cycle that I'm in right now. For a month and half, I've been living alone in isolation in my hostel with dark curtains all the time just doing random stuff and killing Taliban in Medal of Honor but nothing seems to be working for me.

I stopped looking out for jobs since a month or so because of some rejections and it's just too much for me. Everyone's running like crazy like there's some race going on. So called friends taunt me, ""What you gonna do, Bro. Why don't you have a job? Look at me!"" Well, I know that sucks. I didn't get out of my room for a week after that. I've had suicidal thoughts and still have. For over a month, I have kind of feeling lost in my own small world. I know you'll suggest to go out but my mind doesn't let me. It's jammed. I want to get out of this depressing cycle too. I think societal pressure played a big role on me starting from High School itself. It feels like the more and more I isolate myself, the more comforting it becomes. I missed out on relationships also. A girl used to like me and I think we didn't have quite an understanding, rather a lot of misunderstanding, especially by my side. I don't regret it. I simply can't care about relationships.

This has been happening for quite a long time. Indian parents are pushing their children to get coaching in IIT from a young age. The earliest I've heard was one of my 11th class batchmates telling me that he had been undergoing entrance exam coaching since 8th std. You might know even more extreme cases. An overwhelming majority of these students are forced by their parents and their childhood gets sacrificed.  These students don't get a chance to experience the growing up stage properly and to be well rounded individuals. They are often set up to get depressed in their adult life because they would be working on something they are not at all interested in, or worse they don't have any jobs.

So like the alcohol ban, PUBG ban etc, we need a IIT coaching ban in India since IIT coaching is misused by parents. Once the ban is in place, people running underground IIT coaching centers and parents who send their children there should be arrested by police and then let go with a warning. Repeated offenders should get significant jail time. Any student should feel free to report their parents , if they are pressurized to study for IIT. We can start with the coaching ban in Rajastan. Lots and lots of depressed souls in Kota can finally get relief.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Parents pressurizing and harassing their children and enrolling them at coaching centers against their will is a serious concern. I have seen several instances of this in my life. I am sure many of you would have seen this too. The child protection laws in India is a joke. One of the reasons, I posted this is because we have become a ban trigger happy society having the mentality of banning things we don't like and depriving people who enjoy these things. I understand that there could be some students who enjoy going to the coaching centers. They deserve to be able to go to these coaching centers. The recent events where people were arrested for playing PUBG is ridiculous. I know banning is not the way to go for any of the above cases. But a majority of people are happy or not concerned about these bans because it doesn't concern them. What ban will it take for people to finally wake up?

Calling musicians of all kinds for a jam/recording session TOMORROW, WEDNESDAY the 16th. (If necessary this can also be delayed further into the week). The session will also be recorded in HD video.

Depending on the response I will be calling around to different recording studios and seeing if we can book a few hours tomorrow. If none are available, we will need to set up on our own somewhere else with our own equipment.

Looking for players of any classical Indian instruments, modern instruments, vocalists, producers, technicians and sound engineers,  writers who can help me write chants in Hindi to Lord Shiva, or other volunteers. I will be on the sitar, guitar, and vocals.

If you work as a session or studio musician I am open to paying you for your time.

Direct Influences for the session: [Classical Indian Chants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHxB0upwLqM), [(More Chants)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7NHgDGj3Lc), [Classical Ragas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvkNtyjqOSE&amp;t), 1970s Psychedelic, Jazz and Funk such as [Miles Davis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrPNhcK7T2I), [Alice Coltrane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUxl3DpEZ7w), [CAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahPwfDhAlk), Flamenco music such as [Paco De Lucia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oyhlad64-s). The sound will be an ultimate fusion of east/west, classical and modern. It is important that you understand and feel the sound we are trying to achieve.

We will record improvised takes for as many hours as possible in hopes that we get at least one usable track.

* First was when I visited Kufri last week or so and saw that how many guys were literally just throwing snow balls at foreigners even though they told them to stop. They also pulled them here and there, destroyed their snowmen and took pictures holding them tightly face to face.

* Second was the occasion of Lohri where I was at a friend's colony and how the foreigners who were visiting in group were forcibly ganged up by unkills and aunties to dance with the crowd. Things got out of hand when people really started taking selfies with them even though they looked so uncomfortable. Those people wanted to leave but were unable to as they people were forcing them to dance to dhol sounds. My friend was fed up so he went and confronted the adults and a fight broke out and we had a verbal spat with them. The foreigners thanked us for getting them out of that situation and left never to be seen again.

I can't thoroughly understand why people turn into jerks watching foreigners in front of them. Literally people like these bring shame to all of us.

Only to realize that this time they'd put the GA section way way back with a whole VIP section in the front. 

What more? The GA section was filled with randos clinging on to the railings and the speaker structures to get a better view. Thankfully I am 6 foot tall whilst my friends (5' 9"" and below) had a hard time getting a look at the lights. 

The fact that mobile network connectivity was down showed poor planning, they should've got some repeaters because there was PayTM which didn't work and all the vendors accepted was cash and it's the last thing people have in Hyderabad, I and my friends kind of had to make do with 300 cash (500ml bottle cost 100/- and a frankie cost 200/-). 

The concert felt like a great way to get black money into white. 

There was ample parking and some fuck up related to band distribution but they had the Age Verification counters inside the venue as well which made life easy.

I don't have anyone to turn to regarding the advice I seek.. What can I do with my life now? I have heard differing opinions and my first choice was to choose a regular college... but I don't know if they accept people at my age. To be clear, I can only apply at 24 since I would need to finish 12th this year. Should I choose NIOS for that or something else? Is going to a regular college an option for me?

The other option is distance learning and I have heard polarising views on it. IGNOU would have to be it but is it really worth it? Should I just go to a regular college if I'm able to? 

I'm also stuck regarding what to do for 12th, I would like to do science stream but since I haven't been taught anything for years, the maths and science is expected to be quite tough for me. The other option is humanities, which is easily my strength however, I am looking to study and get into an IT field. Psychology was my preferred option but I would need to study around 7-8 years for to be a clinical psychologist. I don't mind that but realistically, it isn't a great option since I'll be around 30/31 then. So I've decided to go for my second option, I'm trying to study programming on my own and try to get ahead with it. But I'd need a degree, would it be better I get it from a distance learning course or regular? If so, would BCA/MCA or BTECH/MTECH be good? It looks to be pretty tough considering I haven't touched any higher level maths. But, I'm willing to work. Please offer any advice, I'll take anything.

Or do you guys recommend something else for me? My strengths are that I'm good at speaking English and I generally have a good knack with languages. I'm good at subjects such as history, sociology and psychology. I'm good with technology and IT field interests me greatly.",,b4w7e9,,0,,false,1560265762,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b4w7e9/life_at_crossroads_please_help/,,,false,Non-Political,

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday, I go outside, see people in traffic, and then in office. No one cares a fuck about you, people are just following social rules to avoid any problem, no one cares about troubles people are living with.

People are doing suicides, suffering from depression. I live in Bangalore, I see people in traffic daily going with so much pain, I don't know why people are going for so much pain.. Just for survival? Is it really hard to survive in the world? With so much technology, and progress, still we are not happy. All of this progress and technology is a waste if we are in pain.

If you go out to any shop, the way they treat is just for money. They are not happy, people are upset, whole crowd is upset.

I feel sad because if I die like in blink of an eye, no one will care a shit about me, only thing they will care about is money and the headache of taking the body to funeral. I fail to make any relation with people outside so that they will care about me. I am helpless, stuck in this system.

Last night I did not realize that the address selected was of my office and not home because the restaurant I was ordering from was available in both locations.

I realized that I selected wrong address immediately after placing the order when it showed the map. I went on to zomato chat within a minute and requested to cancel the order so I could order again with the correct address.

The customer service refused to cancel the order and said that because of new policy they are not allowed to cancel an order. Even if they cancel the order I wont get a refund.

Now this is just wrong business practice. I understand refusing to cancel the order once it is prepared or out for delivery, but refusing to cancel the order within seconds of placing it does not make any sense.

I appreciate the delivery person to offer me to deliver at my home but my home address is very far from my office address I did not bother him to continue with the delivery and use the food as he may like, give it to someone needy or return to the restaurant.

Just a rant, please verify everything before placing the order on zomato.

He was released a week later at the Wagah Border.","Interestingly he was handed over to India by the Red Cross not Pakistan directly. When asked about his time in Pakistan he said ""It is an experience which is difficult to be described in words. Sometimes I felt that death would have been a better solution"". He was the first Indian PoW during the conflict.

**PS:** The air force operation called ""***Operation Safed Sagar***"" was one of the key factors in recapturing Kargil from Pakistan and the subsequent victory for India. 

It should also be noted that no plane was allowed to cross the LoC which led to serious issues for the IAF and even the pilots had to rely on weaker navigation systems as the US did not allow use of their advanced GPS [which lead to the development of the indigenous NAVIC satellite navigation system] to keep track of the border.

Here's an interesting story of the legendary Cariappa who was captured by Pakistan in '65: https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/when-i-was-a-prisoner-of-war-in-pakistan/295045

There are still fifty-four Indian PoW believed to be in Pakistani jails from the '71 war though they deny it.

Yeah, I'm sure some of you already know this but bear with me because I would've been too young when this happened.

Gulshan started his career as a fruit seller in Delhi's Daryaganj district. He managed to work his way up to starting a cassette shop business, which eventually became T-Series.

I'm trying to find the court judgement as it'd be interesting to see the details. Sounds like the killer they finally imprisoned wasn't proven to be a contract killer - and that the music producer, Nadeem Akhtar Saifi, who was initially accused of it was forced out of India and made an exile. If anyone can figure out where it is, I'd be grateful.

Stumbled upon this after watching [Pewdiepie's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qov0ypksviU&amp;feature=youtu.be), where someone talks about how T-Series is a faceless corp of many people up against a single YouTuber - and a girl says that's not really true, companies can also be started by individuals. Up until now, I'd never bothered to think of T-Series as an idea started by somebody.

We shouldn't have to resort to putting in additional efforts to bypass blocked websites, the Internet should be free. Regardless, this is a way to access said websites in the meantime.

&amp;#x200B;

This works if you are on PC, and uses extensions. **DO NOT USE RANDOM FREE VPN EXTENSIONS IN THE CHROME STORE.** They often compromise your data and may use your connection to tunnel other users' traffic. This method involves using proxies, which themselves may or may not be safe. Said proxies can read all your unencrypted HTTP traffic (not HTTPS) if they wish. However, the method uses selective proxying, meaning that it will use the configured proxy only for the websites you tell it to (e.g. porn websites). Other traffic is unaffected. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next, I will write a bit about how I think Jio is blocking it, just if anyone is curious.

1. For HTTP Connections  
Loading a website such as [http://www.hide.me/](http://www.hide.me/) shows an empty loading page, whose source contains an iframe linked to a Jio IP. (Havent done much analysis on it yet)  

2. For HTTPS Conenctions  
Chrome shows ""connection reset"" method, which means that Jio just dropped the connection / handshake. You may ask, ""HTTPS is encrypted, how does jio know what I am doing?"". This is because, as a way of verifying its authenticity, websites present a certificate signed by a trusted source, which contains the hostname (say [blockedwebsite.com](https://blockedwebsite.com)). Now jio cannot see the data you guys are exchanging, but knows whom you are exchanging with. So it terminates the ""handshake"" (process in which your browser says it trusts the website), and you cant access the page.

If you have other questions, post them here, I'll try my best to reply. Let me know if you'd like a video trying to explain how it works and the technicality of it a bit more.

But I found it. This is my story.,"Visited Allahabad (sorry, 'Prayagraj' is yet to settle in) yesterday for Kumbh Mela. Taking three dips into the Ganga is mandatory. I removed my clothes into the bare minimum and plunged in. Forgot to take off my glasses.

As I emerged from the first dip, I suddenly found that my glasses are no longer with me. It just disappeared. Panic set in. I was the only driver with my entourage, and without glasses, how the heck will I drive back 200 kms to Lucknow?

Then, three types of people emerged, as it happens often with life. A panditji sitting on the make-shift ghat screamed, ""Ab to beh gaya, maharaj. Nahi milega!"" He was pleased, I dont know why. (It's gone now, Mister. Wont get it!)

A lady, who seemed like a pilgrim said it was foolish to bath with glasses on. It was stupid, she said. And she took another dip. We kept on searching under the water, gasping for air, and then again plunging in, to find the glasses.

A man, who seemed like a local boatman, immediately understood the situation. He too plunged in, dived into the water to search my glasses. He calmly asked me where did I stand while taking the dip, and he analyzed the water flow and the wind. For the next 15 tensed minutes, he went into the north-east direction, and some 150 meters away, he finally found the glasses.

We offered him 100 bucks for his help, but he refused. Staring the panditji who had spelled doom, he said, ""Kumbh me sab kuch mil jaata hai.. Sab kuch. Aadmi khota kuch nahi."" And he went away, shouting ""Har har Gange!"" (A man can get everything at Kumbh. Everything. He never looses anything)

Damn. Pretty surreal experience for all.

I lived in India (Hyderabad) for about six months, and I loved the time I spent there. The garbage was one of the most distressing things about my time in Hyderabad. Not even the university I was attending had a proper garbage disposal system: it was all piled up and burned.

I didn't want to sound preachy so at first i said nothing, but eventually the litter started to get to me. When my Indian friends would throw garbage on the ground I'd say ""Pick that up."" Usually they'd laugh, and about half the time say something like ""Why? It's not my job!"" They would usually stop laughing when I stooped down, picked up the trash and put it in my pocket.

But this made me think harder about the problem. Even if I put it in a bin, it just gets piled up and burned. Is that really better? The question changed from ""How could someone do this to their own country?"" to ""How can we put the breaks on this trainwreck?"" There was no waste disposal system, no recycling center or landfill, no proper incinerator and no organized trash collection service. So in reality, even if the trash got cleaned up and put in a bin, what would happen to it then?

I started thinking about my home country as well. We wouldn't have public places being covered in refuse, there would be public outcry. But what do we do with our garbage? We stick it in a hole in the ground and hope it doesn't decompose. Doesn't really sound like a solution, does it?

The problem is bigger than the specific cultural attitudes one country holds about cleanliness in public spaces. We need to totally reassess how we live our lives as modern humans in relation to our biosphere. We need to cut the amount of plastic we all use down to probably a third or less of what it presently is, and find way to reuse and recycle all of that. We need to kill the idea of ""disposable goods."" We need a common, human sense of responsibility to and for Nature.

Obviously, the cultural attitudes about garbage and environmental stewardship on the subcontinent need some work, and people need to take pride in the natural beauty India has to offer, but the larger societal forces at play (fed in large part by consumerism) need to be addressed on a global level as well. If everybody works together, we can give our children a better world than our parents gave us, but it's probably going to be painful. I believe, and this is just a belief, but I believe that if we act locally and think globally, adhere to an internationally recognized doctrine of ""care for each other means care for the Earth,"" and focus our gaze steadfastly on the future, we can only do good.

Anyway, sorry for the rant.

So I chose Agarwal Packers and movers because they were a brand name. I was moving from Gurgaon to Bangalore, and two guys came to pack my things. They were putting things in randomly into boxes without much regard for where things were going. They were doing it so fast, and were in a hurry.



Note: When they put things into the boxes, make a comprehensive list and get them to note it down on their checklist sheet. These guys made very vague comments on their checklist sheet (box#1- clothes, box#2- kitchen etc) and now Agarwal claims that there is no proof for the items that are missing (i.e., there's no mention of an induction on the checklist.) It is important that THEY note it down.



Fast forward to when the shipment reaches Bangalore, and 7 boxes arrive. So my brother signed off the sheet as there were no missing boxes. A week later I arrived in Bangalore. And when I began unpacking I noticed some expensive items were missing, like my induction and mixie, among other things. I immediately call the toll free number.



From then, it's been a roller coaster ride of going back and forth through so many people and departments. And today they told me that since I signed off on getting all the boxes, they can't do anything. I understand, it's a valid thing. But my question is, how can they, a brand that is supposed to be reputed, not have any rules as to how to fill out the checklist or have a system in place that will prevent things like this from happening? I mean, from the time it left my house to go to the Gurgaon warehouse, it remains unaccounted for. And from the time it leaves Gurgaon warehouse till it reaches Bangalore warehouse, it remains unaccounted for. And from the time it leaves Bangalore warehouse till it reaches my home here, it remains unaccounted for. 



It is easy for all parties involved to say that ""Hum toh aise nahi karte madam"" (we don't do things like this, madam)



Just, if you use this service, make sure that every single expensive item is accounted for in their official checklist sheet including detais like which box contains which item.

This isn't gonna be a super in depth post or anything... just wanna get this out there. 

So about at 5th or 6th grade, my parents and grandparents' influence led me to be a full on religious kid. Like mad level religious. I would keep chanting mantras throughout the day in my head cause ""remembering god is essential at all times"". I used to listen to devotional music and other stuff cause ""it's good"". Even then, if I used to slip up in my daily prayers even once, I would be reminded to compensate for that cause I should fear god at all times. (That period was also one of the long lingering aftereffects of the PTSD I had when I was 7 years old and my mom had a brain haemorrhage). All this changed in 7th grade, when I came across a channel called Animax, where I stumbled on a show called Azumanga Daioh, which was just the daily life of 6 high school girls, but me, having entered the weeb phase was like ""omg this is really rad"" and I became a lot happier. I then watched another anime which aired around the same time called sket dance, which I liked at that time, and since I was happy, no one really seemed to have had a problem with it. I also subsequently discovered nightcore at that age which I liked a lot, and now I have watched over 250 different anime and have gone thru the anime fan life cycle and am nearing the end. Even tho I watched only 4 or 5 through entire 2018.

It worked out great!,"So in 2017, I played the matrimonial site game. I also tried dating apps despite the fact it's a complete waste of time unless you live in certain metros. 

I didn't find anyone I was interested in and I felt hopeless. I started to think about what my expectations were and the reality of the country I was living in. Finding someone isn't easy but here the difficulty level was on expert level. Maybe if I was living in Saudi Arabia or a war zone, I'd have a harder task.

So as 2018 was approaching, I told myself I was done. I thought long and hard about the WHY of it all and I realised that for the most part I was doing it because it was expected of me at my advanced age.

Finding a significant other in 2017 had deteriorated my quality of life and I had nothing to show for it. So in December of 2017, I decided I was not going to be checking my matrimonial profiles anymore, I was going to uninstall the dating apps and if anyone asked me when I was going to get married, I'd make sure they learnt not to do that again.

So for a year, I stopped playing a game where the system seemed rigged against me. I didn't waste much time brooding over it. I focused on improving myself as a person. 

It was a good decision and I plan on continuing on this path for 2019 as well. 

Your mileage may vary. But I just wanted to let some of you know that you do have the option of not playing the game.

When I told him Idon't use any of the payment services app, he was extremely shocked.

He asked me why I did not use and I politely replied that I have my own reasons for not using them. He went on huge rant saying that this is 2019 sir, please come live in the modern age like the rest of us. He asked me to please install Paytm and pay the money for the items.

I politely refused again, and he under the impression that I somehow have lived in a cave or something and started speaking rudely remarking this is what all the modern teenagers are doing and you're going backwards. I said No for the third time and walked out as I was in no mood to argue.

He could've very easily solved this situation by asking for change from his neighboring shops(of which there were many).

&amp;#x200B;

Had to drop my kid at school for a short exam and then wait  outside to pick them back. The school is located on a colony road .. which is quite broad ( guess 15m ..  2+2 lane) but does not have a divider.

&amp;#x200B;

And for the next 1 hour, i was entertained by people coming to drop their kids as they virtually entered into a competition 'Who's the biggest Idiot' . 

&amp;#x200B;

\- The winners were Dads and Moms  coming in swanky SUVs / sedans. Poor fellows had to cut the lanes, enter wrong side and park in middle of road so that they could park right in front of school gate . Who would want their kids ( who were by the way accompanied by adults other than the driver) to cross such a broad road. I'm sure they  were troubled a lot because of oncoming traffic who were looking at them with disgust. Screw them .. I'll park where I want.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Runner ups .. ""I'll take U-turn from here only"" . And their counterparts shouting at opp traffic for not giving them way to take a u-turn. So what if the U-turn results in a deadlock as another vehicle is parked in the middle of the road.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The minimum qualification of jumping lanes , shouting, zig-zaging two wheelers were fulfilled by a huge lot

&amp;#x200B;

Sad part is there was no action. Some fist fight would have been more entertaining. **But hopes alive as surely the children will follow parent's footsteps.**

Indians abroad (this is for about 90% of them) are like this:

They mostly mingle with people who are either Indian, or from an asian country for some strange reason, effectively blocking out interactions and experiences that they would normally have, and live in a bubble.

I've lived significant portions of my life abroad. Arabian Gulf, Finland &amp; Sweden.

Every single slur, dirty comment or remark passed about me, my religion, habits, language or culture has been from Indians, in or outside india.

This should say a lot about the sort of people we are. Generalising is dangerous, so don't take this out of context.

Europeans, particularly in the Nordics can be quite 'cold' by Indian standards. You can't chat up random people on the streets, it's just not done.

From experience, i've seen that the Indians who claim to experience racism or instances of intolerance are the ones who don't make the effort to integrate in a new culture. They search for Indians and then, in isolation, bitch about how Europeans are terrible people.

This is by no means implying that some people are not assholes and are racist. Idiots are everywhere. I have personally found people to be more accepting of alien cultures in the West. Indians, on the other hand, tend to isolate you horrible if you don't conform to their standard of what being Indian involves.

Another thing Ive noticed, is that as an individual, they have negligible self confidence. No personality or charisma of their own basically. They are more comfortable in groups, (mostly all guys) which is when they are in their element. You will hardly see an Indian going backpacking alone, or even talking to strangers at bars and making new friends (again this is most of them, not all) Really uneasy when alone is what Im trying to say.

This one time at a bar, there was this group of Indian guys (I dint know them) who were being really obnoxious. For sure they were. I was cringing looking at that table for a long time as I was the only other person who knew what they were saying. It was absolute bullshit. Cat-calling women in Hindi and all. They were politely asked to leave and then they created a racism ruckus.

Also this one time this Indian family had booked this bus I was on. Man they were loud as shit, and then made the whole bus smell of fucking achaar. It was disgusting! and there were no windows also. Everybody was so pissed, and they were finally asked to throw it away. The smell stayed for the whole journey. Obviously they will tell their family and friends that it was racism.

Im not denying that there aren't any genuine incidents of racism, but all Im saying is that a lot of them are self-inflicted.

3. Hip Hop focuses on anger or something wrong around the person. But Indian music directors will force it on romance any how.
4. Hip Hop doesn't focus on *Suur &amp; Taal*, this will now open doors for actors to showcase their singing skills unnecessarily. Now they won't even need auto-tune. (I see Abhishek Bachchan reviving his career here...)
5. Bollywood being Bollywood, they'll achieve new levels of mediocrity with Hip Hop.
6. Back when Pritam was in prime, his song would include random english lyrics popping up at random parts of song. MCing being prominent part of Hip Hop, I am seeing random english lyrics popping up at random parts of songs again.

Let's start with Kids TV.
What would we watch as kids? Great shows like Tom &amp; Jerry, Mr Bean, and soo many Classic Cartoons.
Even the original Indian kid shows like 'Malgudi Days' 'Vicky Aur Vetaal', 'Shaka Laka Boom Boom' (that magic pencil) had some really interesting and funny stories.

Today, they keep broadcasting the same old reruns of just 2 shows, very little variety and laughable quality. They've probably lost their old licenses or something because all those great toons don't run anymore.

 ADULT TV :
I know our old Indian soaps were littered with the classic ""Saas Bahu"" scenarios but back then it was fresh, original and mostly in very high demand. Sadly today's shows haven't evolved much from this central idea. Every major soap has a basis in romance, a possibility of marriage, an obvious anticipation of some twist and the extremely likely event of it getting canceled in less than 2 years. Look at the track record, no show lasts longer and if it does, its probably terrible. 
Unfortunately, ""good content"" is reserved for online outlets which isn't a mass medium in India yet. If a show like ""Selection Day"" had the viewership numbers like a major TV soap, what an impact that would have had,sadly that's not the case.

Reality TV is probably the only genre of entertainment in our TV catalogue that has undergone some significant change. The quality is miles better than anything from before, and there is hope for improvement. 

Being an 18 year old, who used to be an avid viewer of TV and really loved the old stuff, its really disheartening to see the state of TV. None of my peers watch stuff on TV now, except the news or sports. We all prefer online streaming outlets, not just because of the convenience but because of the content. TV in India seriously needs to up its game. 

CONCLUSION: They're still pumping out sub-par content on TV. I don't think the people in charge of Kid's channels even care about what they show anymore. I rest my case, I'm done, I have to study, would love your insights. 

TL;DR: TV content in India is seriously lacking, at an all time low today, quality wise.

Forget their brick and mortar competition like Big Bazaar and More, I've found their rates to be lower than even Amazon and Flipkart! (whom I believed until now to have the best pricing in town). For example, I recently looked up a Preethi gas stove on Flipkart and its price was about ₹5600 whereas the same product was available at my nearest D-Mart for only  ₹5200!

From my observation, I think D-Mart offers better pricing due to following reasons:

1. They purchase in bulk quantities, so economies of scale compared to local kirana stores and smaller shops.
2. They open their shops/malls in the suburb or exterior of a city (Bangalore D-Mart is near Gottigere which is way outside of Bangalore city and near to Tamil Nadu border!). This makes great savings on real estate purchases.
3. They probably don't spend much on furnishing, AC, managers, etc. Their shops look like godowns, are too congested and have only fans instead of AC unlike Big Bazaar and Reliance who spend lavishly on these things.",,ax37or,,0,,false,1560126557,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/ax37or/lifeprotip_if_you_are_low_on_cash_and_want_to/,,,false,Non-Political,

I don't know what to trust anymore and why I am living,"Yesterday I have written about my wife cheating on me and received some suggestions and recommendations from lot of people. Many kind souls have also messaged me personally. Few professional lawyers have also messaged me offering professional support out of pure altruism. I am sorry I couldn't thank you all personally but I went home and got busy.

So today the first thing I've had an early appointment with an investigator who has previously worked with Police in various capacities. I am getting ahead of myself. I should tell you that I have made earlier post from office on my work laptop, just before leaving for the day. Today I called up office and informed that I might not report to work and picked my home laptop and drove up to PI's office. 

While I am discussing, he PI recommended that I'd have my laptop checked and I agreed. After half an hour a young guy (another employee) walks in and I handover my laptop to him. After few minutes the young guy signals through the window and PI walks out and talks to him. They both return back, along with the laptop to tell me the news that my laptop is bugged with some program which saves everything I type and also allows anyone to log into my system without password and use all my applications.

I got worried and asked them if they could prove it to me. So I typed few sentences on notepad and the young guy (computer expert) repeated what I've written back to me word by word. Then I was asked to reboot and the computer expert showed me that he could use my system from his system. Yes I can recognize my folders, files, my desktop everything.And then, he started chrome and it could directly log into all my email accounts. They kindly let me borrow one of their laptops for my personal use while the investigation is underway. 

All this sounds like black magic to me. Am I being tricked here? 

I cannot understand why would my wife do this to me? Everything that I have and do is all her's and children. I'd consider my life to be meaningless without them. Now I am terrified of going home. What do I do? My hands are shaking so much that I can't type. I don't think I will be able to drive home. And I think I have fever now.

EDIT:

All of them are thinking that I am being scammed. I didn't expect that you would think so. May be I should have written this earlier. The computer expert guy showed me logs that are couple of months old which includes websites I have visited three months ago, emails I have written with my words that I remember that go back as far as four months. I purchased some video lectures on one website for my son (udemi), the only time I ever visited such a site that I don't even know about and I have them in the logs. This was around three months ago.

Not only that the company caters services to very very dangerous people that you don't want to know about.

**EDIT:**

I was away talking to other people.

Guys, appreciate all the help that you are doing. It's my bad that I didn't write it in full. I was too devastated to capture everything that happened since today morning. **I am 99.99% sure that I am not being scammed**. Why not 100%, I don't know. I am not sure if you have engaged with professional private investigating agencies. I have (though not for technical activities such as this). The first and foremost important thing is **trust**. That's their bread and butter. Next is references. Even if anyone of you is willing to help me I wouldn't take it. I'll tell you why

1. References. I'll need trusted references from people that you have serviced earlier
2. Can you have all my cards, pin numbers, every piece of information that is mine and still not touch a single rupee in my accounts? Yeah, I'll need references that you are that trustworthy
3. If I keep a 5 meter pile of cash in your custody, can you keep watch for months to end without touching it? Yeah, I'll need references that you are that trustworthy
4. Can you keep life threatening secrets and not leak it to anyone for years on end? Yeah I'll need references that you are that trustworthy
5. You **must not** hire a security agency with whom you cannot trust your laptop let alone extremely personal information.
6. Do you have reach into deep deep political/technical/banking/bureaucratic/law enforcement networks? And all that reach that you have are equally trustworthy?

And there are many many more. None of you out here probably won't qualify ALL of these. The PI that was recommended ticks all these check boxes and more.

And importantly, should I tell anyone that I am being scammed by this agency, I'll tell you that there will be few heads that will roll and few will be dead. No It's not that I would do it. There are much bigger people (few of them that have recommended me to this agency) will immediately catch the wind of it and they would like to protect themselves and **simply eliminate any threat they perceive**, real or not.


The issue here is NOT technical. It's **legal**. Yesterday many people commented that I must not spy on my wife. Today I found that I am being spied on. And unfortunately I could not talk to my lawyer for amount of time today as he was caught up with some personal problem. I was advised by my lawyer get my heath checked up and try to avoid having meals back at home. I was also advised if I could work and live away from home for some period of time till dust settles. 

Could you look at through legal angle and tell me what does this mean? That'll help me while I wait for my lawyer to get free and attend to me.

Thanks and appreciate all the help. I'll be away now and get back online later in night.

EDIT:

My god. Everyone thinks I am scammed. I have read through each of the comments and I did not understand most of them. What can I do?

Overwhelming majority of you think I am being taken for a ride. And there are too many comments talking too many things that I don't understand at all. Can just one of you tell me what to do?


EDIT:

There is too much clutter in this post that I am unable to process. I am sick worried now. Can you help me here

What was consistent across my curriculum was imparting an idea of wanting to make more money, but not even a single minute of how to manage money. 

&amp;#x200B;

There isn't an optional class or training I can pay for to know about how to invest money and this is making us work like donkeys and yet ending up with little money. Sadly, even years after I started earning I never knew about savings. All I was told is, if you have excess money ""FD karlo"" and put some amount of money in RD. These were the people who play safe and who don't want to take even a small risk. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then come the other relatives, the businessmen. ""Beta shares mein laga do"". I was curious to explore this option as I could see that they were doing pretty well for themselves and boasted great returns. When I asked them for financial advice, they told me to go to [moneycontrol.com](https://moneycontrol.com), look at some shares and their 1/2/3 year growth chart and then invest. They suggested some small company of which they don't know ANYTHING, but they've huge money there because ""aage yeh bohot badi company ban jayegi, iska scope hai"". And somehow, these people aren't losing money.

&amp;#x200B;

I nope'd the fuck out. Then there was a tug of war between people who advised me to put my money in debt instruments and people who advised me to put my money in the market. As if being the rope in this tug of war wasn't enough, one other party came! ""Beta, real estate mein laga do"". They want me to invest in a land in a state that I have never been to because ""it is going to be a smart city"". I will probably never visit that state, but they're telling me that they know someone who has invested in land there and the price has already appreciated by 30% in less than an year without progress being done in the city.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe, if there was a single centralised source that could teach some financial literacy to people, I think we could make money make money and retire a little earlier instead of slogging. ;\_;

He's 58, and says that he doesn't have interest in working anymore and that we would also be financially secure if his 2 bosses give him the compensation money when he quits.

Marriage, kids, promotion - it's different for everyone. I wrote this in the hope that acknowledging this obsession might help so many people. 

**Post:**

When I was young, I used to tell my parents, *‘there is probably more to life than studying, getting a job, getting married, settling down, and dying. Watch me, I’ll do something different.’* Ah, the sweet naivety of youth.

I’m at that stage in life, that when any adult comes in contact with me, the same question always comes forth, shrieking violently like a pressure cooker whistle.

*“When will you get married?”*

Forget my birthday. My mother gets asked the same question on her own birthday.

Depending on “where you are” in life, the question varies.

*“When will you finally date someone?”*

*“When are you buying a house?”*

*“When will you bless us with grandkids?”*

*“When will you get a car?”*

To many people in the world, life is a journey with roughly the same milestones, expected to occur in a certain sequence, at a certain time. Like checkpoints in races, where if you do not make it to the next checkpoint within the designated time, you lose the race. Except for the odd rebel, we all have this ingrained in our heads to different extents. The stronger these notions are, the more rigid your expectations become. As the inevitable gulf between reality and expectations grows, the more stressed you will be in life.

This notion of milestones is a gross over-simplification of life. Not only are we all unimaginably different, but the circumstances in each of our lives are mindbogglingly diverse. We’re a bunch of bees buzzing around in a giant jar, and expecting us to fly in a straight line is just bizarre.

It’s not that these events aren’t important. But such is the scale of importance we place on them, that the path between two milestones becomes almost irrelevant.

For instance, consider a woman completing her post graduation. The word marriage explodes in capital letters all around her the second she receives her degree, and the noise doesn’t subside until she hears wedding bells. Each day she doesn’t get to this next milestone, expectations weigh her down. The moment she ties the knot, the next milestone comes calling.

It’s not that these events are not important. They are. It’ s just that, life counts down our days the same, whether we get to a milestone or not.

Perhaps you might feel everyone you know has reached a certain stage, and it’s only you who can’t seem to catch up.

**You are not ahead, and you are not behind. You just are.**

And I’m not just talking to you. I’m talking to myself too. These notions of how a person’s life should be, or is supposed to be, have been deeply ingrained in my bones, something I’m realising only now. For years, I’ve felt incapable and inadequate in so many aspects, because of the difference in my path from others, who are rapidly ticking off those milestones themselves.

I will repeat: **You are not ahead, and you are not behind. You just are.**

*A ten year old kid once went to the carnival with his class. He’d been looking forward to it for a long time now, especially that roller coaster his brother never stopped talking about. Him, and all his friends. Today he would know.*

*The queue was long, but there was no chance he would miss this for anything. When his turn finally came, the conductor stopped him. He was an inch shorter than the minimum height requirement of 5 ft. He insisted, but the conductor didn’t budge. He started to cry.*

*The accompanying teacher saw this unfold, and took the kid for a walk around the carnival. They came by a deserted swing, and the teacher beckoned the kid to the swing. He got on it indifferently. But then he started to swing. The tears were soon a forgotten memory, caressed away by the wind.*

We’ve been that kid, even as adults. These milestones, or life events, whatever you call them, are essentially like that roller coaster. We hype them up, get in queue, and are heartbroken if we don’t make it; all the while forgetting, that there are other rides in the carnival.

Maybe you’ll reach nine of your ten milestones. Maybe you won’t reach the next one in ten years. Either way, hoping desperately to get to the next one, is like standing at that roller coaster, waiting to get taller.

Stop waiting. There’s plenty of other things to do, before our VISA on this planet expires.",,b4g565,,0,,false,1560257807,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b4g565/our_lifelong_obsession_and_pursuit_of_milestones/,,,false,Non-Political,

Today was very hot, and I was profusely sweating. Asked the driver to make an exception and turn the AC on. He refused promptly.

Asked him if giving him some extra cash would change his mind, but he clearly said this is Uber policy and nothing can be done about that.

Well, after the trip was over, I reported this to Uber.

Credit to Uber support, they responded back soon, saying they've no such policy. [Here's a screenshot from email conversation with support](https://imgur.com/HTkVl1p)

Mind you, for the same trip along same route, a public BMTC AC Volvo would cost less than half of what the pool ride costs.

Now, going forward, what should I do when the Uberpool driver refuses to turn on AC? I'd rather not get into an unproductive fight with the driver.

For what it's worth, never had this experience in Ola Share.

Been a chortel service subscriber since 15 yrs now. STB security money worth 2k been looted. Loads of 'value added services' activated without even subscribing/tapping on any sly button on the net, and now this.

Since yesterday, I have recd 2 SMS reminding me of recharing my number timely, else there will be a deduction of Rs 23 (the minimum they would deduct ie). This is my secondary number.

I have calculated and recalculated the days from last recharge, and it is coming to 26 days. They 'grant' a day of 'grace', and I have taken that into account as well.

Another thread here on reddit had mentioned the same issue, and as per discussion over there, this has bothered many others. It is ofc chortel's way to claim a 'glitch' in their system has done this, and 28 days worth of validity would be provided. What is weird is that they have not bothered sending any clarification SMS regarding this issue. This in itself is indicating that they plan to use the excuse of a glitch and lap another round of payments from users.

What should be the procedure to get hold of some responsible official/authority to straighten them up regarding this issue? Any help would be very appreciated!

It’s sickening to see how our news is being flooded with political news with little to no mention of the captured Air Force pilot. I will use my averaging and listener algos to ensure the site stays as impartial as possible. I just want to know the truth, I don’t want any politically backed distorted bullshit, with some dumbass yelling at another person, instead of inciting real conversation and discussing what our next steps are. I want nothing but the hard truth backed with evidence. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone for all your support. I’ll be back in 3 weeks or so, with more updates.

Edit 2: everyone here has pointed out some pretty major plausible problems, I will try my best to answer most of them here:

1. Funding: I’ve got enough money for a couple of months of runway after which ads may be the most logical source of income, as pointed out by many of you. On the contrary to what I said in the beginning ads may be a vital source of income to keep the company up and running.

2. Languages: Our writers will write an article based on the evidence and facts they’ve been presented with, after which, other writers will be asked to check if this has any bias. The writers can write in any of the Indian languages to appeal to as many members of our target audience.

3. Contributions: Like u/mariche suggested, I will incorporate a page where people can contribute whether that be monetary, by writing or by being like moderators.

4. Extra Features: Since many of you have suggested some pretty interesting additions to the site, I will try my best to implement them. Things such as; a news aggregator page, a page to point out inaccuracies in other news sources’ stories, eventually a video portion and also a page where you can submit tips which will be investigated and a social media arm for platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat.

5. Where does the news come from? Right now I think it’ll come from a couple of places; my program when deployed looks for chatter on places such as Twitter, it then looks if other people are talking about this as well, but these other people have to be in another location and have no connections to the first link person this is checked through with as many people as it can, if it finds that a minimum of maybe 10 people are talking about the same thing and they’re not connected then it’ll flag this and forward it to human moderation. Another source of news stories will be through traditional sources like journalists on the ground and tips into the site. These sources will evolve to become more suitable if needed, over time.

6. For people who want to contribute; I’ll be back in about 3 weeks with more information on the site, this is when I’ll start looking for writers and people to contribute to the site. PM me if you’re interested so I can get back to you. For now, thank you for your interest. 

7. What I need: I can do most of the things needed but I have little to no idea about the legal aspect of this, so some legal counsel would be great, right now if possible.

I think that’s all of the questions you guys asked, sorry if I missed any out. I’ll be back in 3 weeks with more information. Thank you all. This is going to be great.

People, both on this subreddit and in general, have expressed everything from frustration to disappoint and even anger at how the news media peddles its wares.

However, there is some fantastic journalism to be found in India, and in a quantity that might surprise you, if you look closely enough.

Having worked in the news media for over ten years, I'm putting this ""guide"" together in the hopes that my understanding of how news is generated will help people find news that is both credible and informative.

Keep in mind that this is based on my personal opinions, so what works for me may not work for you without some tweaking.

**1. Avoid TV news channels like the plague**

The TV news format in India currently is geared more towards being ""infotainment"" rather than informative. It's the whole reason we see so many shouting matches today.

TV news channels currently have very little reportage and are extremely heavy on opinions. What this means is there is very little actual coverage of what is going on in the country.

Opinions are fine under certain circumstances, but cannot be the main source of the news you consume.

EDIT: As u/Valarauko pointed out, Lok Sabha TV and Rajya Sabha TV are not like regular news channels and are actually fairly good places to get news. They are especially useful in that their content is often about what bills and laws are being legislated by our legislative, which is something I touch upon in Point 3. Also, leave a ""thank you"" for u/Valarauko in the comment's section below.

**2. Stick to newspapers**

Despite what you might think/feel, Indian newspapers are (for the most part) still pretty solid in terms of their content. The bulk of any newspaper's coverage today is mainly standard hard news reporting. Unfortunately, most of what is shared on social media does not reflect the majority of this content.

Social media shares tend to gravitate towards more sensationalist pieces, and tend to ignore pieces are more like news articles you'd expect. Front page stories, ""masala"" pieces, etc. Unless you read newspapers thoroughly, you WILL miss out on the bulk of what the news media is covering.

Also, minimise reading ""blog"" type news sites. This includes places like Scroll.in etc. I won't get into the quality of thesen new media sites since that is a subjective thing, but they share one common trait with TV news - they are opinion heavy rather than being reportage heavy. This means they share some of the problems with objectivity that the news channels have.

Opinion based news sources should, at best, serve as your supplementary reading material and should never be the main way you get information.

**3. READ THE LAW/LEGAL PAGES**

IMO, this is probably the single most important point. Law/legal pages tend to by buried deep inside papers and are often overlooked because they are very dry and dull, but are by far the most valuable and reliable way to gain information on any government.

The reason for this is because law and legal news reporting covers things like what bills are being introduced, or what laws might be amended, etc. Nothing can tell you more about our political climate than what bills get passed or how our laws are being changed or what new regulations are on the horizon.

Seriously, read law and legal news religiously.

**4. Understand the target demographics of India's newspapers**

eg. If I want news on what's going on in North India, I will read Hindustan Times (especially pertaining to New Delhi, UP, etc). If I want to read about the North East or Bihar/Odisha/etc I will likely read The Telegraph. If I want news on South India, I'd read The Hindu (especially for Tamil Nadu related news) or Deccan Chronicle.

Newspapers always have a ""core focus"" region, and they do this for a variety of reasons. This means that their coverage of those regions tends to be better than their coverage of other regions. So The Hindu won't be very good at giving you an idea of what's going on in Punjab, Delhi, UP, MP etc.

**5. Read features and other long-format news pieces**

While hard news (ie. the front page articles and all the other small articles that make up the bulk of a newspaper's content) are an outlets bread and butter, their feature pieces are what will help you delve deep into a particular issue or topic, or even introduce you to a new issue that you were never aware off but is seen as being too nebulous to make it as hard news.

Sadly, feature stories are rarely read in India, as people see them as being too long and time consuming.

**6. Put in the effort**

Ultimately, staying informed is entirely dependent on how much time and effort you put into staying informed. This is not the failing of the news media.

India is a massive country with hundreds of issues - from political to social to financial - to deal with. Many important issues that can have significant impact on India's politics and economics are limited to particular regions/states/districts that spill over on the national stage.

Try and devote two hours a day reading the news from a variety of sources. You don't have the read everything, but even just scanning all the headlines in each of the major papers will leave you better informed on what's going on in India than reading only a handful of stories that you deem important.

It is our responsibility as the citizenry to make the effort to inform ourselves of what's going on across the country. What you think is important news is not necessarily important to others.

EDIT: I would request people to share their news consumption habits as well. The way you consume news might help others in doing a better job of informing themselves.

I watched the Samsung official videos besides Unbox therapy and MKBHD's content. I had a basic idea about the phone but then I thought I should get an Indian perspective as well. As one of the biggest phone reviewers, I genuinely thought that Technical Guruji might be a real deal. So I watched his video... Oh my god...

To start of, the low effort was on your face, literally a revolutionary phone and you're still making it in your basic format. The intro line was so badly structured that if a content writer wrote it, he'd get fired. Then the annoying ""Dosto"", and the simple specification reading. I couldn't complete the video, no opinion, no narrative effort just plain and simple but in a bad way.

I was left thinking, is he really what Indians like the most? I'm just sad that so many people in our country are so laid back and unsophisticated that such low effort gets the most exposure whereas other genuinely hardworking individuals get overlooked.

First, the stated arrival time before we book is almost always wrong. The app shows something like '2 minutes away' and right after you book it climbs up to 5 sometimes even 10 minutes.

Second, the drivers fucking don't move unless you call them up. And the conversation always goes 'Kahan jana hai, sir?' (What's the destination, sir?) Bhosadike, if you signed up on a platform, at least have the decency to offer service by their rules. And, since this seems to be such a common issue, why doesn't Uber simply disclose the destination before they accept the trip.

Third, there are drivers who say they are coming, make you wait for 7-10 minutes and then cancel. Is this some kind of revenge for riders who cancel when drivers are moving towards them? Or, is it because there's some kind of penalty for drivers cancelling trips? Do they do this in hope that customers will cancel? Bhosadike, just tell me to cancel when I call you.

Fourth, pool riders who have no consideration or empathy whatsoever for other pool riders. There should be a special place in hell for people who book a pool ride sitting on the 69th floor in a corner building of their 420 acre corporate campus with no cab entry. Then, they usually look for last mile connectivity in to the middle of buttfuck nowhere with no roads. And son, why on earth would you book a pool ride if you're already running late for you flight or train?

Finally, their feedback system is absolutely useless. The option to choose 'bad co-passenger behaviour' is simply absent for pool rides now. In general, all feedback beyond the five stars is just categorical. There's no scope to write qualitative feedback even after we select 'other'. Considering Uber's capabilities in machine learning, one would assume they'd like to apply some kind of insight recognition algorithm on all the qualitative feedback they'd get.

At this point of time, the only reason to stick with Uber is because they are marginally better than Ola.

1553263033,india,[deleted],self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b45dha/the_problem_with_the_indian_judiciary_which_so/,6,31,,,The problem with the indian judiciary which so many blindly respect are staggering - insider's view,"Justice in India is often delayed. There are many causes for this, but one of the causes is one that has never seen public attention. I'm going to tell you what this one is.

Judgments of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts are binding on the lower courts and, to a great extent, on the aforementioned courts in the future. More often than not, these judgments are presented to the courts to convince the judges.

Until 1970, the judgments of both High Courts and the Supreme Court were of adequate length. These judgments were easy to peruse and were on point. I don't know what happened, but after 1970, a majority of the judges started writing longer judgments, fluffing them up with completely useless content. Where judgments used to be 5 pages long at most, now most judgments are above 10 pages long. Worse, the average size of judgments is gradually rising. The other day, I read a Supreme Court judgment of 10 pages, of which the first 9 pages had nothing to do with the 10th page, which was the only page that talked about the final order and the reasoning behind said order.

The consequences of this blatant /r/iamverysmart attitude of the judges of the upper courts are staggering.

The amount of time they waste on writing such long judgments could have been used on deciding cases.

They set an example for the lower courts to waste needless time on longer judgments than are necessary.

Advocates find it much harder to study these judgments and consequently find much lesser time on their hands to prepare for their cases.

The judges of the lower courts waste a lot of time going through judgments presented by all parties before them, and often get confused due to the staggering length of the judgments.

The organizations reporting judgments of upper courts find themselves with far too many big judgments to go through, and consequently are unable to produce summaries for most judgments. Even the summaries that they produce are often inaccurate.

Given that I was judged in exams in high school and college on the thickness of my answer sheet as much if not more as the content, this does not surprise me. We are not laconic. Our Constitution itself is ridiculously verbose. We still hold the record for the longest speech in the UN. It took me a long time to unlearn the verbose way I was taught to write letters, which I carried over to emails.

I honestly think we should start a non-government, non-profit watchdog for compiling, analyzing and recording everything that the judiciary does. We know almost nothing about our third branch of the Government.

The *Dadasaheb Phalke Award* is considered to be the highest honour in Indian cinema conferred at the National Film Awards for ""outstanding contribution to the growth and development of Indian cinema"". Instituted in 1969 by the govt to commemorate Phalke's contribution to Indian cinema, it has a legacy which makes it very prestigious in the consciousness of the public. 

So I was extremely confused when I started seeing [news articles](https://i.imgur.com/5XCltkh.jpg) about ""Vicky Kaushal wins Dadasaheb Phalke Award for Best Performance in a Leading Role"". Followed by a Dadasaheb Phalke Award for RJ of the year category. The most bizarre development was seeing [Amit Bhadana celebrating his win](https://i.imgur.com/2xOA8Fh.jpg)  for the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for ""Best YouTuber"". But on closely checking I noticed it's actually the ""**Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival Awards**"". This is not affiliated with the Directorate of Film Festivals (responsible for the National Film Awards and the International Film Festival of India) but a new festival created by a private entity. Since a lot of news sites have not bothered to list it correctly- many of them shorten the title so it is easily confused with the most prestigious film award in the country.

I was curious to see if it's out of ignorance and for the sake of convenience or an intentional push by the organizers to confuse it with the original award. And it seems to be a bit of both. 

On their official verified Instagram account- they directly refer to their own awards as [Dadasaheb Phalke Awards](https://i.imgur.com/RdjjHc0.jpg). On checking out their website the first thing you would notice is their tagline- ""India's Most Prestigious Awards Night"". On their [About](https://www.dpiff.in/about/) page they actually carry an [endorsement by our hon'ble PM Narendra Modi](https://www.dpiff.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PM-Message-to-Dadasaheb-Phalke-Internl-Film-Festival.jpg). It is very obvious they're trying to make it look as official/govt backed as possible. A lot of thought has gone into making this look legitimately like the ""official"" award. After this I decided to check up the Ministry of Commerce's public list of trademarks and to my surprise they had actually attempted to register [Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival as a trademark.](https://i.imgur.com/iOykNZ8.png) Since the current status is abandoned- it is possible the applicant did not follow through with more formalities with the registrar or was denied straightaway.

While looking up into this International Film Festival I also found out that this is not even the first entity to try to abuse the system using Dadasaheb Phalke's name. There's a-

* **Dadasaheb Phalke Film Foundation** too which gave [Guru Ram Rahim Singh an award for *MSG*.](https://www.indiatimes.com/entertainment/celebs/guru-ram-rahim-wins-an-award-for-his-film-msg-we-wonder-if-the-earth-has-stopped-spinning-253985.html)
* [**Dadasaheb Phalke Excellence Awards**](https://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/dada-saheb-phalke-excellence-awards-2018-winners-shahid-kapoor-rajkummar-rao-5147152/) which sees a lot of Bollywood A-listers in attendance. 

The Dadasaheb Phalke Academy also gives out awards sporadically and seems to have the approval of the late filmmaker's grandson Chandrashekhar Pusalkar but I couldn't find a lot of info on it. 

But what stands out about DPIFF is that unlike these other award functions who usually add something to the name to separate it from the original honour, these guys officially call it the *Dadasaheb Phalke Awards.* 

Just wanted to share my findings for more awareness because I've seen a lot of well-educated people fall for shoddy reporting too. Next time you see a Dadasaheb Phalke related award, do a double check.

He was a good student in the school level. However, his family fell in financial trouble due to the premature demise of his father, the only earning member. So, he decided to join the army after completing 10+2 in PCM.

He was recruited as a soldier in the technical branch of artillery. Now, he has 10+ years of experience in the army and the rank of an NCO.

He was posted in various parts of the country including Kashmir and the infamous Siachen. His main roll in the artillery is to calculate the trajectory of a shell fired from a gun (canon).

He is a cool guy and a real gentleman. I have heard many stories from him which I unfortunately can't publish here.

He was in vacation during the Kashmir terrorist attack. So, his leave has been cancelled and he was called back to duty.

He is a soldier and ready to give his life for the nation. However, he is not fond of war and bloodshed.

Bless him if you can. Jai Hind.

Edit: Thank you all for showering love and encourage for my friend. So, I'll add some more facts about him.

He is married and is a proud father of a baby girl. He loves his Royal Enfield bike and also to chill with friends.

In ""Meghdoot"", Yaksh describes to clouds in detail, her fiancé's body.

The regular Boeing  737 aircraft (NG models 737-600,700,800,900)  are one of the safest planes ever made. The main thing that is the cause of concern between the older models and the new MAX models is something called MCAS system which has several automated inputs.


Now China, Singapore and Indonesia along with many operators around the world have grounded this aircraft. The US has said it is safe to operate these aircraft but it's most likely to protect Boeing  and the money the US makes from them.



Indian DGCA has not taken any strong action against operators flying this aircraft. The plane still flies in India.

I did my engineering in something which i didn't love very much, got the branch and it too late to undo the mistake. I wanted  to work with computers but my branch wasn't exactly made for that, neither i could afford one to learn and look for jobs in IT. If it wasn't for the scholarship, I couldn't have afford to pay the fees for college. 

I thought ok and I'll look for jobs through government exams and ibps since I didn't really like working as someone from a core branch anymore and what could lift my family out of poverty other than a stable job which they offered. 

Fast forward 4 years later, I still haven't gotten a job. I can't look for jobs based on my degree because of the 4 year gap and I don't remember shit I studied.

And there comes my alcoholic and abusive father in picture, who acts supportive for one day and then gets drunk everyday, curses me and won't let me eat or sleep or study. This has been going on since last 4 years and I've been only tolerating, hoping one day I'll get out this shithole. My mental health has been shit and I've thought about taking my life everyday but it won't do anyone good. I've lost weight, It's barely above 50 and i can't eat more than 4 rotis in a day. I don't feel hungry anymore and every idiot who comes home says ""wHy DoNt YoU EaT, YoU LoOk LikE SkeLeTon"".

Now my father don't even need to be drunk to fight and curse everyone at home and blames us for his failures which he has been doing since last 24 years. It has gotten worse and I'm not sure I can survive this any longer. I can't even leave home because I don't have money or anywhere to go. I feel clueless about what I should do.

I was hoping to buy a computer and learn being a front end web developer and look for relevant job, hoping they won't care about the long gap. And data is also affordable now and there are lots of websites who help you learn for free but my broke ass hasn't been able to afford a get a cheap working computer or neither I'll ever get any support from home.

“Question” is when you need more information.

I gained weight and hated each second at the job. My OCD and anxiety overtook me and I literally realized what is internal conflict and overflow of emotions.

It was like every little thing was going haywire, I was not earning well. I wanted to build my portfolio but then did not know what to do. When your family is it self crumbling with emotional issues the only thing you can do is deal with it alone and that is not the best feeling in the world. I finally quit my job, a big MNC where I was destined for better pay but because of the onset I was spending up to 12 hours on the job and lagging behind because of no interest. I quit and finally took my life in my hands. I sat at home for an year, rolled myself into a course which took me 2 hours each day to go and visit. Came back home, studied and lived a physically comfortable life. I taught myself the things I wanted to always and changed my industry that way. I was never a CS guy going by my educational background. But I now I am working in IT.

That 1+ year helped my knowledge, I used to sit up nights coding and learning and listening to music. I learned slowly but I did. I finished that certification and got a job in around 1.5 years later since quitting my last job. This job was paying me no where close to what another guy in the same industry would get, just because I had no relevant experience. I took the offer just to gain experience. In the meantime my physical and mental well being started showing major signs of deterioration. I had gained a significant amount of weight, because of good home food and lots of stress.

&amp;#x200B;

Then during the latter half of 2017 my life completely changed for good. One day I got up and after being depressed and locked in my room for 4 nights, I told myself that enough is enough. I started one thing that changed my life completely. I started working out.

Cut to right now, one thing led to another and now I am outside India working and earning better. I had never lived alone my entire life and here I am learning and exploring more about myself more than this new country and its culture. Dealing with different people and **being more grateful for a life I wanted to end at one point of time**.

&amp;#x200B;

My 2 cents:

1. Thinking positive is very important, **what you think you become**.
2. Working out is not about gaining abs, working out helps you mentally more than physically specially if you are going through mental issues. When you work out, your mind is occupied and relaxes while your body works out. **I lost 17 kgs in 3 months. I not only got fitter but disappointed a lot of people who never believed in me.**
3. Music helps a lot. I cannot say how much music has been a help for me. As I have changed, so has my taste but **a good tune can reveal and make you learn so many things about yourself.**
4. **Share your problems**: I finally had the balls that week in 2017 to speak to it to one of my family members. They had no clue it was anything this bad. They knew I was an introvert but this made them understand me better. And I got even more support. Believe me when I say that your family is your best friend. They will always be by your side when the world is against you or even when you are. Friends are rare, keep them close specially the good ones.
5. **Pour your thoughts by art**: Write, sing, speak or even discuss. It helps. But do not do it on Facebook. That place is for drama and judgement. Reddit is the best for this I suppose. But I would recommend doing this in real life.
6. Believe.
7. Savor the small things in life before they are gone. When you see someone smile when you are depressed, it does help a little. **Since I lost someone and saw him burn infront of my own eyes I have made sure I make my close ones know how much I value them.**
8. And finally, **TRAVEL ! EAT ! and keep yourself BUSY**! Being busy is an art.

Thanks.

My name is Walid Ansari and my mother, Rizwana Shireen, has been suffering from arthritis for more than 6 years. We are from a small town named Jamshedpur and we belong to the middle class and dont have much savings. 


We have taken her to almost all the doctors that anyone has recommended but none could give relief to her pain. Initially she didn't have a lot of pain but as time passed the pain kept on increasing and increasing and in the past 6 years she has many times not been able to move from the bed on her own. Now the pain has increased to an extent that she cannot bear it, sometimes she just sits and cries. If you think the worst pain that a person can feel is during a break up or something then I hope you never see your mother cry while you are able to do nothing about it. 


After consulting a lot of doctors and a lot people We have decided to take her to Vellore, CMC Hospital, that's cheap and has a good rheumatologist that can treat her. The expenses are gonna be a bit too much for us as we only have a dry clean shop that we opened by taking a loan which we are still paying at EMI 9000 a month. The treatment expenses estimate that we have got from a few doctors is about 1 to 2 lakhs as the treatment will include a lot to tests and it will be a slow process so we will have to be at Vellore for quite sometime. 

I believe we can pay the treatment expenses somehow by borrowing money and selling some unnecessary stuffs from our home but it would be really helpful if we could generate 25000 through this fund raiser which can be used for traveling to and staying in Vellore. I'm thankful to a specific community that really helped me gave me a lot of hope and strength for coming here. That's all I wanna say and even if you cannot contribute to this fundraiser I ask you to just pray for the better health for my mother and for that I thank you..


On the previous post there was a rheumatologist who said that he'll treat my mother for free but for that we'll have to travel far from my place what is not possible... As I cannot just ask my mother im such condition to travel far off to meet a doctor I met on reddit.. I hope you guys understand this... Please help guys

I'm writing on behalf of one of my closest friends from college. Let's call him Bob. Bob has a physical disability, he is visually impaired / blind. He is currently a working professional and enjoys theatre, movies and video content (Amazon Prime Video / Netflix) like most of us.

Earlier, Bob would prefer Bollywood over Hollywood primarily because the former was full of dialogues and a lack of vision did not affect his understanding of the story. He sometimes goes to movie theatres with an able bodied friend, who can narrate to him what's happening.

The introduction of Audio Description by Netflix India in its web content has drastically changed his experience for good. It has filled in the lacunae that there were in story line, because of lack of vision. Now, his playlist has Hollywood shows (mostly Netflix) including House of Cards, Narcos, etc.

While Amazon UK has introduced Audio Description in a lot of its content, Amazon India has not. When he spoke to a customer care executive, their response was that Amazon India membership is not as expensive as the UK one and it was impractical to expect a feature like Audio Description at such a membership price.

The process of audio description for movies is not very expensive. But it is not usual practice in India, which has over 8 million people who are visually impaired, some of whom are direct customers of Amazon. What can we do to convince Amazon India to introduce Audio Description in Prime Videos?

We have thought of:

1. Writing representations to Amazon India Heads, including Head of Content.

2. Taking it through celebrities of Bollywood, requesting their support to the campaign.

3. Online petition platforms, like [change.org](https://change.org).

4. Through NGOs who work for such causes.

Are there any other ways we can make this happen?

The recent coverage of the Balakot strikes and subsequent air battle over Kashmir and the 'source based reportage reminded me of a previous incident in Indian journalism. Back in 2008, a blogsite dedicated to uncovering ' the rotund flanks and the shaggy underbelly of the Goan media' pulled off a hoax by which they convinced several newspapers and websites including TOI, Indian Express, New Indian Express, Telegraph that an 88 year old Nazi war criminal named Johannes Bach had been arrested at the Karnataka Goa border by Perus Knarp the ""intelligence wing of the German Chancellor's core"". Bach had apparently been responsible for the killing of 12,000 Jews in the ‘Marsha Tikash Whanaab’ concentration camp. The email contained a press release that claimed that Bach had revealed his identity to a holidaying Israeli couple during a rave party in Goa, and had stolen an 18th century piano from a museum in ‘East Berlin’ which he was trying to sell through a local newspaper.

Of course none of this was true. Perus Knarp was an anagram for Super Prank. The picture in the press release was that of a old white man picked out of the internet at random and Johannes Bach is of course a famous 18th century composer. None of this however stopped multiple reporters from rehashing the release, quoting intelligence sources and making up lurid details that only existed in their imaginations.

Following the revelation that they were hoaxed, no one seems to have analysed how they were fooled so easily. Some of these journalists are now editors and one was still providing breathless coverage of the recent Balakot attacks, where he continued to churn out more 'sources say' copy.

&amp;#x200B;

5 Years ago, I was in class X, I was smashing at life, my overall life was really great, it was the best I could have done at that time, I know people are biased towards calling younger times better, but for me, it really really was, compared to now. I was in the top 10 at my school, the biggest school in my city, great at activities, my parents were really happy too.

&amp;#x200B;

My life has only went downhill after class X. I ruined my entrances, partly it was me, partly it was my environment, should have gone to a better city for preparation, Kota or Pune I guess, like most of my friends who were good at studies. I'm in my 2nd Year of Engineering, IT, doing it from a Tier-3 college :L.The environment here sucks, the kids don't want to do great things in life here, most of them play video games all day. While my friends from school are in IITs, BITS, NITs. College is, some say, best time of one's life, not for me, I'm miserable :(

For my career:

I have a serious hobby.

I'd love to take that hobby as a full time career but it's really risky, which is becoming a music producer, my plan for this is, I'll keep giving this time, next year or so, if things pick up great, then I'd do it full time. I'm definitely not an  amateur and can produce most of the mainstream-pop that you hear today. But if things don't work out really great, life will suck and become mediocre and I don't want that at any cost.

Hence, if things don't start picking up in the next year or so-

&amp;#x200B;

I'd work and try to emigrate.

The only thing I'm proud about myself from this period is, that I've learnt work ethic and can work hard.

This gene makes bacteria resistant to regular strong antibiotics and it kills half the patients who develop a blood infection.

The antibiotic - Colistin (Doctors call it the “last hope” antibiotic) is used to treat patients who are critically ill with such infections resistant to nearly all other meds.

In India at least five animal pharma companies openly advertise products containing ""Colistin"" as ""growth promoters"". Their continued use in farming increases the chance bacteria will develop resistance to Colistin, leaving it useless when treating patients.

One of these companies is also a major poultry producer. Apart from selling animal medicines and creating its own chicken meals, it also supplies meat directly and indirectly to major fast food chains in India.

So got a craving for meat? At the very least pick mutton over chicken ... and avoid eggs, if you like living.

Me: ""Yeah sure, why not? Just don't hit it up here again, and please don't break anything okay?"". 
Kids: ""Yes! We won't, promise!"".

But then, they go looking for office jobs and pencil pushing.
The value the students themselves have for their Degrees is very less. Meanwhile, if you look at anyone from the west, you notice that they flaunt their degrees. They take pride, even if it's a Bachelor's degree. 

Not just that, I study in a private university. And the attitude we have towards our degree is so different from what others have. When we work on projects, we meet students from govt. Universities, who seem like they are almost ashamed of what they are doing, the only exceptions being IIT and IISc students (IIT students are usually just too full of themselves and annoying).

I am not sure why that is. 
Is it the society... That makes studying pure science sound like some 3rd class filth?
Or is the the institutions themselves?  
Most universities in India, teach shit. And make the subject boring AF. Not emphasizing in its importance or research aspects. 

Which was the case with my Bachelor's Uni. It sucked.

But in my current Uni, we have great professors. Nice rapo. Great environment to work with. And we feel cool doing what we do.

I don't see this kind of 'ohh.. Yes.. I am studying this.. yes.. my life sucks' kinda attitude from anyone else. Only students of science  (and sometimes arts) from almost all govt. Universities and colleges.

* Use a VPN, there's some good one like NordVPN which is paid but if you are using it for browsing oniy then I'd recommend [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com) which is free (limited servers). 



* [On router] Use a 3rd party private DNS like Google, CloudFlare or Cisco OpenDNS. It's easy to set up on your router. Just find the option for custom DNS and add 1.1.1.1 as primary and 1.0.0.1 as secondary. This is Cloudflare's DNS and privacy friendly. 



* [On mobile] If you are on pie the you can use the private DNS option. Here's a [guide on how to enable that.](https://blog.cloudflare.com/enable-private-dns-with-1-1-1-1-on-android-9-pie/). In short simply head over to Network &amp; Internet &gt; Private DNS &gt; Use the 3rd option and add 1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com. Go to https://1.1.1.1/help to see if it's working. 



For Android versions below Pie you can use 1.1.1.1 app that's available on Playstore.

Is this worth doing? Their website does list the intern positions, but the qualification is Btech/Mtech and duration is 6 months and I can only do 4 months so I really don’t know. And it says it’s a paid position, which usually means that I am the one getting paid. But they emailed me telling me I have to pay them?? Basically is this normal, reddit?

less and less of stuff that binds people together and more and more divide.

Today, I watched tv after ages, and indeed some of the news channels are rabid. The discourse decides the outlook.

When people talk about 'revenge' and 'religion' day in day out, it seeps into the public discourse

and then into our outlook as people. We are becoming a sad, frustrated, and anxious nation.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone mentioned yesterday that the situation in Kashmir was very much stable during 2003-2013,

the number of deaths to be significantly reduced from 4500+ to mere 250+ .

Things had started to look better but suddenly we are back at ground zero. Also, did anyone notice the poor quality

films that are being made to serve populist view point-- hell, even Kashyap has started to make fuckall movies.

You go into a theatre, you stand up for the National anthem and you watch a highly dramatized--supposedly nonfiction--war but not really a war movie.

Shouldn't we ask ourselves what we are consuming? They are making a film on it because they know it sells. Patriotism is a commodity in India these days. The channels sell it, and people buy it--mostly suburban-lower-middle-class population which is huge.

&amp;#x200B;

The real matter always \_ALWAYS\_  gets sidelined. We are 100 times more populated than a prosperous Nordic country.

I realized that in my youth while figuring out why there aren't any jobs. Nobody talks about that.

But we talk about Mandirs on national tv, screaming over each other. We talk about war.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember one incident, I was walking back from my office with one of my colleagues, the city was shut down over Tipu Sultan Row, we saw a mob nearby and I flinched, and suddenly my friend said: ""It is a hindu mob, no issue, had it been Muslims, \*\*\*\* would be setting fires to everything.""

&amp;#x200B;

I was not really shocked because these prejudices have been with all of us since a long time and one has to grow out of it,

but never before I heard someone say something like this so casually.

1551103471,india,globalwaffles,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aulkyc/to_all_the_people_who_are_depressed_unmotivated/,205,1095,,,"To all the people who are depressed, unmotivated and struggling to make it out of bed","I’ve seen a lot more depression posts on here than usual. First of all my DMs are open to talk vent or rant. Long post but hopefully you’ll find some inspiration at the end of it.

- I dropped out of engineering myself, you can check my post history to a couple of years or so ago. I dropped out of engineering in my third year at pretty good college. Restarted it in my second year when my parents refused to fund any other discipline of education. I did my engineering at a shit private college. I was sad and depressed too and all I did was come home, sleep, pass the day, etc. fast forward to today, I’ve spent a year at top 3 International university after being invited, and I’m heading to Estonia for my masters, completely free and even a decent stipend to take care of my expenses there. It was a long journey, but I struggled like the rest of you. 


- **To all of you who are depressed, unmotivated and in bed all day, I would recommend doing something as simple as taking a shower**. A warm/cold shower (however you prefer) is so underrated and can help you just get ready enough to do do something more, or at least get you out of bed. There have been so many times that my feeling of ‘bleh what a day’ turned around after a shower.


- **Cut out the porn and the jerking off. It’s going to push you into a deeper hole without making you realise that it’s happening at all**.
Masturbation is fine, so is porn. Just don’t indulge to pass the time is all.


- **Small achievements can go a long way. Try and learn how to make a nice omelette for yourself. Re-arrange your cupboard maybe? Re-order your bookshelf? Clean the dirt off your shoes? Water your plants? Any of these is something positive you did for yourself or your household. Congratulations. **


- Depression is very complicated, so there’s no fix all solution as there are infinite reasons that can lead you to this road. I’m going to try and address those who feel unproductive or feel they can’t do much professionally or education wise:

- **A lot of the times, we get depressed because of conflict in fulfilling what’s expected of us and what we actually want to do, my only advice is this: Everyone dies**. **Yes, taking up a job which isn’t mainstream might seem embarrassing in the moment, maybe your parents are upset or worst case disown you. But we’re talking about getting you out of the mindset to take your life or wasting it away.**
**You may push yourself to do something that people/parents or society want but not you, then everyone will die, and you’ll be stuck with your choice for 30-40 years, unhappy. **
I’d rather you risk 5-7 years of discomfort, take a risk, or start at the bottom somewhere and grow and learn. Get beyond the confines of the education system if you suck at it. Live life on your own terms. 

- Also, It helps no one if you want to be a high paid exec but spend your day binging Brooklyn 99 or reruns of Big Bang Theory. __Either adjust your dreams to your effort or your effort to your dreams. A disconnect will only get you down further.__

- Story time: A friend of mine, girl, ran away from her house after she was verbally and physically abused by her family for not getting a job. She was 23 at that time. She had around 19k in savings, walked around and found a job as a night desk attendant after a week in a local chain hotel reception. She managed to find a place to stay with 5 other people in a very (VERY) small flat, so she could pay less rent, she ate shit food and lived in shit conditions, but she learned and grew on the job, by waiting tables and cleaning and doing additional duties. She grew and now she’s managing the hotel and running a bar owned by the owner of the chain on her own and earning more than most people I know at 28-29. This woman would call me almost everyday depressed and crying, to see her where she is now makes me very happy.

- **So yeah, her family hated her, her relatives hated her for being a receptionist** and a dishwasher and a waitress, she risked A LOT for 6-7 years, but she decided to work her ass off out of that situation. 

- **Doing productive work isn’t too hard. You just need some momentum. Try and have no zero days. If you’ve got a shit ton of work piled up, resolve to do some portion of it.**

- Do enough that the future you (of tomorrow, of next week, of next month) can thank the past you for being an awesome bro/sis and doing your part of the load. So no zero productivity days. Feel free to DM. 

**PS: Redditors can at the very most sympathise with you and tell you that everything is going to be okay. Very few would be more generous than words of support. Everyone will move on with their life and in the end, it’s only you and your hustle. Solution takes time and you’ll probably be out of the rut, but it’ll take time. Be patient.**

Edit 2: Thank you for the gold stranger; if anyone has the urge to guild this post, please donate to the CRPF, they need it more. Regardless, thank you to /u/theawkwarddev for the gold &lt;3. Also, everyone below saying that they needed this, I urge you to keep sharing your stories. Maybe it does not garner the attention of a lot of redditors,or it gets buried, or maybe you're scared you've not articulated it enough. Keep sharing because sometimes, an individual can help you gain perspective and you may never know where you get the greatest help. Please also use the regular depression and discussion threads. Thanks for the gold again.

As per the news, he was repeating his 3rd year of law school. NLS has lost many students to suicide over the years and has been unable to do anything about it. This is the time for us to realize that we need to take the initiative and create an environment where people feel connected with each other. We need to listen and be there for one another. We need to ensure that we have created a space in which one is there for the other. We will have to make a space where we can relax and feel homely. I strongly feel that we must do this at the right time, because we know that there is nothing effective that our university does for our thoughts. We do not need to lose someone to wake up to this. I believe that we have the power to prevent this and create an environment where people feel safe and as a part of a community.

So once in every two days the ladies gather along with me and take the pictures and start filtering out. Their discussions during the filtering are horrible. Shamelessly I will quote some of them.


1) The girl is not fair. The next generation won’t be fair then. 

2) Her father is from poor background, he won’t be able to give dowry more than 5 lakhs 

3) Structure is not that good. 

4) Either shape of nose/mouth/teeth is bad. 

5) Has a big bum.

None of them care about girls view/attitude towards job, her compatibility with me in terms of my occupation, her religious views, sexual compatibility. 

Once in every two days this happens and the next day we go to see the girl personally. They make me and that girl sit face each other and then when I see that girl, I reminds me of the dirty discussion that ladies made a day before. 

I am feeling irritated by this attitude.

[I killed a newborn kitten unknowingly],"TLDR: A cat gave birth in my home, I prevented cat from entering thinking it wanted food and today I found a dead kitten. 

I live in a apartment in a ground floor. Its a nice clean 2 BHK flat. I been living for 2 weeks alone as my roommate went home. We have got a lot of stray cats in the area. For three weeks or so a fat looking cat has been getting in the house through the windows and its not shy even though I am right beside the window. I tried to feed it biscuits even Oreos thinking it might like the milk taste of it. I also thought cats are stubborn and they are picky in food. But for last week it been really tried entering the house. Even though I would close the particular window from which it generally came it would around the house and find another window. Also I would close the kitchen door as I didn't wanted it to mess with the food. So three days ago it came 5 in the morning after I slept at 2 am and started meowing pretty loud and it pissed me off so waited for it leave and closed all the windows. From that day I would close all the windows all throughout the day and it would sit just outside the windows meowing loud. 

As I have been living alone I don't cook so don't visit kitchen that often. But today afternoon thought of cooking and found a rotting smell from cupboard at the bottom of kitchen which I very rarely open and its got a side opening to it. I thought maybe its a dead lizard as its common but it was a dead kitten. 

I am really disgusted by my act. Also another cat would try to come and I thought the earlier cat showed the other cat around the house so I really really didn't think it would give birth in my house. Also once I found the other cat in the kitchen even though the door was closed so it would have came from the exhaust fan area and there is no exhaust fan.

So I think the baby died from lack of milk but when I found it was injured and bleed so the other cat must have chewed it in frustration. I couldn't notice the sexes but they must have been parents. I also didn't think it was mating season. 

Also I used think people exaggerate of puking when they see disgusting stuff but when I was picking up the dead I actually puked. 

I actually am an animal lover and feed stray dogs and cats whenever I can. I would have felt happy when I would have found out they gave birth in my house. I am grateful that it was only one kitten. I really should have been careful and now I really sad and disgusted by my act. It all started of me being pissed at them waking me up in the morning which I shouldn't have done and thought out what was happening.

Guys be careful with animals. Make sure not to feel them too easy in your home if you can't handle the newborns in your home. I guess its mating season now so be prepared for them and care for them.

My parents go through my phone, social media and chats. I'm not allowed to talk to my friends on the phone and even if sometimes it urgent, they overhear every conversation. Even they'll tell me to sit and talk on the phone infront of every family members. I'm not allowed to go anywhere except for college. When it comes to clothing and lifestyle, every single decision is taken by them. I'm not allowed to do anything apart from studies, for which I have to give upon my interest in EDM music production and Guitar and Painting. My opinion doesn't matter, everytime I try to do something, I'm mocked by my parents for being a failure. 
NO, MOM and DAD! I wasn't born FAILURE. You made me fail, this miserable and sick life made me fail, your constant mockery of me infront of every other members made me a failure.

Today evening I walking back from my evening workout, in Bangalore. It was aroun 9.50pm and the routine so called ""traffic police checking"" was happening around the corner. 
I paused and went closer, because I was not driving and I can't be threatened by the police. Just in front of me a poor guy, driving a rusted discover 125cc was stopped by the constable. 
The rider with confidence, asked why are you stopping me, what is the law that I broke, the constable with zero conviction asked to park the bike by side and snatched the key from the bike. 
The guy kept questioning him what his mistake was. I also (rather unusually) joined him and asked the cop, that the man is right. Seeing that he was creating a scene other cops joined, they left their other victims (there were a dozen or so) and focussed on this guy. The 3rd cop came up with a reason, his back number plate font was not correct. 
By this time the guy started saying he will capture this on video for which the cop said go ahead. While he was doing that, other cop snatched his phone and said this was illegal. While he pleaded and fought to get his phone back the 3 cops asked to come to the station as he illegally captured the video. 
I started to protest, they tried telling me to go away, saying it is night and I have no business there. I stood my ground. The cop tried to snatch my phone, I didnt want to give him a chance hence didn't want to record from my phone.
The victim guy when he got a chance took my phone and tried calling 100 and his wife ( didn't notice). Eventually the guy was dragged on the road to a nearby police station. As I followed one cop stood back and initially tried to threaten me and then realized he didn't have leverage, and so started reasoning saying that he illegally recorded the video, he didn't have papers either etc. I told the cop he should be ashamed of himself, and please leave that poor man alone. Cop assured he will let him go and asked me to leave. I didn't know what else to do, so I left.
I found the victims details from his bike number and found his linkedin profile and messaged him saying if you need a witness I can come and give my statement.
I reached home, thinking of taking my friends, and going to the station. By that time his wife called ( he'd called her from my phone). I explained to her the situation, and told her I can come to the station. Then another male relative of his called and after hearing the situation he went and settled the issue in station.
At the station they filed petty case on him for obstructing duty (186) and made him pay 400. The petrified guy paid up and left.

What can we do as citizens to avoid this.
There were at least a dozen folks captured by the cops, instead of backing this guy who raised the voice, they all left taking the opportunity. I was trying to back this guy, I didn't get any support.
There were no SI or challan book, it was just constables. They dragged him to a station without a valid case. They even asked him for his passport and said they thought he was an illegal immigrant.

I am not able to sleep. I feel disgusted as a citizen and at our system. I don't know how differently I could have acted. I tried to search on Google for citizen lawyers but it didn't yield any results. I tried to insert myself into the situation, but maybe failed miserably.

Update: can someone share links/contact info of citizen lawyers who will be helping out in such situations. Just a phone number maybe, the biggest strength of these cops are our ignorance. If they know we know the law, they'll leave us alone 

Update 2: I had tweeted about this from the spot to police handle. If someone want to add some weight there.

This isn't 1998. We have tons of games now, on every platform. People play games. A small minority of those cause issues. What do we do? We blame the game.

I can't help but facepalm while reading media articles about this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;People are turning violent by playing PUBG, children are not focusing on studies.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But it has also created a lot of problems among the youth

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As per the notice, this was done due to the increase in violent behaviour by children and youth which was suspect to be a result of playing the game. 

&amp;#x200B;

If children are affected by the game, that just goes to show the carelessness of the parents. You don't need the government to control your kids. That's what parents are for.

If your child is being negatively influenced by something, you don't tell the government to ban it, unless it is a totally negative thing, which gaming isn't.

Kids used to go out and play Cricket with their friends in the 1970s. I'm pretty darn sure that there were similar cases with kids just playing outside all day and not studying. That does not mean that you would ban outside play.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Some 570 km away from Mumbai, the two young men were knocked down by the Hyderabad-Ajmer train, while they were engrossed in playing the game and did not give adequate attention to where they were going.

&amp;#x200B;

How is that an argument against the game? You're just showing the developers of PUBG how stupid your citizens are. That's the impression that they get.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In a recent report, a 15-year-old boy has been reportedly missing since March 11 who, according to the father, he is a great PUBG player and has been brainwashed by teammates to leave his home.

&amp;#x200B;

Congratulations, your spawn is braindead. Please don't reproduce again.

Okay that was a bit too harsh, but if that's what really happened, then it's unfortunate that the kid had bad influence and that he wasn't as sharp. That doesn't mean that the game deserves to be banned though.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just that out of all the PUBG players, it's only a really small minority that might be causing issues. What about the MAJORITY of its player base that just wants to enjoy the fucking game?

And it's not just PUBG. This can literally happen with any other game. While gaming in general is a positive thing to exist, it can have a negative effect on some individuals. Like anything else, be it TV, cricket, or social media. You name it.

So do we just start banning every game? Do we ban social media now as well? Heck, why don't we become China and censor the whole fucking internet?

So this particularly applies in India since you can buy once cigarette at a time instead of a pack.

I used to smoke about 6-8 cigs a day, and work out maybe twice a week halfheartedly. The new sense of motivation that I began using is as follows:

**Reward yourself with *one* cigarette after your workout. Plan to not buy cigarette packs and plan your day so you sort of look forward to that one cigarette after you work out**

Now this may seem strange(especially to people who do not smoke), and if you don't smoke, then that's great! But for those who do, this is especially helpful,

* I don't feel the need to have a cigarette when I'm stressed because I know that I would earn one once I work out later in the day.

* If I skip working out, well tough for me. I don't deserve a smoke today.

* If I'm overly exhausted and want a cigarette, well, I need to work out to deserve one. 

This is almost entirely placebo, and it works very well for me. It might work for someone else too. I went from 6-8 cigarettes a day to 3-4 when I first began this ""routine"" and then to 2 cigarettes and I'm very very proud to say that today was the first day after two months that I came back home without wanting to smoke. It feels great to be bringing myself to actually do this.

____________

**Some tips:**

* Don't smoke before your workout. If you work in the day, it would tire you out very quickly. If you are unable to control and do smoke, have a chewing gum afterwards or some form of mild sugar to ease up the nicotine levels.

* If you're taking pre-workout/caffeine/creatine/modafinil, it doesn't affect you too badly. Just again, try to not smoke before the workout. When I've done both, I've had a mad urge to poop before working out.

* Dehydration and heat loss: Its possible to be dehydrated right after you take a smoke so keep that into account and don't overexert especially in the beginning. If you just finished a workout and are going from a warm gym to a cool sky after, make sure you're well clothed because the nicotine can fuck you up if you're not well covered.

**Take nothing that I say, or anyone says as a given** I'm not a medical professional, and I am not trained to give out advice. This is what worked for me. I hope you're able to give up smoking and/or get that workout yourself too!",,b2khff,,0,,false,1560225417,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b2khff/lpt_if_you_are_a_smoker_and_wish_to_go_work_out/,,,false,Non-Political,

Moved so wanted to change my home branch. Tried doing it online, but it doesn't work. Some shit about how my account is not a 'Single Operative Account'. No online documentation about what this issue is and why it arises. Never mind, didn't expect SBI to take the effort to provide any meaningful info online anyway, they're probably still jerking their *too-big-to-fail* dicks for figuring out a way to make their shitty as fuck website work on browsers apart from Internet Explorer. So I show up at the branch I wanna shift my account to, fill out a form and attach ID proof and everything. Dude at the desk takes like 25 minutes to make a fucking copy, and tells me to hand it over to another guy sitting across the room. Guy across the room tells me he'll post the thing to my old branch, probably via carrier pigeon because fuck living in 2019 you middle-aged WhatsApp-addicted cunts but anyway, guy tells me to come back if it's not done within a week. I give him 10 days, but of course nothing happens. Go back to the branch thrice over a week, shuffle around 2 counters, get some inane meaningless drivel that I can't even remember whose gist is 'Fuck you, go suck a dick and get fucking herpes and super gonorrhea'. Finally, after 4 fucking visits, they tell me my account has been transferred, even though my netbanking account still shows my old branch as my home branch. Visit again to tell them that, dude at the desk clacks some keys and tells me that it's done and updated online, but then of course this is SBI and it would be uncharacteristic to expect them to wipe their own incompetent asses in under 24 hours so of course the lady sitting beside the dude at the desk tells me it can take 24 hours for the change to be updated online. Whatever, I give them a week and surprise surprise, my netbanking account *still* shows my old branch as my home branch. 

&amp;#x200B;

By this point, I don't give a fuck, if they say my account has been successfully transferred, I'll just play along. So gotta re-do my KYC, and I apply for a new chequebook as well. 3 weeks go by, my chequebook still isn't here. In the meantime, I also order a debit card cause I wanted to try out Netflix and buy shit via Paypal. Debit card arrives within a week, and I'm excited as fuck cause man I just want to checkout indie films on Netflix. Proceed to signup on Netflix, try adding the card and boom, **THE MOTHERFUCKING CUNT OF A CARD SENDS ITS VERIFICATION OTP TO SOMEONE OLD-ASS NUMBER I HAD LITERALLY 7 YEARS AGO**. I've had that number updated 6 years ago, and been getting netbanking OTPs normally on my new number ever since, but gee thanks for coming up with innovative ways to fuck with me SBI. Go back to branch again, they have no clue about how to deal with it. Oh and get a load of this, the reason I didn't receive my chequebook is because these dumb-as-fuck pricks sent it to an old address I lived at fucking 7 years ago, and have updated twice since, including the motherfucking KYC like 3 weeks ago. I have to wonder, do SBI guys like go on corporate retreats to the Mountain of Incompetent Faggotry where they sit around a campfire and come up with ways to pull shit like this?

&amp;#x200B;

So I collect my chequebook, and of course the fun doesn't stop because there's a 'Minor' next to my name on each leaf, despite the fact that I came of age more than half-a-fucking-decade ago. Betichod your website has a billion sections for everything from your shitty schemes to fucking high-resolution pics of Sasquatch's asshole and you can't add one fucking section that has a '*Hey assholes you have my DoB can't you tell I'm not a kid anymore*' button? I tell them I've fucking had it with their shit and I'm closing my account, at which point they're all '*No hey cmon we've got you covered we can fix all this*'. So they get me to write down the problems I have on a page and pinkie-swear that they'll fix it all in a week. I pick up an account closing form anyway. 10 days later, they have apparently updated my netbanking account to reflect my changed home branch, so hey good on them only took them a fucking month. My debit card is still about as useful as nipples on a breastplate cause I can't get it fucking verified. I drop by the branch again, they tell me it's an issue and they'll be sending an email to *who-fucking-knows-or-cares*, and they'll notify me when they fix things, which is probably fucking never. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't even gone into detail with the shitshow that is trying to change the mobile number associated with your account online. There's some retarded fuckery that involves sending OTPs from both your old and new number, with fuckall response about the status of your request. I waited for a fucking week before receiving no response via phone or email and just tried to get it changed via my branch, which took two visits even though all those lazy cunts had to do was note down a fucking reference number I gave them. 

&amp;#x200B;

This bank is such a fucking joke. I'm so done with it, I'm moving to someplace like HDFC or ICICI where shit works and I don't have to visit the fucking branch to the smallest fucking job done.

Third time in 3 consecutive years, I have been  posting on /r/India about the failures in life.... life has become stagnant without social exposure, formal education and the stigma of being mentally ill doesn't make it any easier. 

I'm an average guy who grew up in a small Indian town who used to be one of those  front benchers (is that the opposite of backbenchers? ). I had to deal with mocking/mild-bullying from my peers which got my nerves, ... I was socially awkward, non-conformist ( being edgy and liking things before they hit mainstream culture but not really being committed to them... so basically no depth...and battling identity crisis)... Anyhow,  things weren't too bad back then.. even though I always longed for attention from people, I got my ""homework"" done in time... but after some problems in family, things got worse. Life kept going downhill...and I dropped out of school. For the past 8 years I have been living on the internet, doing basically nothing... and while I try to  make an effort to change things, the snickering neighbors, the relatives and the old schoolmates ... I feel insecure to them and sometimes ( most of the time) they make life way worse than it already is. 

As of 2019, I am diagnosed with ASD  so I should be AspieSenpai rather than SchizoSenpai but... does it really change the fact that I am a misfit, neurodivergent ...nerd? Where do I fit in this country that looks down upon people like us? ... do I just go out and find my people ...but how? Should I just do it? ( Do what? ... with numerous quirks, obsessions and awkwardness it's so hard to get anything done ) ... getting advice from people that are /r/wowthanksimcured material. 

Resolutions for changing my life, start with taking ""small steps"" and end up with an attempt to learn everything in very small period of time ( even when I find it really hard to stay concentrated on what I am reading.. )... I understand that it's possible to do amazing things on the internet... *magar ye dimaag mane tab na*? 

Not asking for help to change my life overnight, but constructive advice and criticism is always appreciated. Thanks for reading and have a comfy sleep fellow /r/Indian~

2. Did anyone else's parents leave them alone at home, very suspiciously hinting at an orgy, JUST for passing Class XII?
3. Kareena Kapoor looks more beautiful than ever and she's giving me serious hope for my 30s which aren't as far away now as they were right out of college. 
4. I do not know if I can live through this. SO MUCH CRINGE. 
5. WTF is this father-in-law creepily checking out his son's fiance passing out comments TO HIS SON.
6. Why do Indians eat with fork/knife at home?
7. Who is afraid to admit they stalk someone online before meeting them anymore? 
8. This is a very weird mix of American and Indian. 
9. I like them showing that however modern and rich families are, they don't let go of their superstitious beliefs. 
10. Ok as long as that kid isn't involved in an unnecessary disaster-plot, I'm glad they're showing the mom bringing her kid along to her friend's wedding.
11. Aunties talking about kids at the wedding - not even a joke.
12. Am I really high or do some of these characters not feel even a bit exaggerated like the TDC hitting on Sonam Kapoor's character?
13. That Aussie dude traumatized by the horrendous dress is the best actor in this movie. 
14. WTF why did she end up with the creep?
15. How is her kid so well behaved even with so much happening around him?! 
16. I like the relationship between the couple to be married. I keep forgetting their names.
17. Why has that creep not been kicked in the nuts yet?
18. I LOVE the husband taking care of the kid while the mom gets drunk at her best friend's wedding. 
19. SHE DID NOT JUST SLEEP WITH THE CREEP.
20. I really like Kareena Kapoor in this movie. 
21. Big fan of Sumeet Vyas, and I hope he works in loads of movies. And more plays.
22. This movie is a big warning about wedding costs.
23. They decided to blur the vibrator in the movie, but a big purple blob on a white bedsheet isn't a very good disguise. 
24. This movie is actually about money. They've shown credit cards being swiped twice in five minutes now, punctuated by a dialogue about money.
25. I know now that I need to eat Amul ice cream, fly Air India, use Uber, and furnish my house from Gulmohar Lane furniture. And vacation in Phuket obviously. This movie doesn't only talk about money, also tells you how to use it.
26. The white guy is a really good husband. 
27. As an Indian woman not having too many feel good female buddy movies in Bollywood, I actually enjoyed this movie. Perfect use of my romcom movie day. This is what I want from a romcom - no brains, feel all cute and warm. The female characters are actually better than those in half of Hollywood's romcoms. 
28. I just heard the best and the worst line ever - 'dieting pe hai toh kyun khati bhav'. Hmm. I hope no guy ever uses that on me.

No doubt, as an approximation of retribution for the almost 200 years long British Raj. Our people also don't shy away from the racist slurs we could imagine.

From creepy online predators (the friends of Mr Bob Vegana who like lasagna a lot) to scammers (IRS/Tech support just search on YouTube) we do have our fair share of weirdos.
PewDiePie and the whole world mostly knows us by our online avatar plus 'bollywood' (what a tragically pathetic name!) shenanigans. Which doesn't give an outside viewer the right idea of our nation.

Sure, PewDiePie is a troll (although he doesn't go all out nowadays unlike his alleged Nazi Sympathising jokes in the past) and our brothers and sisters simply took the bait resulting into a unity that the nation has seen on rare occasions. What does it result into? Chunks of profit to all parties involved, PewDiePie, T-Series and YouTube (the platform has seen more users engaged and hence monetisation heaven.)

There is a silver lining to this. If you consider the massive support both parties have been able to garner, we could (in theory) use that level of international syndication to our advantage. Imagine such a large force of driven people striving to spread awareness about important issues. Cancer, science literacy, international human rights threats, or (my favourite) coming up with a better system of governance by which we may improve our lives along with ensuring that the future survives.

I'll be giving JEE and BITSAT among a few other exams, but I've been wondering if I should also be trying for foreign universities. I'm interested in computer science engineering. My questions are;

1) What countries are the most affordable and appropriate for an engineering undergraduate degree? Are there any scholarships I should know of?

2)I'm interested in some East Asian countries such as Japan, Singapore and Korea, are their universities hard to get into for an Indian student like me? More so, is a degree there worth the effort? I absolutely love the vibe those countries give off(I've only visited Singapore though and I can honestly say I fell in love with it, more than I ever have with any other country I've ever seen), but obviously appearances aren't all that matter: is it actually easy to live there as an Indian student? Are the scholarships any good?

&amp;#x200B;

3)Should I give more priority to Indian universities or foreign universities? I'm definitely not gonna get into an IIT, but a top NIT can (possibly...?) be expected.

4) An extension of q1, What are the easiest top foreign universities to get into? USA is probably not an option btw because the fees are way too high

* The cinematography is very unique 
* It's a musical, but the lyrics do not appear too forced upon, in fact I would appreciate the lyricists job too

I think we can take inspiration from Israel and conduct compulsory military training for the younger generation. Being ready in the face of danger is critical for situations like terrorist attacks or gang-rapes. It can also inspire a sense of respect for our army men/women.

No defence is as swift as self-defence. 

Edit: I get it. Mandatory training for nearly 60 crore youth is a gargantuan financial burden. But what if the training was voluntary and on a payment basis. It may attract at least a few highly motivated young people. 

Edit2: It seems people got too triggered by my post. Well it was already a ""change my view"" post. So I was encouraging you to prove me wrong. There was no need to get so flustered.

So, Uber Pool Circus.  
Was on my way back home from an assignment. Called a pool. On my way my father called me up. got talking about certain things in my office. Considering certain people and their actions at the office, naturally I was extremely pissed. While talking to my father, I referred to a certain person as ""Fucking asshole"" (I wasn't yelling or even talking loudly). Now, there were two other co-passengers. One was a girl and another was a man in late 40s who got up at Gariahat. So here goes the man. (It takes a lot for me to refer to people in derogatory terms, but here we go). I'll be referring to the man as psycho, too. So, after I uttered the unforgivable ""Fucking asshole"".  
Psycho: Language.  
Me: (really pissed) Excuse me, did just say something?  
Psycho: (haughtily) I said, language.  
Me: How is it any of your business, sir? I don't even know you.  
Psycho: Listen, son, you're in a Pool. And it is illegal to abuse in a public space.  
Me: I'm sorry, did I abuse you. Why are you interfering with my personal conversation?  
Psycho: Listen, son, it is against the law to use abusive words in the public.   
Me: Oh, really? Why don't you tell me which law this is? Why don't you cite me the Article that deals with this law?

(For those concerned about my lack of knowledge,I know about Section 294 and how it works, thank you)

Psycho: I don't know the Article but I can call up my department and they will tell you about it.  
Me: Please, call them up and then talk to me.  
Psycho: (really angry) I realize you may be dealing with problems...  
Me: I am dealing with problems, and for some reason a complete stranger is butting into my conversation.  
Psycho: See, son...  
Me: Please, don't call me ""son"".  
Psycho: I am much older than you and you cannot use abusive language in public.  
Me: Did I abuse you? Am I preaching around in public? Or have I put up any hoarding with abusive content on it?  
Psycho: But this is a public space. You cannot use abusive language in public.

(I know, it's getting repetitive. At least, you get the idea how i felt ��;) )

Psycho: You're much younger than me with much less understanding about how you should conduct yourself... (I'll spare you the rest. That was a long drawn out speech and you know how these things go).  
Me: Yup, you're a psycho.   
Psycho: (laughs) I don't know who you are...  
Me: That's what I'm saying.  
Psycho: ...but I can tell this much from your attitude, you won't achieve much in your future.   
Me: Really? I have no idea who you are, you butt into my conversation, you start moral policing me out of nowhere, you cite a law you can't even provide further information about and now you, a complete stranger, comment on my future.   
Psycho: I really have doubts about the kind of education you received.  
Me: I think your education neglected to teach you to respect other's privacy.  
Psycho: I don't know which school you're from, dada. (From ""son"" to ""dada"". ��O.o )  
Me: ( we were crossing JU) You just crossed it. (I don't think he heard me, otherwise the conversation would've spiraled down a really predictable route)   
Me: (finally) Fucking ridiculous, man.  
Psycho: (somehow calling him a ""psycho"" didn't matter, but this term made go off the hook) (barking like crazy) Did you just abuse me? Did you? No, no, you tell me, tell me, tell me did you just say anything to me? (The rambling went on)  
Me: If you could just shut up for a second, I would tell you that I called you ""fucking ridiculous"".   
Psycho: That's it! (To the driver) Take this car to the police station right now!  
Me: Let's go.  
Driver: (poor guy) But...  
Psycho: No, no! Take it to the police station right now!  
Girl (the other co-passenger): Excuse me, but need to go to my location. I'm in a hurry.  
Psycho: No, ma'am...  
Girl: No, no. I need to meet up with my mother.  
Psycho: Tell me, ma'am, did I say anything wrong.  
Girl: See, I would say that using that kind of language in public is wrong.  
Me: See, if he had said that he was uncomfortable, I would have understood. But he butts into my conversation and starts lecturing how it is illegal.  
Psycho: I simply requested you to stop using that kind of language.  
Me: Wow, is that how you request somebody?  
Psycho: I did request you. I said ""language"".  
Me: ��-\_-  
Me: Maybe your education also neglected how to request something from anybody.

Unfortunately, I had to get off first so I missed any further drama that would be possible. But anyway, if you're somehow reading this, here I am, asshole. I gave you a lot more to whine about, too. Also. you're an egoistical maniac.

Edit: Interestingly, I see that almost all of the people calling me out for cussing have no problems doing it extremely well themselves.

I don’t like staring at a screen for hours reading ant like letters from a pirated .PDF or EPUB which might have enough mistakes and omissions to ruin the whole experience of reading a story or a novel. 

I like physical books and I like collecting them. I find the feel and the touch of it helping to the experience of reading a book apart from the fact that it seems a very personal object after I am done reading. 

Although I can’t bear the price of books. The recent Yuval Noah Harrari book costs ₹950 on Amazon. I literally collect money to buy books and god forbid if I need to buy a series because if you buy them separately you will end up with six different sizes and page colours. 

Not to mention the absolute unavailability of some titles and classics. This is true about even the local literature and not just the English ones pressed foremost in Western or European countries.

Me and a friend of mine came to a conclusion that in order to do so, maybe we need to develop a larger circle of learners, that we can compete against, and make notes with.

Employees in India have no respect for their employers and their procedures and often put the company in a pickle by being absolutely selfish. &amp; this in turn contributes to worse working conditions for the few decent employees that exist.

&amp;#x200B;

First is the question of the notice period when resigning. The notice period exists so the employer can arrange for a replacement to continue doing your job and projects aren't adversely affected. In cases of site projects, having less than the required number of employees at a site can incur penalties from the project owner. But employees think of this as ""Company holding me against my will"".

People put in resignations and just walk out leaving the company short. This is why the trend of paying a months salary at the end of the next month exists in India.

Even worse are the people who do not resign at all and straight up disappear from their job without any intimation or those who do not return at all from their vacations. These are extremely shitty things to do and also why makes companies implement policies such as no leave allotment in the first year of employment. 

Bigger companies are able to handle these issues but these are body blows to small and medium scale companies. It's not a question of education since the examples I did provide are of engineers, it's a question of ethics.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there are issues are people using company time and resources to work on independent projects for side cash, even being dumb enough to use company email for said activities. I hope I don't need to explain why this is a problem and I wouldn't believe it was a problem if I hadn't seen it myself.

&amp;#x200B;

This and a lot more unethical shit is far too common in India and instead of fostering a good work environment, results in hostility between the employee and an employer and the employer taking action to protect themselves from this harm results in worse conditions for all employees.

I am feeling so angry. This was an important story that needed to be told with honesty, integrity and dignity. He made a joke out of it. 

The story, script, screenplay, acting, cinematography and direction were all cringy.

Why was the focus all on the DCP? I strongly feel he was biased about her and had conflicts of interest.

Whys everyone else shown in bad light. I know that police officers are often useless, but it showed them in really poor light. 

What is even worse is that he is getting praise and recognition for this sorry excuse of a series.

What was this story about?

Bravery of DCP? Burnout in Delhi police? How the vegetarian Delhi police officers are forced to eat chicken? How retarded they are that they take all criminals by holding there hands instead of handcuffs? WTF?

This incident deserved more attention and care than a high school movie project.

Ritchie if you're reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself.

I've noticed this and it pains me to see people living away from families just for earning money and due to lack of opportunities in their towns. This is a problem at an individual level. The ramifications of this at a national level is more unhappy people , traffic congestion, too many ugly low budget buildings to accommodate more people, crowded streets and footpaths etc. This situation persists inspite of presence of good colleges in towns.",,axow8o,,0,,false,1560137279,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/axow8o/improving_towns_to_save_our_cities_and_mental/,,,false,Non-Political,

Can we collectively form a couple of questions for him and ask him about it next time he does the AMA. It was over before most of India woke up and even then there was much bigger news to distract us :P

I changed my SMS center number to 1234 as they suggested but even after the change I've received just as many OTP messages as the number of times a virgin has had sex.

[Bangalore Traffic due to Road Design](https://i.redd.it/8h85mlxiwpj21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

 This is a case-study and practical insights on the causes of traffic congestion experienced on the Outer Ring Road – in particular, the stretch (and direction) starting from Mahadevapura till Marathahalli, ORR. While traffic congestion is everywhere in Bangalore, in general, the aim of this document is to show-case this particular stretch as glaring example of various reasons and faults that lead to congestion and hopefully serve as example of things can be readily improved as well as certain designs that need to go away for good.

However, my landlord is not giving me his PAN details. He outright refused to give me and he probably isn't reporting this income to IT. What to do? 

---

some math: 

I come in 30% income bracket. My monthly basic is 80,000 and my HRA is 40,000. My rent is 25,000. I used this calculator - https://cleartax.in/paytax/hracalculator

According to calculator, it says 17k is exempted and 23K is taxable. So, if my owner gives me his PAN, I would be paying ~6,900 (30% of 23k) as tax. Is that right? 

Now, since he isn't, I can get exemption upto 1L/year. In that case, I would be paying ~12,000 INR (30% of 40K) as tax. Is that right? 

So, since he is not giving me his pan, effectively I am losing 5100 INR (12000 - 6900) per month, as tax, which I could have avoided. Is that right? 

--- 

I also found some online links that I can still save on tax deductions and file for ITR even though I don't have PAN details: [ndtv](https://www.ndtv.com/business/landlord-not-giving-pan-how-to-claim-hra-tax-benefits-1734760), [ET](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/tax/how-to-claim-tax-exemption-on-hra-without-landlords-pan/articleshow/59574630.cms) how true is that?

The moment finally arrived and I chose the payment by eWallet option and this is what it displayed. Your balance - 4500, ticket costs - 4200-ish. Balance INSUFFICIENT. Wtf
So after I used another payment method thinking to my clever self that I'll conveniently transfer back the unused wallet amount to my bank account only to find out that there isn't any option to do so! Moreover, you cannot use the wallet money for literally anything else but booking tickets.

&amp;nbsp;


If you've been using any music streaming service in the past few years- be it a website, the radio or music channels, you may have noticed that at least in the metros, there has been an increasing number of Punjabi songs being played.
Infact, my SoundCloud's Top 50 Charts is dominated by Punjabi singers with the exception of the odd Hindi Bollywood song, some English and a couple Korean.

&amp;nbsp;

A lot of this could be traced back to the explosion of Yo Yo Honey Singh in Bollywood earlier this decade. Following Honey Singh, in Bollywood itself, we've seen party music shift from Hinglish to something more Haryanvi (a mixture of Punjabi and Hindi, largely spoken in and around Delhi) and English. Leading this charge is Baadshah and Guru Randhawa, and both of them have had many bangers in the past 4-5 years.

Besides these two, we've had Diljeet Dosanjh, Jasmine Sandlas, Harrdy Sandhu and this year, Jass Manak, Mankirat Aulakh and many more.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm linking a couple of my favourite songs from this boom below:

1547222315,india,Saga199019,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aewqm7/i_need_your_help/,9,2,,,I need your help,"The title explicitly mentions that I'm in need of guidance. I'm in my early 20s studying at a decent Indian university. It wouldn't be wrong to say that I'll be able to secure a job that pays a decent salary on graduating. I shall forever be grateful to my parents for the role they've played in making me the person I am.

Despite having a fairly comfortable middle class lifestyle I don't feel happy. My life seems barren, fruitless to me. The unvarying nature of my life gnaws at me. I met a doctor. I'm not clinically depressed.
 
I used to have a lot of friends. However most of them now are romantically involved and aren't able to spend a lot of time with me. Those having fulfilling relationships state that their love is what provides meaning to their lives.

I desperately need a direction in life. The lack of an aim, purpose is frightening.

Help a fellow youngster.

1553715741,india,PlasticFig,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b68q2i/finally_visited_india_after_24_years/,15,2,,,Finally visited India after 24 years...,"Hi guys, so about a month ago I visited the motherland (India) and hadn't been there for a loong time. Not being from India I had heard stories about how poor it was &amp; not a good place to visit. However I was pleasantly surprised at the changes &amp; would like to share them with you! 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Family 

This is probably the biggest. Family means so much in Indian culture &amp; everyone takes care of one another. I really felt this when my extended family showed up &amp; accepted me into the fold even though I hadn't met them before. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Trans Community

The Trans community (Hijra) are widely accepted and revered and it's considered lucky if they visit your house, unlike the US where trans rights are still being debated because of religious influence. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Customer Service &amp; Hospitality

This is #1 here- when you go to a shop you're treated like family, same with being a guest at someone's house. Treating people for business or pleasure is a part of life here &amp; going the extra mile is expected. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Friendliness &amp; Helpfulness of People

You're not scared of asking people for directions or anything-strangers will come up to you &amp; ask you if you need help. I've seen instances of people rolling down windows &amp; helping each other out in the middle of traffic. Very different from the US where people tend to live in their own bubble.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Women &amp; Femininity 

Femininity is a big thing here- women dress up from head to toe in gold, makeup, nail polish, the works. Fashion is a huge industry here. Women can dress up however much they want and it's respected as part of their femininity. They wouldn't take well to being told what to wear. You feel lazy in your sweatpants &amp; shirt with how much pride women take in dressing up lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

6. Weirdly Progressive Ideas &amp; Creativity

There's deaf only cafes (Mirchi &amp; Mime), eating in complete darkness (Taste of Darkness), &amp; eating in jail (Kaldi Kitchen). Indians are bold &amp; ready to try new ideas...definitely unique from the US. Advertising is also super innovative. 

&amp;#x200B;

7. How Much Education Is Valued

Everyone over there is encouraged to aim high. There's a picture of a woman living inside a pipe sending her daughter to school. Kids dream high and parents support it. Knowledge is valued so much so that if you step on a piece of paper it's a sin. 

&amp;#x200B;

8. Parents' Help 

Parents help their kids until they know their kids are going to be ok. From getting a job to getting married, parents are always there if you need help. This is good for people who are introverts or do need more help in figuring shit out. 

&amp;#x200B;

9. Vegetarianism

India has the highest vegetarian population in the world and it's because of a concept called ahimsa (non-violence). Indian food has evolved to be tasty because of spices so meat isn't missed! Some states have only vegetarian restaurants- great for the environment.

&amp;#x200B;

10. Yoga &amp; Meditation

Spirituality is a huge part of India's culture and yoga has helped out so many. Meditation, breathing exercises, and taking care of mental/spiritual health all originate from this culture. 

&amp;#x200B;

11. Integrity &amp; Values

Most homeless people have something to sell in India. They also don't accept money just for free. Even a child will have something to give you in exchange for money whether it be balloons or pencils. Self respect is important to these people &amp; they truly are self made.  

&amp;#x200B;

12. Hustle &amp; Hard Work

Everyone, no matter their situation is always working hard &amp; persisting. I've seen people sleeping in the middle of highways. It's truly remarkable how much the human spirit can endure &amp; do. I'm sure not everyone there is happy with their situation but they bear it and try to be happy with life. Most of all, they try to help people even if they have a little bit. They see as natural, not as a ""kind"" thing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

13. Languages &amp; Diversity 

Soo many languages! There are 22 major languages in India, and people from the north look completely different than people from the south (different DNA). There is a black Indian population (siddis) as well as an Northeast Indian population that looks asian. 

&amp;#x200B;

14. ISRO 

The space program was known for sending India to the moon on a budget cheaper than the movie Interstellar. 

&amp;#x200B;

15. Homosexuality 

Homosexuality was actually accepted in ancient India as seen by the Ajanta caves but British puritanical ideas labelled that savage. Fortunately they're reverting back to what they believed before with the Supreme Court ruling.  

&amp;#x200B;

16. Religion 

Religion is extremely important in India &amp; there are 8! religions. Jains cover their mouth so they don't kill microbes. Sikhs are bound by honor to help people in need. 

&amp;#x200B;

17. Alcohol-Free

Some states in India are still alcohol free- so no one in my family has ever tried alcohol. Alcohol isn't bad, but you learn that it's still possible to have a full life without it, unlike in the US where it permeates every aspect. 

&amp;#x200B;

19. Technology

With apps like Swiggy &amp; Zomato food delivery is made super easy. Dabbawalas or food deliverers do this without technology, achieving a six sigma level of efficiency in a population of 18 million (Mumbai).

&amp;#x200B;

20. Food/Dress

Obviously, can't leave out the amazing food &amp; clothing that most people think of when they think of India. 

&amp;#x200B;

21. Bollywood

There truly are meaningful movies &amp; topics in Bollywood that I haven't seen in Hollywood. Stories about disability (Hitchki, Paa, Taare Zameen Par) to female inspiration movies (Raazi, Neerja, Dangal) &amp; controversial movies (My Name is Khan), Bollywood isn't afraid to tackle sensitive areas. 

&amp;#x200B;

22. Maid Service

Greatest part of living there is cheap maid service. Can hire someone to do your laundry, cook, clean whereas in the US it's super expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

23. Cheap Healthcare! 

Doctor's visits cost $10. There is a cap on knee implants/stents which has made Trump angry. Free healthcare will be available for India's poorest, soon.

&amp;#x200B;

24. Largest Democracy

With the new identity card (PAN card), India's poorest can have access to voting, banking, etc. A feat for over a billion people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, there's still cons to this country (trash problems, unemployment, religious tensions, gender roles, status concerns) but things are improving slowly &amp; some things are unique to India and not seen in Western countries. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately the mentality there is that everything western is good while Indian is bad. I've met people who think speaking in English is better than speaking in their own language (because English means you're smarter?), to thinking that McDonalds is better than authentic street food just because it's from the US.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, being modern?? means that you speak in English, wear western clothes, cuss at every other word, drink, smoke, do drugs &amp; are suuper sexual (See Youtube videos- Mumbai on pubes, orgasm, cleavage). 

&amp;#x200B;

It's like...chill out. India as a whole seems to have this apologetic tone to it at best- especially the more urban &amp; ""modern"" population that they're not like the US. 

&amp;#x200B;

And at worst...well just see pictures of Ed Sheeran get mobbed by young Bollywood.

I needed some money to buy some stuffs which i liked on the internet, cant ask my parents for money they are in a really bad situation and cant spare any money for such stuffs.

So what i did was really shitty, created a Instagram account and put on my bio that i sell Netflix, Spotify etc premiumaccounts at low prices. Uploaded some screenshots of Netflix and boom !! Lots of dms for accounts, most of them were asking for free but some of them wanted to buy these accounts. I sold like 8-9 account and got myself a 2500 in just a week. I never expected that. Bought someone a gift,it was the main purpose of this. Its for valentine's week. She wouldn't mind if i didnt gift her one, she is cool with my situation. Bought myself some stuffs with the extra money. Fuck my ego !

Now the worst part. 2 days after it and i am drowning in guilt, i cant sleep, cant eat food, gets angry easily and here is the worstest part my one parcel hsnt arrived and another one got damaged stuffs, got angry on my friend and she left me, my girl blocked me for no reason, was about to hit a car and such shits are happening after i did that. Is it karma? Did i messed up my life? What should i do. 

Edit:The accounts not gonna last for a year as i said its gonna get blocked by Netflix in  a week or so, they paid nearly 400 for one.

I'd prefer good point conversion ratio over anything else as it gives me the freedom to spend over anything I want. Trying googling but most sites are full of paid reviews of cards I know for a fact are not that good. I spend 20-25k per month on my cc (all expenses except rent). Reviews of cards I've used so far:

1) HDFC regalia first: 4 points (=1 re) on 150 rs. Hassle free services and no fake transactions or anything plus free lounge access (visa). Plus flat discount on Amazon sales

2) SBI irctc: good point conversion ratio and service charge on tickets are waived off but points are pretty useless since you can only use them for 2nd tier ac tickets and I haven't been able to link my loyalty account thanks to the shitty support service

3) HSBC: got sold by the 1+1 movie ticket offer only to realize later that the discount is limited to rs 200 plus they login system is the worst I've ever seen

4) citi platinum: good points but not many offers on shopping/dining compared to hdfc cards

I have the HDFC infinia on offer but that's too costly for my needs (10k annual fee waived off only after 8 lakh worth of spends). How about amex gold, hdfc diners card? (I don't fly that often so not looking for miles cards)

I recently got placed in  one of the major private company in India say X. We have a placement officer who is incharge of calling companies and arranging tests and interviews. So thing that happened is we got a screenshot of a message from the placement office on 7 th December that we have to go for an medical checkup on 27 th November from college( they sent us a screenshot of email) . We asked them what medical checkup all about and the date has passed  so what necessary action should be taken to which we were told that no action need to be taken. I asked the placement officer to get some information about the scene he replied that companies have time frame and will send the placement letters accordingly. Now yesterday I got a call from my parents that the X company called and told that they will cancel our candidature if we didn't have respond. I responded immediately to them. Now that type of situation has occurred with students who got placed in a music app company. That they got mail to confirm their job with the company after the date to confirm has passed. Another incident was one student got confirmation from college that he got placed in some company. Now due to the rule that if you got placed in one company we are not allowed to sit in other companies. He didn't sit in any of the companies. He gave party and sort of things and he was later told that he was not hired but some other student was hired. He missed about 5-6 major companies and I can tell you he is one of the top coder of the college. Similarly another guy was told that he has been hired at management position in one company but was later told it was same day that he was not. We tried complaining about him to higher authorities like Prof. incharge of placements that the placement officer is incapable of doing his job seriously and there have been chances that some thing bad may happen due to him. 
I wanted to ask if there is some official way to approach this situation.
TL:DR; Incapable Placement Officer in IIT.  Prof incharge of placement is not listening to us.

1549384283,india,ripple_guy,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/anfsvi/phenotype_and_not_skin_color_is_the_reason_why/,42,3,,,Phenotype and not skin color is the reason why dark skinned women don't get much roles in Bollywood,"This post is a response to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/an2n9x/when_will_darkskinned_indian_women_ever_play_the/) post made by u/KLBikey earlier today. They said that dark skinned Tamilian women don't get roles in Bollywood etc. Instead light skinned North Indians get them.

My point is that skin color matters but that isn't the core reason why dark skinned Dravidian women don't get many roles in Bollywood or other movies. The deeper problem is the phenotype. Do you think that Whites are considered better looking just because of their skin color? Let us lighten Lupita Nyong'o and apply a BW filter. Then I'll darken Cobie Smulders and apply BW again. [This](https://imgur.com/a/oQQV1T0) is the comparison.

Who do you think looks better? Another example. [Kiara Advani vs a White actress](https://imgur.com/a/MZfXOqV) I made Kiara's face darker. I can't say about others but Kiara looks way better than the White woman. Why? It is because skin color doesn't make you bad looking. It is your bone structure.

**Yes skin color is obviously a very important part and racism and bias does exist but if you are waiting for the day when women like Mindy Kaling, since she was mentioned in the other post, get roles in Bollywood then I have bad news for you. That day will never come.**

If you made Mindy Kaling as white as milk she would still look uglier than 99.9% White girls and 100% Bollywood actresses that ever played a role in a movie. Why? Because she isn't bad looking because she is dark. She is just ugly. Btw ladies and gents [this](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse3.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.oA1D8EWwWRmUukdJt1Pm2gHaIU%26pid%3D15.1&amp;f=1) is Mindy Kaling. Now let us compare her with Chitrangada Singh. [This](https://imgur.com/a/eFl1VAF) is the result. I would say ChitranGada looks slightly darker than Mindy. But she looks 10000 times better than her. The fat distribution, eyes, Facial proportions, Facial width to height ratio, hair, skin texture, nose especially the nasal bridge, eyebrows etc make Chitrangada a living goddess. 

**I am actually surprised that Hollywood casts such a woman in the name of being progressive. Is this really how Indian women look? I feel they just want to spread the stereotype that Indian women are ugly and look like that.**

Coming back to Bollywood, most women and even men who fit the Aryan/Caucasian phenotype despite being dusky get the roles. Women like Chitrangada Singh are hot despite not being white like Alia Bhatt. 
Priyanka Chopra is successful because she is attractive while some fairer skinned women are struggling.

Now coming to the brutal truth, if you are looking for extremely dark women, they almost always are from South India and have Dravidian phenotypes. Sorry but that phenotype isn't considered attractive by most people. Just like African phonetypes are not considered that attractive. **Now the question that we have been brainwashed to find Caucasian/Aryan phenotypes more attracive or whether it is because of other reasons is a topic in itself.** But it isn't just about skin color. It is about bones.",,anfsvi,,0,,false,1553019864,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/anfsvi/phenotype_and_not_skin_color_is_the_reason_why/,,,false,Non-Political,

Alt account obviously. Please let me know if this is not the right place to post this and should be posted elsewhere. Consider this hypothetical scenario:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I have $270K in 401K at age 44. I intend to return to India for good at 45 and become ordinary resident after RNOR.
2. I intend to leave the 401K account untouched until I turn 60 (or should I do a traditional IRA rollover?).
3. I earn about 5% returns, on paper, every year in the 401k/IRA account (for the next 15 years until I become eligible to withdraw without the 10% penalty). 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Reading on the internet, I understand that I will need to report the 5% paper gains on my Indian tax return each year. But does that mean I also pay the Indian authorities taxes on the paper-gain amount each year? Or its just      reporting but I don’t have to pay taxes on it? 
2. At age 60 when I begin taking distributions from 401K/IRA, I am sure I will pay taxes to IRS in US but what will be my tax liability in India? Will I be paying Indian income taxes at that time as well?
3. How does the DTAA even play into all this?

2. Parents don't pay for college education. While this is considered the bare minimum here and some people even can afford to fund their children's higher education, what is the idea behind the culture of kids leaving parents and surviving independently and taking up campus jobs to pay for their education? (Before anyone attacks me for talking from privileged bubble, I do recognize this but I still find middle class Indians saving up and considering child's college their duty)

3. Adults don't stay with parents. While I acknowledge the educative value of independence, still why is staying with parents frowned upon? Does this flow from the point I raised above?

MY friends!! Why do they gang up on me? Why do they bully me? Why do they tease me? What in God's name am I doing wrong?”, said a frustrated, 12 year old boy to himself; squinting his eyes in an attempt to save them from the sun shining directly at his face. It was the 80's. He was sitting on marine drive in late afternoon by himself, after getting home from school. It had been a regular day that involved his friends mocking him for his effeminate demeanor. Marine drive always accepted and caressed the little, wounded heart by letting him brood peacefully without anyone mocking him. The kid with squishy little eyes adorned by elaborately large pupils, a fat bunny nose, perfectly oiled and combed hair, clad with slightly spoiled school uniform got up dusting his hands off. He was done gazing at the waves of Arabian sea as they appeared and disappeared for god knows how long. He consoled himself and went back home with the power to face the upcoming day.

He was struggling to deal with everyone's remarks on his 'demeanor'. His own brother couldn't resist expressing his disappointment with little brother's odd behavior that made him butt of jokes in Wadi(colony). He however didn't observe the water surfaced in little's eyes watching his elder brother vent out frustration to their mother. How was a 12 year old baby supposed to fathom why was what came naturally to him so amusing to general public, why he was made to sit down by being called 'hijde'(a derisive word for transgender in India) after answering a science question in class, why his best friend asked him to speak 'properly' quite often, why the girls in school who he thought were his friends would laugh loudest whenever someone mocked him.

The young kid was speaking to me through his 40 year old body with dead soul and heart dessicated of love. Those elaborately big pupils were vibrating in bowls of his eyes causing a melancholic yet beautiful motion of water droplets that had accumulated there. The kid trapped inside the beefy body was trying his best to break out of prison. To finally free himself, to finally hug the person who opened his arms to accept him for who he was, who was ready to caress that kid like a Prince Charming of his secret dreams of his secret world.

I accepted him despite the reality of his marital status and it's affiliated risks. I knew the future. My baby did not. Or that's what I thought. He said lot of romantic, promising things to procure my consent.

After honeymoon phase got over, I was being sidelined, I was being insulted. The guy who said to me 'I have given past 15 years to my wife, rest is ours' after three months was telling me 'My wife will always be my first priority'. He inserted that out of blue in our seemingly mundane conversation. For 6-7 months I kept fighting for the relationship that died for him within 3 months of courtship. I went through depression, series of panic attacks, tremendous insecurity and jealousy on daily basis. He even talked me into discontinuing seeing my therapist who he thought was poisoning my mind against him.

10 months were about to complete. I was totally helpless, desperate and literally begging him to stay,trying to keep together the final thread of our relationship that could have broken any moment under slightest of tension.

There was a final phone call. Argument and begging went on... And he said to me 'you were my love. Now my wife is my wife and love'. I cut his call. Immediately called up his wife and divulged her that we had an affair. And just like that, I killed the child I loved with all my heart. Maybe I killed a big part of me that very moment.

Till this day, I don't know what's the truth. Was that kid real, fictitious? Was it a product of his fabrications to get me into bed? Was I really his escape? Was he really stuck in a loveless marriage as he claimed while wooing me? Was I victim of manipulation(something my rational mind and therapist agree upon) ? Guess, I would never know.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that when applying for a course in any English speaking country such as the UK, USA, Canada or Australia.....you have to do an English proficiency test such as the IELTS or TOEFL. And I know that IELTS scores are valid for only 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

But lets say you already completed an undergraduate course abroad. And now you want to pursue a master's course abroad again. Would you have to take the IELTS a second time when applying for the master's? Or would your undergraduate degree be enough? 

&amp;#x200B;

Lots of universities have said on their websites that international applicants must prove English proficiency by submitting IELTS results, but exceptions can be made if the student already has a degree from a predominantly English speaking country (USA, UK, Canada, Australia)

&amp;#x200B;

I've emailed some of the universities to confirm, Some have said that my undergraduate degree from the UK is good enough to prove my English proficiency. Some of them though have told me to re-do the IELTS.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I think most of those mails are written by clerks who give half-hearted answers and are just blindly pushing students to do the IELTS again because the IELTS is a profit-driven organization, and they just want money. The unis are affiliated with them. It makes no sense. If you've already proved your English proficiency when applying for your undergraduate course, why would you need to prove it again? 

&amp;#x200B;

Anybody else been through a similar experience? What did you do? Did you re-do the IELTS or just not bother with it?",,b7shue,,0,,false,1560318829,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b7shue/indians_whove_studied_abroad_do_you_have_to_do/,,,false,Non-Political,

A bit of background: I have been living in a fancy Canadian city for the past 5 years. During this time, I have come to understand myself and my identity became independent, I am no longer a foolish and an immature kid, I know how to voice my opinion and stay on the side of being just in whatever situation and with whoever it is (bitches don’t like it). My family is very very x1000 overprotective. They are so over protective that would not let me have any privacy in my room in case I trip over my bed and break my arm. Constant nagging every 30 minutes, phone calls in case I am out of sight for more than an hour are just a couple of things that are coming in my raging mind at the moment.

Coming back to the story, after living in that fancy Canadian city for 5 years, I decided to pay my family a visit in my home town as it was long overdue. The day arrived and I landed. I met them and everything was good. Come the next day, after hours of sleep, I thought I’d just go outside. Immediately every member of my family (mum, dad and sis) started saying that I am not allowed to ride my scooter. The reason was that I was still going through jet lag. Second day, as soon as I brought the topic again, the whole discussion started. They started saying that I have been out of practice and I would not be able to handle the traffic. The people on the roads will not care if they hit me, and as I have to go back, they don’t want me to have any accidents. For the next two days I didn’t raise the topic. Come the last Saturday, I started talking about it. My father got reeeeaaaaallly angry saying that he will not allow me to go as well. He is scared. My mother said that they love me and they don’t want anything to happen to me. My further questions were not entertained. I forced my mum to take my side today, and made the plan that we 3 (sis is currently in a university far away) would go out. Mum would be with dad and I would ride on a separate scooter under their observation. My dad literally shouted on me saying that that would not be happening. He said that I would get the ticket from the police if I am caught. I said that I have my licence, but he said that the insurance papers and the pollution check is not proper for any of the scooters. 

Now, I am a 28 years old guy and I would turn 29 this year. I have been independent for far too long to fall back into this pit. Even before going to Canada, I had the same mindset, but I was a dumb kid and was easily subdued. The point right now is that I have been staying home for the last two weeks. Barely have I left my home. Even if I go out walking, they want me back home as soon as possible. They have told me to not take any rickshaws as those guys drive very ruthlessly. I literally have nothing to do here and I am just bidding my time. I go into depression very easily and I am in one right now. I was very much down today with all the arguments and didn’t talk much with my parents. To this, my mum said that me not talking to them is breaking their hearts, and it is my responsibility to improve the environment in the home. They want me to understand their side as they love me and only want the best of me. If I say that they can try to do the same, but the reply would be that I have changed too much and gone out of their grasps. They said that they would take me everywhere I’d like to go, but I just want to go alone sometimes to some places.

I have just one and a half week left, and I am just counting days. I never wanted my trip to be like this and I would think at least 10 times before making the plans again.

So I went out and bought a jar of parachute coconut oil. Since then I've been using it frequently. 

I use it in stir frying vegetables and gives a lovely coconut smell to the food. highly recommend it. 

I also used it instead of butter when baking cake and it also was very nice. The hint of coconut was a great addition.

But my fav was to add a tea spoon of it to my tea. Yes, it does float to it top, as oil is wont to do, but I worked around that by drinking it out of my personal thermos which allows me to shake it well before drinking. It mixes just fine, and it makes me feel a new energy in the mornings that I havent really felt before.

I always prefer Faluknama/Godavari if I have to travel from Hyderabad to Visakhapatnam. Godavari is fine, you are not leered at, there would be no pan parak stains, no one sleeps on the floor of the coach, or if you get the lower berth people sit at the end. Faluknama always gives me nightmares. There was once two muslim guys without reservation, sat in our berths. We two, a female friend of mine and I, when we asked them to leave, they were quite adamant. Kafir is not the only word that came from their mouths. I had to bring the TC to throw them out. Even after they vacated the seats, one guy slept on the floor and my friend was freaked out with this. Always his hands were on the berth, or even sometimes legs too. We should not talk about the toilets here. They are the worst. Cigarettes, and all kinds of trash and people standing at the door. Complaints, and twitter complaints everything went in vain. No one responded. None. I would never travel in Faluknama again.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't know if this is the right sub. Point me to it if this isn't.

I purchased Microsoft Office 2016 Pro Plus keys from [oemkeys.in](https://oemkeys.in) on 18th December. I was waiting for an year end sale. Prices shown on the site were very lucrative and with discounts. So, naive me took the decision of paying them Rs.1439.10.

I was told to create an account on the website for payment. I did. The confirmation came almost instantaneously in the form of a series of mails - one for account confirmation, one for payment confirmation and one (after about 5 minutes) for the key. I will directly paste what was written below the key in the mail I received

&gt;""Key required to activate within 3 DAYS, we warranty 3 DAYS, in three days if you have any questions, please contact us!!!! We would like to help you out.""

At that point of time, I went to [microsoft.com](https://microsoft.com) and registered my purchase. Needless to say, everything happened without a hitch. I was happy.

This was 52 days ago.

Today, when I opened Microsoft Excel, it says that my product key activation has failed and I have 4 days to enter a valid product key! None of the other Office products work too. Microsoft store doesn't show any purchase (maybe they don't store OEM key purchases).

Ofcourse, [oemkeys.in](https://oemkeys.in) is inaccessible. It is ""under maintenance"".

Regarding the quote above - I presume whatever products they have there were made to work atleast 3 days so that even if the user comes on the 4th day, they can shake off any claim to their ""warranty"".

I think most people here are already careful enough to not fall for any of this but can happen. Attaching my receipt for proof

The restaurants jack up prices because of the added middleman in between.

Now we have to deal with Zomato/Swiggy riders, restaurant. Earlier, i just dealt with restaurant. 

The offers/discounts are laughable for the most part and only good for first time users. The ""free items"" for taking membership are laughably little items that are either towards the end of their shelf life, or are made in bulk.

Do we need Zomato/Swiggy in between for food delivery for the amount of trouble we have to go through? They were good as options to rate and find out good places to eat.

Hi Girls and Men of [/r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india). This is an awareness post for PMDD. The reason I wanted to make this post is because it has a lot of overlapping symptoms with other behavioral disorders and is in many cases mis-diagnosed to be bipolar or something else. In many cases it goes un-diagnosed for years causing several women to lose their careers, partners, kids, friends and destroys their peace of mind. Join the sub-reddit [/r/pmdd](https://www.reddit.com/r/pmdd) for more of peoples experiences dealing with. The awareness globally about this is generally poor, and Im sure a lot of people in India suffer from this and I just wanted to bring your attention here to look for symptoms and seek help.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a condition in which a woman has severe depression symptoms, irritability, and tension before menstruation. The symptoms of PMDD are more severe than those seen with [premenstrual syndrome (PMS)](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001505.htm).

PMS refers to a wide range of physical or emotional symptoms that most often occur about 5 to 11 days before a woman starts her monthly menstrual cycle. In most cases, the symptoms stop when, or shortly after, her period begins.

Many women with this condition have:

* Anxiety
* [Severe depression](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000945.htm)
* [Seasonal affective disorder](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001532.htm) (SAD)",,b6f1jx,,0,,false,1560294291,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b6f1jx/awareness_post_on_premenstrual_dysphoric_disorder/,,,false,Non-Political,

I started working about 3 months ago and now I am looking into buying my first motorcycle. I am looking at the Apache RR 310 which goes for about 2.45 lakhs (on road) in the city I am working in. I just started working so I can't pay it all at the moment. 

I am trying to get 70k saved in a couple of months and then use it as down payment and get the other amount in loan.

However, I am absolutely surprised by the HUGE interest rates. 

If I give 70k in down payment, I will have to take 1.8 lakh in loan. The interest rate I am getting for HDFC is 18.5% reduced (Don't know what reduced means), even though the spokesperson from HDFC said I will get 8% interest rate cause HDFC has a tie up with my company. I did include that I work for this company when I got the 18.5% rate.


This, over a period of 30 months, translates to roughly 2.3 lakhs with interest, besides the 70k that I will be paying as down payment. So instead of paying 2.45 lakhs I will be paying about 3 lakhs including interests. 50k extra is a lot! When I checked maxabout and other automobile websites, with 8% interest rate (as said by the spokesperson) the total interest came to be 25k, or roughly 2.7 lakh total. 

What's wrong here? Can someone with experience in this tell me what am I missing out or not understanding?

1546790550,india,Sant268,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ad6rr5/a_peek_in_reality/,6,6,,,A peek in reality.,"Hello; Everyone,

I am preparing for JEE Mains. And it is stressful. Especially this year.

I think I need to share a light on what is the students' perspective of the recent changes made by HRD of Indian Government to hold JEE Mains twice a year from now on.

Here are some of my points as to why this was a bad decision after all, and how it defeats the purpose of holding twice itself.

1. Ill-prepared Junior Colleges and Schools.

We have our State-board prelims from 9th of January, perfectly coinciding with the JEE January schedule (8th to 15th January). That means we have to juggle ourselves with coaching institutes, colleges and the self preparation altogether; which invariably has split up the students in two : Boards /CET and Mains.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Shorthand Notice.

&amp;#x200B;

This decision, of forming a separate entity to administer JEE was taken on July 12th. Sure,6 months to prepare but with no clarity as to what are the changes related to the paper. Those were released in October. Till then majority of coaching centres were stuck to their formulaic plan=To teach Mains after January (i.e. After Boards preparation is done)

This resulted in lesser time to study for students, as we had our Practicals,Journals and a shitload of other things which take place before December Prelims.

&amp;#x200B;

3.Type of Questions

&amp;#x200B;

Still, NTA has not clarified from where the questions will be derived. Since CBSE itself conduced JEE before, NCERT was enough for most of the content. But now, there is no framework for the questions to come, and that has benefited the devils itself. Label 'Crash Courses' by the coaching institutes.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Suicide.

The very reason (claimed,reason) for which NTA was formed. Their intuition was to held JEE twice so there will be lesser stress on students.

&amp;#x200B;

What were they thinking. With the '75%' minimum required for IITs; we needed time to prepare for Boards.Which is an entirely different ball-game altogether.

19 students,one of whom I personally  knew commited suicide in December 2018 alone.

Some say ""It's too early"" or ""The reason cannot be JEE alone""

Well then, what can it be? We are expected to sacrifice 2 years behind a notion, a dream which seems achievable but is the distant truth from the grim reality.

It isn't normal when students joke about suicide. (Yes they do, along with a nervous giggle that follows)

What does the society expect from us? The Heavenly gates of IIT isn't achievable for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

After all, we aren't even old enough for a driving license. And you expect us to drive our future early on.

Peace &lt;3

An hour passed in this way, and then two. When I asked them to cancel the order, that muppet told me that a cancellation fee equal to my order amount would be charged. I was like what the fuck?

Here's the entire conversation. That motherfucker kept blabbering about some cancellation policy, and when I asked him for it, he could not accept it.

Just read my amazing story and it will be cured. Especially the second last Para. Edit: Thanks in advance for your overwhelming expected support and responses.,"I was obviously working in an MNC earning 1.6 lack per month. And depressed. Then one day it occurred to me that I shouldn't be depressed. And that's how I overcome depression. If I can overcome depression you can too. What should you do? You do what I did. Make habits that cure depression. Easy.

Seriously though, I do appreciate those who are trying to make those who are under depression feel better. But you appear too hollow and pretentious to me. I am in a financially secure position and slightly depressed. I have seen depressed people. I try to learn about depression.

You can be successful financially and still be depressed. You can be successful career wise and still be depressed. You can be unemployed and penniless and still be depressed. Depression is not the cause of you being unemployed or penniless. To get into stable job is very difficult for an average Indian. Economic mobility is pretty low here. There are systemic flaws that keep poor perennially poor. The less wage you get, the more hours you work. There's a language barrier which effectively filter out a huge chunk of our population from having access to a comparatively humane job marketplace. But think about this. If you are depressed on top of being jobless and poor it makes improving your life far more harder. The normal everyday motivation that works for you, is not going to work for them. If you seriously ask yourselves ""what's the point?"" to every motivating reasons you currently hold, you will realise that your will to live, will to be happy, will to be healthy, will to be loved, will to be successful makes your motivating reasons relevant for you. It is never the other way around.

If you know any person going through depression, try and make them seek professional help. Sometimes physiological issues like hormonal imbalance will lead to depression. If that's the case there is no other way to help them than making them seek professional help. If that's not the case, then again, next best bet is making them visit their therapist regularly. This is difficult. Especially if they don't truly want to get out of depression. Yeah. There are depressed people who don't want to get out of depression as well. They are convinced that they right, and others call it depression. Never assume that what motivates you will motivate those under depression as well. The single most important thing you can do to help is never to enforce the belief that they are worthless for being depressed. You might have felt worthless yourselves on those odd occasions, maybe when you were rejected by your crush, when you were laid off, when you were scolded senseless by a stranger on the street. Try to Imagine that being the default, not some deep pit you fell down on odd occasions. You wouldn't want to tell those people to pull their socks up, would you? You see someone nearly dying in accident in front of you falling to the middle of road, you wouldn't honk your horn and tell them to get out of the road, would you? 

If someone is depressed, jobless and poor, they may try to get a good job and whatever advices you have for anyone looking for job can be lavishly given to them as well. If by some stroke of luck they happens to be in the few who make it from rags to riches in India, they still need to address their depression. That's a separate story.

I am sorry, I tried my best to be patriotic, but after hearing just one bad news after another, I have lost all hope in any political institution of this country. I want to do an MBA here and leave. It will after around 3 years. I want to immigrate to Europe, Canada or Australia. Any English speaking developed nation which isn't littered with garbage everywhere will do.

John F. Kennedy said in his inaugaration speech, ""Ask not for what the country can do for you, but what you can do for your country."" I have lived upon this philosophy for years, but now I am just broken. Today I tried to explain my local corporator why the pot holes need to be fixed and the ever so delayed road constructions needed to be completed. I was shooed away from his office.

I can't explain how defeated and miserable I feel. I wanted to be in a better college, but because I am from a particular caste, in-spite of scoring high marks I still didn't get in, and I don't have enough money to get foreign education.

My beliefs, ideal, philosophy and way of living is just not 'Indian'. It's western. I don't know why. I just want to be there.

I am just sitting here, after being perpetually annoyed by the loud music and drums for Ganapati visarjan, and I am just dreaming to be in some other country. Even 5 pegs of vodka aren't helping.

Anyways, back to immigration. Is it possible that I do my MBA here and apply to European companies? Will they accept my resume (if good enough ofc) or will they prefer local talent only.

People who immigrated, please can you tell your story? How you did it? What tips can you give me? I don't want to go to US because of sky high medical expenses. Europe (esp Germany) Canada and Australia are fine preferred options in that order. Please help me with at least the basic information on immigration.

Babar did not like India. In his memoirs, the famous Babar Namah, he set down his views in no uncertain terms:

""Hindustan is a country that has few pleasures to recommend it; the people are not handsome. They have no idea of the charms of friendly society, of frankly mixing together, or of familiar intercourse. They have no genius, no comprehension of mind, no politeness of manner, no kindness of fellow-feeling, no ingenuity or mechanical invention in planning their handicrafts, no skill or knowledge in design or architecture; they have no horses, no good flesh or bread in their bazaars, no baths or colleges, no candles, no torches, not a candlestick....""

The English translators of the memoirs went out of their way to echo Babar’s animus against India. The footnote beneath the passage quoted above reads: ""Babar’s opinions regarding India are nearly the same as those of most Europeans of the upper classes, even at the present day.""

Fortunately, there were some foreigners who loved India with as much passion as that with which Babar and ""most Europeans of the upper classes"" hated it. It is a curious fact that few countries of the world have aroused as much loathing or affection—it is one or the other—as India. This was as true five hundred years ago as it is today. It is not very surprising that Indians have become sensitive to other people’s opinions about them.

Indians usually divide foreigners into three different categories. Most numerous are the haters who dislike both India and the Indians. Next come the ‘half-haters’ who dislike Indians but like the Indian landscape and the conditions of living: big bungalows, servants, shikaar, polo, etc. The only natives they can suffer are the Gunga Dins of Rudyard Kipling—faithful as their dogs and who know their place. They particularly dislike educated Indians who are either babus (clerks) or, if Anglicised, wogs-wily oriental gentlemen. The third category consists of lovers who like everything about India and the Indians. They find Indian mysticism more satisfying than Christianity; Indian ragas more melodious than Beethoven’s symphonies; the dhoti more sensible dress than trousers; hot curries tastier than European food. They disdain mixing with their own nationals. They learn Indian languages. They eat with their fingers; their women wear saris, put a red spot on their foreheads and say namaste with the palms of their hands joined together. This third category is very small. Indians treat them as the lunatic fringe.

There remains, however, a fourth category—those whose reactions are uncertain. It is the fourth category which arouse the most lively speculation in Indian circles. Kenneth Tyson belonged to this category.

***

I first met Tyson in the bar of the Gymkhana Club sometime in the autumn of 1947—a couple of months after India had gained Independence. I was in a party of friends, a Bengali, a Punjabi and their respective wives. Tyson attracted attention as he entered. He towered over the crowd. He was bald. He limped. And he was the first Englishman seen in the place since the Club had passed into Indian hands.
""First white man in darkest Hindustan!"" remarked the Punjabi who fancied his wit.

""Who is he?"" I asked.

""Don’t you know Kenneth Tyson?"" he demanded. ""A box-wallah of the pucca sahib variety. One of the haters, a species becoming very rare in this country.""

Tyson limped up to the bar. The bearer greeted him with an effusive salaam and served him a brandy and ginger ale.

""What is he doing in India when all his ilk have fled?"" I asked.

""To have one last chhota peg before he puts in his resignation,"" suggested the Punjabi. ""Too many natives about the place for the likes of Kenneth Tyson.""

The Punjabi’s wife took up the theme with greater vigour. ""You should meet his wife—a real British memsahib, if there is one!"" She mimicked Mrs Tyson’s accent. ""M’deah, must keep the black man in his place. Give him an inch and he will take a yard. Wot!""

Everyone laughed.

""I think you’ve got Tyson wrong,"" protested the Bengali. ""I had dealings with him when he was posted in Calcutta. Although he did not mix very much with us, he quite obviously liked living there because he never went home on leave.""

""Half-hater!"" remarked the Punjabi lady. ""A half-hater married to a full-hater. Jennifer Tyson does not mince her words. ‘My deah, I’d rather scrub the floors in me own bed-sitter in Tooting Bec than live in one of them ruddy Oriental palaces waited on hand and foot by a horde of black flunkeys!’.""

""Poor woman, she’s had a hard time with someone or the other in her family going down with amoebic dysentery,"" pleaded the Bengali’s wife.

""Occupational disease of the hater,"" replied the Punjabi. ‘Ever known a lover go down with it? No. It’s always these chaps. They boil their drinking water and drown their vegetables in ‘pinkie’ but the amoebae gets them. It’s the ‘Delhi belly’ or the ‘Bombay belly’ or the belly of whatever place they happen to be in. Then like the Mullah who runs from his home to his mosque five times a day, the hater’s beat is between his bedroom and the lavatory. It is on the antiquated thunderbox that the White man has the blackest thoughts about India.""

Tyson turned around; he had obviously sensed that he was being discussed. The Bengali waved to him. Tyson picked up his drink and limped towards our table. ""May I join you?"" he asked as he pulled a chair from the next table.

""With pleasure! May I introduce you to my friends...""

We shook hands. We pressed drinks on him. He accepted without fuss. ""I don’t mind if I do; a last one for the road. The same for me, bearer, please."" He had three double brandies before he stood up. ""Now if you’ll forgive me, I’ve got my little girlfriend waiting for me in the car. I must get her home.""

As soon as he left, the discussion on Tyson was resumed with even greater animosity. ""Not a bad chap, is he?"" demanded the Bengali who had introduced us. ""One must not make facile generalisations about people. He is quite willing to make friends with Indians.""

""Now, perhaps,"" hissed the Punjabi lady. ""And with suckers who will go on offering him drinks. He didn’t bother to return one.""

""Now really!""

""Oh shut up!"" exploded the lady. ""Your kind make me sick. Not a bad chap, Tyson; he accepts drinks from the blacks.""

No one took up the challenge. The lady continued her tirade, ""His woman is worse than him. She graciously accepts gifts from her Indian acquaintances who keep fawning on her. But she will not allow her children to mix with theirs. ‘My deah, it is not the colour of their skin I mind—my God I am not that narrow!—but I cannot bear to have my kids speaking their awful chi-chi sing-song!’.""

""I think you’ve got a chip on your shoulder about this black-white business,’ protested the Bengali. ""If they do not like it, what is it that keeps them here?""

""Hasn’t found a good job in England,"" retorted the Punjabi lady. ""His wife is out there on a reconnoitering expedition.""

The analysis continued. Someone quoted Tyson’s opinion on Indian sculpture: ""Them eight-armed monstrosities, you can have them, and with my compliments!"" As to Indian literature, Tyson echoed the views of his distinguished compatriot—""One shelf of a library in Europe is worth more than the entire learning of the East. I did not say that, Lord Macaulay did."" Indian music ""bores me to tears"". He could not play polo or go out to shikar. What then kept him in India? And why did he forgo his home leave year after year? Did he have a native mistress tucked away somewhere?

***

I found the answers a few months later. I shall narrate the circumstances which led to their discovery. I was in the habit of taking my dog for a walk every evening. Our favourite promenade was through a beautiful park in which there were many tombs of the Lodhi dynasty. We used to return home before sunset to avoid running into jackals who were known to become vicious during the mating season—and often rabid. One evening we were later than usual. It had got dark; only the domes of the Lodhi mausoleums could be seen silhouetted against the twilight. I quickened my pace and called my dog. The smell of tobacco wafted across the green. I saw the figure of a tall man smoking a pipe and twirling a leash in his hand. When I came closer I noticed his companion; it was a Dachshund. Its front half was inside a hole in the ground; its rear was marked by a rat-like tail swishing in the air. The sound of my feet distracted the Dachshund. It backed out of the hole, shook the earth off its nose with a loud snort and came yapping towards me.
""Stop it, Martha! Stop it at once!""

""Good evening, Mr Tyson.""

""Oh, hello."" He had not recognised me, but seeing I was a Sikh, added, ""Good evening, Mr Singh. Taking a stroll in the park? Lovely this time of the evening, isn’t it? Oh, stop it, Martha!""

Martha scampered back and plunged into the rat hole. ""She’s quite happy as long as she has some place to stick her nose into,"" remarked Tyson, looking proudly at his dog. ""All dogs are like that. My last one—I lost her two months ago—she used to do exactly the same.""

""I am afraid mine’s a little more demanding in the way of exercise. He’s rather large and we live in a small flat,"" I explained. The words were barely out of my mouth when Simba, my German Shepherd, loomed out of the dark. He saw Martha’s wiggling tail and applied his inquisitive nose to her posterior. Martha shot backwards, ticked off Simba with a few effeminate yaps and then began to circle around him at breakneck speed.

""Too big for you, girlie! Leave him alone. Come along now, it’s getting very late,"" he ordered. ""Sweet, isn’t she?""

""Very cute,"" I replied. I sensed that he did not want to linger on. ""Good night, Mr Tyson. Come along, Simba.""

Thereafter I saw Tyson almost every evening in Lodhi Park. I exercised Simba by doing several rounds of the park. Tyson preferred to stay in the one part which had many rat holes. His Dachshund busied itself ferreting for rodents while her master waited patiently by smoking his pipe and twirling the leash in his hand. There they stayed long after sunset. Some evenings I saw his tall figure against the dusk; sometimes the smell of tobacco indicated that he was still somewhere on the lawn. His parting words were always the same. ""That’s enough for the evening! Time to go home. Come along, Martha sweetie."" The bitch would extricate herself, cock her head at her master as if pleading for ‘just one more rat’; then have a quick sniff inside the hole, a loud snort outside and scamper off happily at her master’s heels.

The years passed without Tyson taking his home leave. ""I can go when I like, you know,"" he explained. ""My leave will accumulate and then I will have a couple of years at one go. Wouldn’t that be nicer?""

""But you can’t accumulate the passage money.""

""Oh that! Who cares for a piddling passage!""

After some years people stopped asking why Tyson did not go home. During the winter months when his wife was in Delhi, they did a certain amount of entertaining. In the summer when she was away, people asked Tyson over for supper because they thought he was lonely. He always took Martha with him. He left her in the car: the leash was always in his hand.

The years added layers of fat to Martha. Like all ageing Dachshunds, Martha, who had never been mated, began to look chronically pregnant with a belly that barely cleared the ground. Tyson became more solicitous in his address.

""Nice old gal; she’s getting on, you know. She’s thirteen—which makes her over eighty if she were human. Mustn’t tire yourself out, lady.""

After letting her ferret for a while, he would pick her up and take her back to the car. Martha grunted and sighed in the arms of her adoring master.

***

One summer evening I happened to be visiting an English friend when Tyson dropped in for a drink. He let Martha out of the car. Our host had an equally aged Bull Terrier bitch. The two waddled about in the flower beds while we sipped our Scotch in the garden.
""Bet you’d like to get out of this now if you could,"" remarked our host referring to the stillness and the heat; the thermometer had been touching 112 degrees every day of the past week. ""Think how nice it would be in a country pub somewhere along the Thames near Richmond! I’d give my left arm to be back in old Blighty.""

Tyson had been through this before. ""I don’t mind it, you know! The dry heat agrees with me. Anyway there are all the remaining years of one’s life.""

Tyson did not answer. We relapsed into silence. The only sounds were the tinkling of ice in the tumblers and the chirping of crickets. Tyson lit his pipe.

Martha sneezed in the flower bed. The Bull Terrier bitch joined her. The two snorted in unison, then began to squeal with excitement.

""A bandicoot, I bet,"" exclaimed our host, turning back. ""Get it, Flossie! They are a damned nuisance. Come creeping into the house and leave droppings as large as snails. Get it, Flossie!"" he commanded.

The dogs redoubled their efforts, yapping and squealing. Every now and then they looked up at their masters for instructions.

A bandicoot ran out of the hole—crying tikkee, tikkee, tikkee. It ran across the lawn towards us. The dogs chased it yapping at a higher and higher pitch. We put up our legs on the table and shouted encouragement to the dogs. ""Here, Martha! Here, Flossie!""

The bandicoot turned sharply and made for the road; its shrill tikkee, tikkee marking a sound trail. The dogs ran after it as fast as they could; the Bull Terrier led the chase by a few yards. The rodent crossed the road and ran down a dry storm-water drain on the other side. The Bull Terrier was hot on its scent. Martha got to the middle of the road when the headlights of a car diverted her attention. She stopped and turned her large brown eyes towards the glare. A second later the car had gone over her.

Tyson leapt up from his chair and ran out. Martha’s back was broken; she wriggled like an earthworm cut in half. Tyson picked her up in his arms and brought her in. His eyes were blurred with tears.

His host rang up for the vet. The vet drove up a few minutes later. He examined Martha and shook his head. He took out a syringe from his bag, loaded it with a fluid and jabbed the needle into the Dachshund. ""That will put her out of her misery,"" he explained.

Martha died with her large eyes fixed on her master. Tyson broke down and wept like a child.

I did not see Tyson in Lodhi Park again. A few days later notices appeared on the boards of local clubs announcing the sale of his crockery, cutlery and furniture. He was not going on leave; he had resigned his job and was leaving India for good.

A fortnight later he was at the airport. His English friends and the Indian staff of his office came to see him off. He was his usual quiet, phlegmatic self. He made polite conversation and bowed his head to let the Indians put garlands around his neck. When the loudspeaker announced the departure of his flight, he shook hands without any trace of emotion on his face.

""Well, Tyson, you are off at last,"" remarked one of his English friends. ""We almost believed you were going to settle down here and take on Indian nationality.""

""No ruddy fear!"" replied Tyson, waving his hand in farewell. ""It’s these damned uncivilised laws England has for animals. How can you leave a dog you love in quarantine for six months, I ask you?""",,atwcr2,,0,,false,1553245245,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,orkut,false,true,,/r/india/comments/atwcr2/np_india_is_a_strange_country_by_khushwant_singh/,,,false,Non-Political,

Obviously he hid his marital status initially. Even real age. When I got to know it, I reprimanded him about cheating explaining how infidelity is wrong. He was adamant that he was attracted to me, he would move forward anyway which I had clearly shown reluctance to. By the time his marital status was revealed to me, we had bonded really really well. Like bestest of friends. We surely didn't wanna lose that bond. I conveyed my clear NO to him. I although admitted to him that I too was attracted to him but wouldn't continue because of his marital status. He can choose to divorce his wife if he wants to pursue me is what I had made clear. 

Things were going out of hands. We were meeting everyday. Discussing on everything under the sun. Getting closer every day. He even proposed me. Forced me to say I love him too. I was guilty. Caught him using the dating app secretly once. Forgave him. We started getting intimate because I thought he's driven to the app because of my reluctance to have sex.

He used to say stuff like I did mistake by marrying, I have given 15 years to my wife, now rest is ours, there's nothing left between his wife and him  I finally accepted that I'm in love with a married guy and would be his mistress because I was happy with his love, attention. Before you all judge me, I earn 6 digit salary as fresher. So I'm not gold digger. I never had any malice for his family. I adore his daughters. Even help them in their studies. 

After 3 months, he started ignoring me a little. Upon discussion with him. he did not admit that he was doing it but told me his wife had started doubting him. He started ignoring me more and more with time. It was becoming unbearable for me. Now I started hearing statements like 'my wife will always be my first priority' out of blue, thrown at me. I had to move to another city. I sunk in depression. Saw therapist. She told me it's all red flag filled. She suggested us to come clean to his wife and continue with her consent. He would say therapist is riling me up against him. He cajoled me into stopping seeing her. 

His behavior wasn't getting any better. Now he started saying 'my wife has always been there. I have been loving her since forever'. I was seriously insecure and demanding some security from him. A few days live in every month was my suggestion. My therapist has suggested me to not say no to me while saying yes to him. 

December I came back to my town. He was finding it difficult to devote half the time he used to have for me earlier. I started being entitled now. I asked him to either leave me or treat me equally. He sunk in depression now. I took him to therapist as contrast to his support to me- 'koi depression nahi hai tuze'. Therapist opened his eyes. He was faced with his incapacity of treating us equally forever without being impartial or making either of us mad. He chose his wife. (earlier in the 'pataoing phase, when I would tell him that married guys always choose family, he would say nooooo you don't know how much I love you. He would even criticize a friend of him getting played by a married dude) 

I was hurt. Fucking hurt. He chose his wife and changed his attitude so smoothly like we never even met. He even had confided me once that he had taken advantage of his employee once. I thought enough is enough and predator needs to be stopped now. 

I called up his wife and told her briefly that i was having affair with her husband who just dumped me. She was shocked. I'm sure he must have lied her and made up a story painting me as a horny whore who threw herself at him. He blocked me from everywhere. So much for best friends forever.. 

I miss him terribly. TBH the friendship and support.

Assuming that most homes in large cities these days have high speed broadband, and smart TVs, fire tv and chromecast aren't uncommon either, this option should be way cheaper. There would be no restriction on what channel you can view and you don't have to go through the headache of optimising your channel pack with your provider. This would be even more economical if you have 2-3 TVs in your home and you have to pay for cable subscription for all of those.

I watch almost no cable TV, and don't know how much this holds true. Am I missing something here? Or is there more to it?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having a tough time taking this decision. Me and my wife earn a combined income of about 20lpa and our cost of living is literally 0 (because we live in my parents' home and there's food in our office all the time). 

I have a job offer from a company in Singapore that offers about 80k Singapore dollars. Work-wise, I don't think there is anything amazing about the Singapore company (my current job is far more challenging). If I were to take the offer, my wife would have to quit her job here in India and look for a job there after getting a dependent visa. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to take the job offer, it seems like for the next 2-3 years I would only save half of what I would if I continued my current job, but I could get a lot of fresh perspectives and international experience which may benefit me in the long run. Plus Singapore's good quality of life.

Maybe it's more of need to talk in a place that has probably more sane people than your average Joe (Too much /r/iamverysmart material? Not intended).

&amp;#x200B;

The origin of these thoughts might sound very silly but I was playing PUBG Mobile like thousands of others, hoping to relax during the weekend. However, the feeling was short lived when all of a sudden Pakistan somehow comes up and everyone is jumping left and right and spewing hate. For those of you who don't know, in the game, it's only 4 people in the team who are having this conversation. I just casually mention ""What's done is done but people should do something from their side. Donate to the Martyr's fund. Do SOMETHING rather than spreading hatred"". Next thing I know, people are calling on me out for being a Pakistan sympathizer and ""one of them"". And if it doesn't sound too bad, one of them is my friend for 7 years who is doing this.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that being born in a Muslim family, I am pretty easy target for such trolling. But being someone who is absolutely not interested in anything religious and totally being of the opinion of ""live and let live"", it's quite frustrating at the end of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

What baffles me is knowing that these are same people who are:

1. Racist to the core of their heart. Generalizing people with sentences like ""Are you from Bihar?"" (I condemn that too, mind you).
2. Cut corners everyday in life.
3. Do not pay a rupee of tax and are of the opinion that ""government is corrupt and doesn't deserve a pie"".
4. Afraid of being generalized by Western population.

&amp;#x200B;

I get it: Pakistan is wrong. The attacks were horrific and should be totally condemned. But you can't have your cake and eat it too. If you're tagging every Pakistani and Kashmiri as terrorist, might very well be comfortable with the idea of being tagged as a rapist if you're an Indian male. Too bad, that boils their blood, that kicks of their logical and rational thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

You might say I am over-reacting and should probably ignore these talks. But it's worrying because these folks are all out ready to ""kick Kashmiri people's ass"" and that can only be ignored for so long. One day, they are gonna grow the balls and go out and do it. And I do not want to live with the guilt that I might have stopped if not every, at least one of those.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to remember a few years ago, I did not witness such toxicity. Am I growing older and realizing more of these stuff? Is the country really garnering hatred among each other? Am I surrounded by toxic people more than I am with good people? I do not know the answers. All I know is **I am done with hatred**. There's so much in the world to do. I just want everyone to go out and seize that opportunity without being involved in BS (pardon my French).",,atzgh7,,0,,false,1553246759,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/atzgh7/the_air_is_getting_too_toxic/,,,false,Non-Political,

Few years ago it was 150 to 200. Ved Niketan which gives it for Rs 150 did not allow him for some reason. He said he does not like Couchsurfing or Hostels because he wants privacy. He is right. My CS host was annoying and in hostels, you will be distracted by people coughing, sneezing, furniture making noise when the person above you rolls.

For food unware people usually end up in commercialized places like Chotiwala which scams them by giving a Thali for Rs 250 to Rs 300. They usually have no clue about Gita Bhawan Canteen that gives 4 puri and chole for just Rs 20 per plate (I love this place. An open kitchen in which you can see women making food so there is no risk of some man scratching his underwear before making the food) . Vanaprastha gives for Rs 75 per plate. Parmarth gives Rs 50 to 70 per plate.  In these ashrams these foreigners don't get vegan food always and they might have to compromise with their nutritional health.

For transport, this guy was at vikram stand and the Vikram wala offered to take him to Railway Station for Rs 200 for private Vikram. I think it should have been Rs 100. This tatooed caucasian foreigner said ""Fuck you"" to the vikramwala and then sat in the other shared vikram in which I started conversation with him. This vikram takes between Rs 10 to Rs 20.


Reason - Capitalism in such basic things is the reason for all these problems. Chotiwala, Vikram wala, Hotels will keep on increasing prices till the time innocents and ignorants keep paying for it. Private sector works for short term profit. The Public Sector shall work for long term profits.

Solution - The government has to establish ""Saral Yatra Centre"" (SYC) in every Tourist city like Rishikesh, Dharamshala, Jaipur before we lose these foreign tourists forever. This is very urgent. A country like India that is not yet good in AI, Manufacturing, Robotics etc has to depend on Tourism and its Himalayan Beauty.

So a SYC would have [simple private rooms](https://i.imgur.com/crO1w0x.png),

I wrote this post because a reddit search returned nothing and i thought people would like to know.

Interview scare - Last time I attended interview , I was just out of college. I am pretty scared and words don't really come out in an interview now.

when i buy a bunch of stuff at supermarket, I see different items are in different GST slabs.   
&amp;nbsp;  
[0] does the shop pay GST to govt on per-slab basis ?  
[1] how does the govt know which slabs contribute how much tax?  
[2] does the govt know which items/categories in each slab contribute how much tax, on macro level (eg detergent/bread/cigarette) ? how?    
&amp;nbsp;  
when I buy at 'kirana shop' , there is no bill, no card, no gst. only cash.     
&amp;nbsp;  
[3] how do these shops pay GST to govt ?   
[4] if they don't pay GST to govt, why do they sell things at MRP (incl all taxes) rate and not at MRP minus GST rate ?   
&amp;nbsp;  
there are such shops (hardware, paints, electrical, timber, tools, pharma, groceries, jewelleries, restaurants, etc all kinds)  that do business for average Rs10,000 an hour x 10hrs a day x 25 days a month = Rs 3,00,00,000 a year. **only cash, no card, no bill.**  at the max they give a scribbled paper that has ""estimate"" on the top. so, no tax.  
&amp;nbsp;   
[5] how do such businesses pay GST, without any record on what-items-sold-at-what-slab details ?   
[6] how does govt know whether they're correctly reporting sales &amp; GST?  
[7] how were things in pre-GST era , and how is compliance improved in GST regime ?    
[8] in addition to bringing multiple taxes (service tax, VAT, excise duty, sales tax, etc) under single label GST, what other things does GST include to improve compliance &amp; collection?

Regular online stores like Amazon and Flipkart have products that are too cheap and too costly, even low quality ones with glowing reviews, and thus make it difficult to choose.

So a place like Headphone Zone was a refreshing concept, as they focus purely on one segment of products and *seem* to do it well.

The problem arises when you read negative reviews ranging from 2016 to 2018 about post-sale customer experience with these guys on Quora and Reddit. So, I don't want to shell out INR 5k and my trust if a company is going to give me damaged products or bad warranty.

Of course, I also keep in mind that people are *more vocal about negative experiences than positive experiences* and that tends to cloud our judgement.

So, I want Randians to tell me your experience with Headphone Zone before I make my first audiophile purchase.",,aeg1g9,,0,,false,1552618927,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/aeg1g9/please_tell_me_your_experience_with_headphone_zone/,,,false,Non-Political,

My elderly neighbour has been getting the sms of outgong being barred within a few days. It also says that there would be a deduction of Rs 23/- from the main balance if no recharge is done. (apparently the neighbour has about Rs 40 for emergency situations)

Is there anyway to stop this auto deduction from taking place? As I understand, the outgoing gets barred first and then after a few days, the incoming gets disabled as well. This triggers the grace period and a customer can get a recharge done during this period as well. But auto deduction takes away this 'privilege'. Any way to allow a customer the recharge without getting main balance deducted?

It was quite disturbing to watch that. Crops being grown on toxic water as they have no other choice. Worst part is they're aware of the consequences, the diseases and conditions it'll bring upon them and yet they're forced by circumstances to consume it as its almost impossible to sell such polluted / low-quality yield. Sushil Mahapatra then interviews the villagers, one couple says they have skin problems and many others in the village have it too, then there are some scary cancer statistics mentioned in the report by the health minister of Haryana himself.  
I believe this is the news, people need to be aware of issues like these occurring around our country. This is a totally unnecessary suffering, I do not know the solution to this, but I would like to see governments at least taking initiative to solve these or at least take interest in these issues. They've been suffering from this for years that now it has just become a way of life for them. God knows when will Prime Times will host debates on these or question local leaders on these things. Its very sad.

Since I got new PC, I got myself in to streaming games and enjoying it a lot. Its been almost 10 months now and i have a small community on YouTube who support me ( by watching stream, donations, memberships etc). Got around 2700 subs in last 10 months (Weekends only stream schedule) without getting raided/hosted by anyone. (except few raids from friends).

Currently, everyone is obsessed with PUBGM and those who play variety of games don't get much exposure because of it. As per my experience this current gen is not even aware about the FC, AC, Metro, Hitman series. Every time I play a new game, they ask me to play PUBGM or ask if this game is available on phone.

Recently, I was doing my musical stream where I play single player game (it was AC:O) and run music in background. Next day, a copyright strike for playing music. I have had this happen so many times &amp; I just mute the audio later in stream. This time it was ban on live streaming for 90 days.

WTF YouTube ? Why can't you be nice like Twitch? They just mute the audio automatically after stream in VOD's. So after thinking a lot and in quest of getting some mature audience, I moved to Twitch and I actually enjoy it without any fear of getting banned. I had to start from zero but I am Ok with it.

Yesterday, few people form this came and spent 2 hours with me on stream and we had a nice discussion going on various topic.

I am on my way to become a Twitch affiliate now. Appreciate if you guys can hangout with me while we play some nice music and games and have a mature discussion on games or just about anything. I am also looking for friends to play co-op games or grind Destiny 2 or anything that's fun.

I obviously thought its a scam ,but then he went me his 

AADHAR,army canteen card,driving licence,photos of bike with Bangalore number,and the bike registration, he also used emotional blackmail saying to ""trust the uniform""


Me still skeptical went to the govt site where I got the last 3 digits of the mobile linked to the Aadhar, and he verified them too!


Now with a heavy mind I thought of considering to send the money to ship the bike, he asked for 6.25k advance to start the paperwork and create all the shipping papers, he said he will ship by army courier


And he sent a picture and video of the army courier receipt too with my name and address written on it!


Now I was convinced I got a good offer and transferred him the rest , totally upto 25k the next day , considering him a honarable army major.


Such a fool I am!

Atleast I had the sense to do the payments through my Citi credit card and Paytm.


I filed dispute with Citi and they promised to reverse the credit within 48hours and investigate the case.

I also filed complaint with Paytm and got all the numbers n wallets that called me block on paytm(he even has KYCed Paytm saving account) 

The ""major"",the army transport officer, the army courier guy.


The guy keeps calling and asking ""what I did with his Paytm account""


Once more instructions come from Citibank dispute officer,I will file a police complaint and give Paytm the police directive (a mail from police to Paytm) and Paytm will give the KYC to police and they will hopefully catch him.


Tldr: got scammed on 25k sent via Citi credit-&gt;paytm-&gt;scammer trying to buy scooter from a organized gang acting as army officers. Filed dispute with Citibank hopefully will get money back in fraud protection scheme(goods/services not delivered)

Currently Reddit only allows two pinned slots that we use to sticky the scheduled threads but most of the time some scheduled threads don't get pinned because we had to pin some more important threads. This way the threads don't get enough stickied time and hard to find even for a regular user.

From today I'll be posting a thread where I'm gonna collect, update all the scheduled threads that are going on currently. That thread gonna stay pinned until some important thread comes up and will get pinned later.

Please advise what to do now,"I did not realize that I lost it before I was about to leave for work today morning. It was not at the place I always keep it.

I probably dropped it yesterday afternoon in the uber I took. I tried calling the driver on which he called me yesterday for my exact location before pickup but now he is not picking it up after repeatedly calling the number. I even registered my mobile number at uber's lost an item section. I did get a call from uber but the driver even then didn't pick up.

The problem is that it had everything important of mine. Two debit cards, two-three membership cards, a metro card, all my ids in original (Pan, Aadhar and Voters' card)

What all should I do to get it back? Feeling lost and very insecured. Please help!


Edit:
After I stopped freaking out, I realized I had digilocker where aadhar has been issued already. I was worried someone might misuse it having the original one. 

Secondly, I have all my documents scanned and uploaded on my hard drive and digilocker. Also have pan card issued by digilocker. 

Since the afternoon, I have applied for a fresh PAN card with my previous details and had to pay 350 bucks online. Will take printout and affix photos and post on the given address. 

Lastly, the one thing that will make me work hard is the voter card. I am a registered voter of South Kolkata but now settled in New Delhi. so, have to go a long way to get that done. 

Thank you all for the kind replies and advices. You all are amazing people.

I was charmed by the curiosity to know about the different events happening all around our country, as well as the world... Newspapers were partially responsible for igniting my interest in GK and Trivia.


Nowadays, reading newspaper feels more like a ""burden"".. it's like, someone put a heavy sandbag on my back that I have to shoulder for the rest of my life.. and I can't drop it either.


Every single day I open the newspaper, there's usually two things:
1. Politicians slinging mud at each other.

2. Someone being murdered/raped/attacked/killed, etc.

In short... ISSUES


Most of the time, I just dont want to open it because I know there's going to be the same thing.


I don't say this to my dad because I know he will get angry on me.

For this reason, I switched from TOI to Hindu; but even that's no good.


I wish I could go on a news diet and just forget about what's happening around me.

Hello! I got Excitel Installed few weeks back (last week of December). Since then I have been facing a lot of issues with it.

But, **Last 26 days have been the worst nightmare for me.**

**Last 26 Days of Excitel:**

31st Jan - 5th Feb : Speed Issues

9th Feb - 11th Feb: Speed Issues (Continued..)

13th Feb - 14th Feb: Speed Issues

16th Feb - 16th Feb: Connectivity Issue (Fiber Cut)

19th Feb - 19th Feb: Connectivity Issue (No Global Ticket)

25th Feb - 26th Feb: Connectivity Issue (Internet was down for more than 28 hours) https://i.imgur.com/1iaIPqQ.png

**26th Feb - 26th Feb: Very Slow Speed**
https://i.imgur.com/MekG8QR.png

**27th Feb - Today: Huge Packet Loss**
https://i.imgur.com/qdmbCkU.png

    ping google.com -t

**17 out of 27 Days, Internet didn't work properly. That is half month, Excitel's Services were poor / didn't work.**

**Resolution / Duration to Fix**: They have maximum resolution of 48 hours for any kind of complaint. So most of the time, LCO would only come to fix the issue at the ending hours of the 48 hours.

**Nodal/Appellate**: Both of the Higher Authority are no different from the Generic Customer Support. Both of them are limited to take any kind of action against LCO.

**Issues with Excitel**: 

* Packet Losses
* Disconnection while Rain (and won't solve automatically until Engineer visit)
* If your LCO don't have power backup, Internet will not work when there is a power cut.
* LCO is the real boss and if he's shit. You are going to have shit experience (like myself).
* Support Desk (Including Nodal) don't have any authority or quality check over the LCO. They are bound to wait and wait only for LCO to take any kind of action and fix.

**Support Tickets Since Installation of Connection**: https://i.imgur.com/xsNl24l.png

**Averagely, every 2nd day, there is a new issue with Excitel.**

**Short Note**: Don't take Excitel if you want reliable internet and If you take, better get a backup such as Airtel Broadband or Jio 4G Setup because Excitel will go off a lot of time.

I've been using Internet for 18 years now and Excitel is the most worst service I've ever experienced in my entire life. It was the first time in my entire life that the Internet was off for more than 28 hours and Support Desk was not able to help me except for waiting for the LCO to take any kind of action.

**Don't Get Excitel and never pay them for multiple months. They won't refund.**",,av1sda,,0,,false,1553266556,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/av1sda/excitel_broadband_review_15_out_of_26_days/,,,false,Non-Political,

Really appreciate your innovative 4G LTE product and I want you to know that I was one of the first to try it when you launched back in 2016.

But recently, I shifted to Hulimavu area in Bangalore and my average internet speed dwindled from 5 mbps to 0.5 mbps :(. The problem seems to be with the tower here which doesn't seem to handle the load. The speed is acceptable (~1 mbps) in the early mornings and afternoons when there is less activity, but it crawls down to less than 0.2 mbps in the evenings and late nights.

The dBm value is about -115 which could be an indication of poor signal strength too but you will know better. The place is Dodda Kammanahalli road at the south of Hulimavu lake ([this area](https://i.imgur.com/7C5nDKe.png) to be precise).

I know that the voice of a common Indian doesn't carry much weight in a country of 1.6 billion, but I'm still doing it because that's the least I could do. And besides, since the very mission of Jio was to make data accessible and affordable to the masses, I'm hopeful that my query will be listened to. I request you to solve the connectivity issue in my area by installing a new tower or repeater or whatever.

Regards,

An humble Indian citizen.",,as79fy,,0,,false,1553214045,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/as79fy/open_letter_to_reliance_jio_from_an_indian/,,,false,Non-Political,

A precursor to films like Angamali Diaries, Delhi 6 is a sprawling, dense, novelistic, film that throws you into a community, leaving you submerged under layers of culture and history and custom. Every frame is bursting with life. Every character, regardless of screentime, becomes flesh and blood, dripping with their own prejudices and loves and beliefs. It's chaotic and it's beautiful. Delhi 6 doesn't feel like a ""film"", written and directed in order to meet some studio mandate. It's a film that feels ""grown"", subplots and supporting characters branching off of each other.

* Internet is a weird place, the amount of information available is so mind boggling. It is very easy to be confused, get manipulated, indoctrinated etc. since most of us have don't have the mental tools to handle this avalanche of information available here.

When you find like minded people, or communities, it becomes very easy to feel justified, that community becomes a safe space, which can be helpful but sometimes it quickly becomes a circle-jerk, it leads to closing up of your mind, you become paranoid, full of hatred specially when you visit toxic websites and forums.

It is very important that you regularly get out of your comfort zone and talk to people you don't agree with or simply take some days off the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

Completed my BTech in 2015.  

Worked 6 months in a decent company as software engineer.   

  

Then idk what took over. Maybe because I was scared/lazy (idk what) people floated thought of preparing for SSC CGL exam. Talked to parents ( both being government servant) supported it, once even encouraged me to leave job and prepare for the same. Since to and fro from office to home 3-4 hours daily and physical health was getting impacted, with support of parents I took the leap and left the job with 2 months to prepare for SSC CGL 2016.  



I wasn't good enough couldn't clear the pre. Gave IBPS po 2016, couldn't clear the Gk section in mains by .15 marks. It was okay, my first attempt, still 23 year old.  Not much time wasted. A lot of opportunities to come.  

  

Since the focus was mainly on SSC I decided to focus on SSC only, didn't give any other exam, since the pattern of SSC / IBPS exams is different. Reason was that by the end of the year I would know my SSC result and decide what to do next. Fill other forms if needed.  

  

But due to many hurdles in between the examination process was completed only in Q3 of 2018. It had been more thsn 2 years since I was without job.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then cases of cheating came up, and a case in supreme court is being going on since then.  

While forms of SSC CGL 2018 came out and the exam. Hasn't been conducted since then. The fate of CGL 2017 is still unknown. 

  

I filled forms of banks in 2018, decided to not let go of any other opportunity.  

  

Couldn't clear SBI po 2018 pre since it was on the same day as CGL 2018 descriptive paper so I was kinda tired after giving the descriptive paper, and traveling an hour to give the exam. Plus couldn't prepare much for it since focused on descriptive since it was the first priority. It was only after conducting of SSC CGL 2017 descriptive supreme court put a hold on result, stating while the hearing was going how could SSC continue with the examination process.  

&amp;#x200B;

  

Then gave IBPS po, cleared pre but couldn't appear for the mains since I had fallen ill at that time.  

Have IBPS clerk and SO it officer. Result of mains of clerk is awaited, while so it interview is pending.  

Meanwhile gave niacl assistant exam

Cleared all stages but couldn't make it the final list. Gave 2 more exams. Didn't clear the mains of one, and pre of the second. While giving the pre of second I was mentally tired. Was my 4th examination that month and couldn't perform my best.  

   

With that you knowing about me.  

Idk whether I want to continue with the pursuit of getting into administrative positions in government jobs.  

  

Now I'm lost what to do. The plan was to do SSC get a job then figure out what to do. Whether to go for PSUs or go for higher studies or IAS. 

&amp;#x200B;

But preparing for these exams I realised that I don't have the aptitude to prepare for IAS exam. Can't sit for IES since computer science isn't a subject in it. I have no faith in SSC to conduct the CGL in a timely manner. Also unless the fait of CGL 2017 is finalized I doubt anything will be done.  

  

I'll hopefully either end up as a clerk/or it officer in a bank looking at my state now.   

  

But this is not what I signed up for. If I had stayed with my original job I'd be making more than what clerk/it officer would pay me. Probably even more than the jobs in scl 2017.   

Even if I settle for a mediocre pay, the work in banks is as hectic if not worse than private companies. Hearing the experience of people working in bank, I when I was in an active project in my job had a better work-life balance.  

  

If I have to work that much, I'd rather work to get a high income private job, since the pay in government/banks etc isn't good. if I had stayed in private since 2015 I would probably be drawing quite a decent salary by now. The career growth isn't that good in banks aswell.  

  

I only see two options now. First is to go for MBA. But with the 3 year gap, it will be extremely difficult to get into the top MBA colleges. At this point I don't want to do anything from less than the best. But I never wanted to pursue MBA. If I wanted to I wouldve taken a course in DU then worked for an MBA degree. I had decided that since I was in 12th. But it seems one of the only path to get a good paying job in private sector in the next 2-3 years.  

  

Or I can now prepare for gate ( which in hindsight feel like even if I had give 2 hours daily in the last 3 years I would be well prepared by now ) from scratch.  Since it being what I studied in college, I feel with amount of time I have in gate 2020 I can perform good ( aim at &lt;100 rank in gate CSE).  

  

Then I could try to get in a PSU. The pay is good, plus job security. But vacancies in PSU are less for CSE people, and the maximum age limit will render me ineligible in many of them. (I'll be 27 in 2019 ) or pursue Mtech from old IITs, and work for getting a good job, in an upcoming field. 

  

But with how the plans with SSC have gone, I am scared to do anything different now. Also I am afraid of recession coming and becoming jobless a few years down the road in private job.  

  

I am really confused and scared for my future. I feel as if I have lost all the opportunities.  

  

Ideally I would like to remain in my field, i.e computer science. But scared to go the private job way, and not good opportunities in government/psu.  Also I feel I am getting too old and would be a failure down the road soon.  

  

Idk what I'll do. But one thing is for sure, I'll definitely take up any job I get this time and work from there.  

  

&amp;#x200B;

I did read a few posts posted on this topic but it will be a huge help and a very big deal for me if you read all this. If not, TLDR is at the end of the post. 


As you have come this far, let me tell you some background information. I'm 20 years old. I had chosen commerce after my boards exams as I didn't want to take science and hadn't thought about art. After entering commerce, the next obvious step any commerce student takes is chose a professional field. I followed what everyone around me did and chose to do CA without giving a thought to it. The subject I got the least score in my 12th boards was Accounts (which is considered as the most scoring subject). At that time for the first time a doubt lingered my mind that do I or do I not like commerce. But I dismissed it and started preparing for my CPT (Entrance for CA), appeared for it and failed. Here too I failed because I had less marks in accounts. This was the second time I doubted my relationship with the stream I had chosen. Once again I dismissed it. As it was the first time I had experienced academic failure, I decided to give it another shot. I passed the entrance. Side by side, I enrolled myself for FYBCom. And as I had passed CPT, I enrolled for the next exam of my CA journey which was IPCC. At that point I wanted to quit ie. after my CPT results. But I thought, chalo kar lete hey. CPT ho gaya waise IPCC bhi ho jaayega. Side by side, my FYBCom results came too. Lowest score? Accounts. IPCC results came out. Failed in all subjects lowest once again being accounts. I hope you get the pattern. This time once again I thought of quitting. But as my parents really wanted me to try and as I had cleared CPT in the second attempt, I decided to try again. Failed miserably with lowest in accounts. On the other side, I got to SYBCom, gave it's exams got a backlog in accounts. After the second attempt I really wanted to tell my family but I was in intense pressure as I had no clue as to how would they react. I had even joined classes once again. By this time I had wasted around 2.5 lakh rupees in this course and stream. This includes my allowances, travelling, college fees, exam registration fees etc. Due to all this I was feeling guilty and had no courage to tell them. So I enrolled once again for the third attempt of IPCC. But this time, I had decided to finally tell my family. So 2 months prior to the results, I told them. And during this span of 4 years I had developed interest in Psychology. My family supported my decision. I told them I want to do Psychology. As they had no knowledge about it they were a bit skeptical but very supportive. I am really thankful for them being so supportive in such a bad time. We saw a career counsellor and everything. Now I have decided I'm going to do Psychology. I know as a matter of fact that the people enrolling with me will be freshers and younger than me. I want to know what you guys think of my decision and what is the scope of psychology in our country and how much time does it take for one to settle in this field and also was I too late in taking the decision? I really need your help, advice and input. Thank you.

Here is an example illustrated by gap between assumption and truth in USA mindset.

Assumption - ""Oh, I am such a loser. I am not getting a decent job after wasting time and money on college. Now I will live a monotonous life working long hours in McD trying to payback my loan. Then I also have to pay for my high healthcare costs. My friends are buying expensive cars while I can not afford even these basic things. Shame on me. I guess I will die.

Truth - ""The government is a loser. They can easily make education and hospitals affordable but not doing it because of greed. Just because I am not born in a non retarded country like Canada or Germany does not mean I should punish myself. Its not my fault""

Now the same thing is happening in India as well. Examples -

Assumption - ""I am a loser. I scored below 90% in 12th. I will not get admission into a good college. ""

Truth - ""The government is a loser. If they gave their best to setting up maximum number of good universities, I would get an admission in a good one even if I scored above 60% in 12th.

&amp;#x200B;

can't add more links as automod will remove it. you can find me on youtube, fb, twitter etc by name of VCAT Tools

I've made over 100 sales since the launch. Right now i'm trying to get it published in mainstream media like newspapers, news channels etc. They don't seem to be interested in this type of stuff. stuck in marketing stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Even reddit help me in early days. Held some open discussions here and you guys gave lots of advices and criticism (both healthy and bad) and i made some changes in my product. So thanks a lot to you too.

&amp;#x200B;

Really wanted to contribute to this world and to our people by entrepreneurship. Startup life is fucking harsh and really fucks up your mind. Not much sales as products like mine a very rare niche in our country.  But still, you don't invent things everyday. So i took the risk and now it's falling apart. Feels like hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Just want  a casual conversation. AMA if you have any questions. Tips and advises are welcomed.

If you wanna buy pm me or email me prior to purchase for extra discounts ;)

Easiest solution would be to get a static IP from their better IPs.One time i accidently got an IP and gateway in the range of 117.247.x.x and it was heaven,around 50ms ping to southeast asia.Call your ISP and get a static IP in an IP range with good gateway.
Static IP costs some amount and might not be available for all plans.


The second solution would be to use a vpn like wtfast which could route through their servers in India.
I have tested many vpn providers,most of the vpn services which we could use has servers in singapore which gives no improvement as those servers are reached by poor routing of your ISP.

Now here is a solution i found.I have noticed that the southeast asia servers of Google Cloud Platform and Azure Cloud has minimum latency in the range of 40-50ms.This is due to them using peering points in India that routes traffic through their dedicated networks.Heres where Google comes to the rescue.
Google cloud provides 300$ credit and 12 month free use of their platform.Azure provides 1 month and 100$ credit.YOU NEED TO GIVE THEM CREDIT CARD DETAILS TO ACTIVATE TRIAL,DEBIT CARD WONT WORK.

Use this to create a virtual machine in southeast asia region in google compute engine or azure vm.Now ssh into the vm and create an openvpn server.In the end you'll get a config file to connect to the server.Download the openvpn client in your pc and use config file to connect to the vpn server you setup in the cloud.Now your traffic gets routed through your very own private vpn in the google or azure cloud.I have reduced my ping to SEA from 100 to 40-50 this way.There is no lag spike as all traffic gets routed through the premium google network.Also a bonus is all sites gets unblocked ;)
Here is a video tutorial on how to setup your own vpn server in Google Cloud:

Hope this helps many people who suffers lag due to their shitty ISP.",,aficn4,,0,,false,1552636894,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/aficn4/a_solution_to_reduce_ping_in_pubgcsgofortnite_due/,,,false,Non-Political,
1548173560,india,shnshty,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aioceo/we_pulled_a_gandhigiri_on_our_neighbor/,27,13,,,We pulled a Gandhigiri on our Neighbor!,"**TL;DR : Neighbor parked his car in the parking spot that we've been using. Asked him to move his car back to his own spot. He got rude, Implied us bachelors are a menace to the society, Shut the door on us. We put up a note on his car saying ""Get well soon!""**

My roommates and I have been using an empty parking spot in our society, as our designated parking spot was far away from the parking entrance. We had also taken permission of our society's manager for the same. However, the spot adjacent to this parking spot belonged to our neighbor, who always had a thing against us, mostly because we are bachelors. He always complained about the way we parked our bikes in the spot, saying that he couldn't move his car out, as our parked bikes were in his car's way. This was literally not possible, as we never parked our bikes outside of our parking lines and also there was plenty of space in front of every parking spot, for any car to turn in direction it needs to. But we apologized and told him we'll double check before we park our bikes from now onward. He then asked us to park our bikes in certain ways within our parking spot, to which we also complied.

And then, yesterday happened. When we had gone to our jobs, he parked his car diagonally, in such a way that it covered both his parking spot and the adjacent parking spot we've been using.

[Our neighbors car, parked diagonally in 2 parking spots](https://i.redd.it/xxkoip6qhzb21.jpg)

He also left a note on his car's windshield.

[Note our neighbor had put up in his car's windshield](https://i.redd.it/l26zihpshzb21.jpg)

When we came back home to this new affair, we went to talk to him. This was when the 

He said we always parked our bikes outside the parking lines and he had loads of photos as proof.

We asked him to show us these said photos. He said he cant find it.. for now.

He said we had dented his car with our careless parking and he had photos as proof.

We asked him to show us these said photos. He said he cant find it.. for now.

Then he realized something which I think he should have realized long back. He was not the only one who hated bachelors.. the society as a whole did!

So, this happened. He looked down on us and said, ""I don't wanna have any conversation with you. I'll park my car like this so that a lesson can be taught to you guys. Take it up with the management if you like. This conversation is OVER."", and then shut the door on us.

We got furious and called up our landlord. Him being one of the most reasonable individual, heard our concerns, and asked us not heat up this situation anymore, because if it does, the management will favor the house owning family guy, over a bunch of house renting bachelors. He asked us to park our bikes in the other parking spot until this whole fiasco cools down.

We knew we got dealt a bad hand. It was not about the parking spots anymore. Now it was about the little guys standing up the Big Management. It was about the way we bachelors are mistreated and despised in our society (#UsToo). We had to do something about this, but everything we could think of, would have only made the situation worse, for both us and our landlord. We were frustrated, sitting crossed legged in our living room, hands on our head, sad music on TV, wallowing in our despair.

That's when our smart TV starts auto playing Lage Raho Munna Bhai Baapu song.

We had heard our calling. Next thing we know, we had put up our own note, beside our neighbors note, on his car.

[Our note, beside our neighbors note, on our neighbors car](https://i.redd.it/buebnbreizb21.jpg)

So, did we win the battle? Nooo.

The war then? Oh Hell NO.

But moral victory... yayy

1549628367,india,SunXingZhe,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aofzh1/hanuman_in_ancient_china/,4,13,,,Hanuman in Ancient China,"Here is a carving of Hanuman from [Quanzhou City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanzhou), [Fujian Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian), China. Quanzhou was a major port city and home to many local and foreign merchant communities, including Hindus, during the [Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty) and [Yuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty) Dynasties. The carving is believed to have originally been part of the doorframe of a Yuan-period Hindu temple. However, it was discovered in 1947 inside of the Tonghuai gate, a structure built during the following [Ming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty) Dynasty. The fact that this piece was used as common building material may stem from the huge backlash against foreigners at the end of the Yuan. The foreign Mongol rulers of China were known for mistreating natives and favoring people of non-Chinese origin. I've previously read how Arabic tombstones from this time were found to be used as the foundation of a Ming-period wall. Therefore, the aforementioned Hindu temple was no doubt a casualty of the political turmoil preceding the Ming.

&amp;#x200B;

[Hanuman \(Yuan Dynasty\), Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, China](https://i.redd.it/g9um9ddc5cf21.jpg)

Hanuman is portrayed in profile with a crouching gracile form and a flower-like object upheld in his left hand. While one scholar suggests it's a trident (similar to his weapon from the Thai *Ramakien*), another posits it’s an herb, much like that found atop the mountain carried by the monkey god to help heal Rama and Lakshman. The piece is similar to gracile depictions of Hanuman from the Chola Dynasty.

1. Android TV box is simply a TV box running the Android operating system. All mainstream network entities like hotstar , voot, sony liv have their own dedicated app version for android boxes.
2. Most Tvs nowadays are coming with android interface being officially certified by google so it will only get better with time.
3. There are some unofficial apps in grey market which are really reliable for live tv and are totally free meaning your expense will only be about internet plan plus even official apps gives huge discount mostly like few days ago Sony liv 6 month membership was around 50 rs.
4. Hide adult or profanity things. I cannot view Youtube Trending page at all.
5. Support for Android and google home devices. You can use your phone to cast media and google is also bringing support of identifying a person(already present on google home) meaning it will automatically change youtube recommendations according to your preference and your family preference.
6. Before it was only limited to cheap chinese boxes with lack of LTS but now android boxes made by Xiaomi and Nvidia really put them in main market with google project treble.
7. Why I said it is better than firestick is because you are not just limited to bloated amazon interface or lack of usb slot(perfect to use mouse) but you can install different launchers using play store and also easily sideload apps so most of the perks of android. Prime video sideloaded works perfectly.

Google ""chigztech"" to get a detailed chart comparing all android boxes because there are just so many and prefer to use chinese sites (don't worry about customs) to buy it than indian ones as they are way overpriced.

**Please do your own research before finalizing your purchase.

##A few facts and some history

The [Nilgiri District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nilgiris_District) is the western most district in Tamil Nadu, bordering Kerala and Karnataka. 

&amp;nbsp;

The [Nilgiri Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgiri_Mountains) kind of is the meeting point of the Western and Eastern ghats, when viewed in a map(you can see a small curve of mountains), but is completely detached from the Eastern Ghats. Although they are commonly called the Nilgiri ""Hills"", they are actually mountains, with the highest point being [*Doddabetta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doddabetta), which roughly translates to ""Big Hill"" in Kannada and probably [Baduga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badaga_language). This also happens to be the highest peak in the South of India.

&amp;nbsp;

The Nilgiris District consists of 4 major towns and several small villages. The capital is Ooty or Udhagai or Udagamandalam or Ootacamund. Interestingly though, the District was founded in Kotagiri, one of the other major towns. The other two major towns are Coonoor and Gudalur.

The major economic activies include tea plantations and tourism with real estate being the most recent addition.

&amp;nbsp;

##Getting Here

All towns, as a result of being perched upon the hills, requiring a climb by road for the final stretch. The only other way would be by helicopter, and we do have helipads here, but I'm sure most people on reddit would prefer to use other conventional means.


&amp;nbsp;

####Air

That said, the nearest Airport is Coimbatore International Airport, which is about 78 kilometres from Coonoor, 76 kilometres from Kotagiri and 97 kilometres from Ooty. The other means is by helicopter as I mentioned earlier.

&amp;nbsp;

####Rail

Coonoor and Ooty have railway stations but the services are limited to the Nilgiri Mountain Railway. The nearest proper railway station is Mettupalayam, but there is only 1 long distance train and the rest are passenger trains to Coimbatore.

Travellers from Chennai (and other places on the way from Chennai to Coimbatore) can travel directly to Mettupalayam on the [Nilgiri Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgiri_Express)(12671/12672) and thereafter by road to either Coonoor or Kotagiri. If you need more help with this PM me.

Travellers from other places will have to terminate their train journey in Coimbatore and thereafter travel by road.

If you intend to travel to Gudalur, taking a train is not the best option since it has to be access through Ooty on this side and through Kerala or Karnataka on the other.


&amp;nbsp;

**Nilgiri Mountain Railway**

The Nilgiri Mountain Railway runs from Mettupalayam to Ooty via Coonoor. They stop in many of the smaller stations too. I don't have the schedules as of now, but I will post them later. The journey is through a picturesque route, but is quite slow and will take you atleast twice the amount of time it will take you by road. The Mettupalayam - Coonoor route is serviced by coal fired steam locomotives whereas the Coonoor - Ooty route is serviced by a bio-diesel locomotive. There are a lot of tunnels, which make the ride interesting.


&amp;nbsp;

####Road

People from the Northern half of Kerala, near Wayanad will find it easier to reach via Gudalur, while travellers from other parts would find it easier to reach Coimbatore and continue their journey from there.

People from Karnataka will also find it easier to get here through Gudalur as well. Getting to Gudalur will require you to pass through the Bandipur and Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and the roads passing through them are inaccessible to civilian traffic between 9 PM and 6 AM. 

People from Kerala might face this issue too, but there are other routes which are not huge diversions.

For people from Bengaluru, if you intend to avoid the Bandipur - Mudumalai route, you will have to travel to Hosur, from where you will reach Krishnagiri. From Krishnagiri you have the choice of travelling to Salem, or via Mettur. Both routes will take you to Mettupalayam. The Salem route is longer but is entirely 4 lane highways except after Avinashi(close to Mettupalayam) whereas Mettur route is shorter but passes thorough several town and the roads are just 2 lane. The route after Krishnagiri also applies to people travelling from Chennai and other adjacent areas.

There are bus services to every major town and route buses to all villages.

I've travelled only to and from Bangalore by bus and will therefore only write about what I know. I am confining it to over night buses only.

To get to Ooty or Gudalur, the best bus to take would the SETC[TNSTC] or Airavat[KSRTC] which take the Bandipur - Mudumalai route. 4 buses, 2 from each service is exempt from the 9PM to 6PM closure, and there is a chance to spot wildlife(Last time I took the Airavat, people claimed they saw a Tiger, but I was fast asleep and woke up only after all the interesting stuff had happened). To clarify, 4 buses from either side.

Alternately, there are a lot of services that run through Hosur - Krishnagiri route, but I would recommend private services. I have taken the Green Line A/C Sleeper and it's by far the most comfortable bus I've been in, but it comes at a cost of ₹1500(excl. taxes) during the weekends and ₹1000(excl. taxes) on week days. In contrast, the Airavat Club Class, although it is only semi-sleeper, costs ₹808(incl. taxes). There are other cheaper services as well, like Mayura, SRS and KPN, but I have not been in those.

Most Krishnagiri - Hosur route buses will get you to both Coonoor or Ooty. The pick up/drop point in Ooty is the Bus Stand whereas in Coonoor it is near the Outstation Bus Stop, opposite Hyderabad Biriyani House(Somersait Building).


&amp;nbsp;

##Accomodation

For those looking for youth hostels and dormitories in Ooty, there is Zostel with prices ranging from ₹500 to ₹1000. While there are other hostels available, none are as good.
In Coonoor, there is the Backpacker's Burrow which sells rooms at ₹500. This is next to the Hopscotch Restopub, which I will talk about later. There are no other hostel services in Coonoor.

There are plenty of small hotels and lodges but you cannot expect much from there and most are the same in quality.

Ooty has a lot of good midsize hotels, and a quick googling will help you find one. In Coonoor, Hotel Vivek and Venky's are decent midsize hotels, but recently Venky's was in a scandal for allowing prostitution in the premises. There are Blue Hills and Riga but they're pretty run down. 

In Ooty, in the Luxury Hotel segment, you will find Gem Park, Sullivan's Court and Taj. In Coonoor, there is the Gateway Hotel(old, but people still prefer it over everything else) and The Orchid Square Hotel. The Orchid Square was built recently and it quite luxurious and modern. McIver's is another good place with a phenomenal view.

In the resort segment, I would recommend Destiny(lies near the Emarald lake. Huge property, run by the people who run, or used to run, KingsCliff hotel. It's quite beautiful), D-Rock(Near Lambs Rock in Coonoor. Gets quite cold and the view is just stunning) and The Realm Resort(16 kms outside Coonoor. Good place to be away from the bustles of the town.) 

When it comes to home stays, the entirety of the Nilgiris is covered in them and you will not have trouble in finding them.

The Clubs in the Nilgiris with decent accomodation would be Wellington Gymkhana Club, Ooty Gymkhana, Ooty Club, Lawley and Coonoor Club.

Kotagiri doesn't have any good hotel but has plenty of homestays. Gudalur has a few new resorts and a new hotels but I'm not very familiar with them. The new hotel is on the Ooty road, run by the Sasthapuri people from Calicut.


&amp;nbsp;

##Food

**Ooty**

Virtue Bakes has some really good baked stuff. For the sake of history, you could visit Shinkows, which is an old authentic Chinese restaurant, but Pow Ki is not as sharp as he was and the food is crap.

Royal Cafe has some good food, and Quality Restaurant has some good stuff as well. For some more mainstream TN food, you have Kuppana 

Modern stores sells some really good chocolates. The almond chocolates are to die for. King Star is famous for it's fudge. Try the almond fudge, it really good.

For Indian snacks, Prabha sweets is a good place, but we now have A2B as well.

The Culinarium, lies between Ooty and Coonoor, Yellanalli to be exact. It's run by the Pony Needles company, this is the same one as the one in Bangalore. It's a tad expensive but it's worth it.


&amp;nbsp;

**Coonoor**

Coonoor has a lot of specials, stating from the Crown Bakery bread, coconut balls and cakes. National bakery sells good *Varkey*. Indian Bakery *Varkey* is overrated.

Hotel Ramachandra has some really good Chili Chicken and a Mughalai Paratha type dish known as the ""Wellington Special"". It is a Ceylon Parotta, lined with egg and filled with Mutton Keema. Be warned, eating half is humungous a task by itself. 

Hotel Sri Lakshmi is a good vegetarian joint.

Open Kitchen has good pizzas and burgers. 

Cafe Diem(I have been told that their name has been changed; will update soon), has a beautiful view and has some good vegetarian continental food.

Other good restaurants are Quality Restaurant, Green Fields Restaurant, Jharokha, and 

&amp;nbsp;

**Kotagiri**

There are no good food joints in Kotagiri. Nahar has okay vegetarian food and Tandoori Hut has some decent non-veg.

I'm not familiar with food in Gudalur, so I'm going to leave it out.

&amp;nbsp;

##Alcohol

Alcohol is available in any of the TASMAC outlets dotted across the place. For foreign liquor you will have to go the Elite TASMAC in Ooty or some of the bars. The clubs will serve good liquour for very cheap and the bars in the luxury hotels will have some good stuff.

Hopscotch is pretty much the only happening restopub in the entire Nilgiris. They have events most weekend and the crowd is nice and the food is excellent.

&amp;nbsp;

Side Note: Hopscotch, Hotel Vivek, Greenfields restaraunt and Backpackers Burrow are in the same compound. It is owned by Suresh Lakshan Hotels, who also own Sri Lakshmi, Ramachandra and the Realm Resort.

 &amp;nbsp;

##Places of interest

In Ooty there is obviously the Botanical Garden, the Rose Garden, the Arboretum, Karnataka Park etc. In Coonoor there is the Sims Park and Katteri Park. But all these places are good to visit only when it is full blossom. So visit after mid March, until the end of June for an optimal experience.

The Doddabetta Peak in Ooty, Lambs Rock and Dolphin's Nose in Coonoor as well the Kodanad View Point outside Kotagiri are prominent viewpoints.

A trek to the Droog or Rangaswamy Peak is recommended.

Boating is available at the Pykara Dam, Boat House in Ooty and in Sims Park and the Wellington Lake in Coonoor.

The Boat House also has a lot of other rides which may interest you and near the Boat House, you have Thunder World, which is a park run by LA Group(Black Thunder, Jenny's Club etc). It has quite a few rides and a Dinosaur attraction, which is quite nice especially for kids.

In the Summer there are horse races at the Ooty Race Course. (I have never been to one so far, but intend to soon)

While in Ooty, you can also visit the ""Miles"", which are beautiful spaces with a lot of tourist movement. I, personally do not see anything attractive about these places, but a lot of movies were shot here.

The Ketti Valley is a beautiful place to visit, and the drive is just amazing. Take the Lovedale route, it's really beautiful.

Kundah, is one of the most beautiful places in the Hills. It is slightly remote but it is worth it. Visit the Pillur dam while your here. You could drive to the gates of Korakundah tea factory(civilians are not allowed inside), the drive is long but extremely beautiful. There are a few other areas nearby(I'm not able to recall the names), which are worth visiting.

The Ooty Gymkhana and Wellington Gymkhana have 18 hole golf courses while Highfield in Coonoor has a 9 hole course.

There are occasional cricket tournaments that take place as well.

&amp;nbsp;

#####The [Neela Kurinji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strobilanthes_kunthianus) is in bloom this year. It blooms only once in 12 years. The moutainside covered in purple is a sight to behold.

EDIT: This might be just in pockets since there was a bloom last year as well. I shall update this info soon.

Hope you have a wonderful time!

If you don't, then, you're living under a rock. Recently, there's been demands to have the game banned because of ""violence"" and addiction. Honestly, I feel that the people who want the game banned aren't thinking straight.

Say, the game is banned. Who's gonna stop another game like this from coming up in the market? You're scared of your kids playing a game all day? What about other kinds of addiction? Like tobacco and alcohol. Instead of having the game banned, learn to exercise self-control. If you're letting something as irrelevant as a video game like this affect your life, then you're not gonna get anywhere in life. For parents, teach your kids to exercise self-control. If you take away their gadgets and whatnot and keep your kids in a protective shell till their schooling is done, they're gonna have a tough time in college. This is just the tip of the iceberg.

Don't get me started on the ""violence"" of this game. Ever heard of Team Fortress 2? Or GTA 5? Or Doom? Or Mortal Kombat? Or even Injustice? This is nothing compared to the violence shown in those games.

If our country ends up banning this game, then unfortunately, it's not accepting that our youth are ready to face the outside world yet, and that is very disappointing",,amrg4d,,0,,false,1553008393,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/amrg4d/why_the_pubg_ban_makes_no_sense/,,,false,Non-Political,

Though I'm a Swiggy user and never wanted to open an account on Zomato but today I decided to give them a chance and ordered via the Paytm app. 

Keep in mind that Paytm doesn't need a  Zomato account, it'll place an order on Zomato on behalf of you. There's no support available and you have to call Zomato  in case anything goes wrong. 

I ordered and found out there's no live tracking available like swiggy, the Paytm app just shows whether my food is cooking or not and when it's out for delivery. 

My order reached on time and again I noticed there's no way to rate a delivery boy. That delivery boy didn't know about Paytm-Zomato tieup and was kinda sad knowing I wasn't able to rate him. :( 

So tl;dr: Do not use Paytm app to order. Create an account on Zomato directly and order from their app to get live tracking and more detailed information about your food delivery. 

There was nothing wrong with my delivery and I was really impressed to see that guy delivered my food efficiently without even calling me. It was just sad that I wasn't able to rate him. I wonder how many Zomato boys are going miss out on incentives for ratings if people order from Paytm.

The Haryana government, in all its wisdom, has decided to ban the consumable that is central to tobacco de-addiction therapy.

I was advised by my regular chemist to drive across the border to Delhi and buy the gums there. I decided that was worth doing for my friend, but I decided to check with a few more chemists before committing myself to the half an hour long drive. I mean, this is Gurgaon we are talking about- some of the chemists are bound to stock illegal drugs for sure.

I want to donate some money to a charity but I dont have any idea what is a good place to donate to. People have discouraged me to donate to large organizations such as CRY because a small fraction of a donation actually reaches the people in need (I am not sure about this).

Perhaps I am dumb but this is what the news reports led me to believe: you get up to 100 free channels for a network capacity fee of Rs.130. Whatever pay channels you add, you have to pay extra. This is not the whole truth!

You have to pay a network fee for ALL channels you choose (free and pay), not just the first 100 free ones. So suppose you choose 100 free channels and 23 pay channels. Suppose the 23 pay channels cost an extra Rs.50. So you would think your total would be Rs.130 + 50 (I am omitting GST for sake of simplicity). No, it will be more, because your TOTAL channel count has exceeded 100. So you have to pay Rs.130 for the first 100 channels, Rs.50 for the pay channels AND the network fee for the additional 23 channels (Rs.20).

Network fee for additional channels (over the basic 100 channels) is Rs.20 per blocks of 25 channels. Network fee applies for both free and pay channels.

The kicker is that HD channels count as two channels each for calculating the total number of channels for calculating the network capacity fee.

Another example: you have 10 free channels and 20 pay channels (all HD) which cost Rs.100. In this case, total number of channels is 10 + 20 x 2 = 50. Since this is less than 100, the network fee will be Rs.130. You will pay a total of Rs.130 + 100 = Rs. 230 (again, GST omitted).",,ajz871,,0,,false,1552712344,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/ajz871/til_the_trai_basic_rs130_fee_for_100_channels_is/,,,false,Non-Political,

1550266459,india,acemachine26,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ar1kgn/a_housemaids_colony_my_fathers_short_story_about/,3,15,,,"A Housemaid's Colony: My father's short story about his time working in Andhra, education at the grassroots level and the ups and downs of Indian life in general","In RS Rao Nagar, Secunderabad, which is a part of Andhra Pradesh in India, there lies a place called ECIL colony. There are many colonies across the breadth and length of India. So what is so special about this colony? You must be wondering! As usual this was started by one of the quasi-government companies for the convenience of its engineers and senior managers, who were the cream of the elite in the society. Plots were allotted to individual employees and they made houses according to their will and capabilities, sometimes beyond that also.   
Mr.Ram, one of the very first home owners in that colony, who is still staying in his house for most part of the year introduced my good friend and colleague Vishnu, to this place and helped us get a portion of a palatial two storied villa, on rent. He was kind enough to drive us around and show some beautiful places not far from our residence   
I myself and Vishnu, were forced bachelors in Secunderabad as our families were settled in Bangalore. Our fortnightly commute to Bangalore, in Kachiguda express or Gareebrath trains kept us sane, in that country side.  
In the middle of the day, when we checked in to our house everything looked grand and green. We had a housemaid attached house; or it would be right to say we had a housemaid and her family staying at an outhouse, in our compound. She herself, her husband and two kids stay in and look after the house and its garden. So, we were lucky to get her services to maintain our portion of the house also neat and clean.  
The monotonous job routine was made bearable by the entertainment of bachelor cooking and discussions about the stupidity of outdated bosses who still think, bossing is all about putting hurdles on the way of progress of their subordinates. In between Anchamma (our maid) brought her LP School kids for tuition, to us. Although I used to be a professor of Marketing for MBA students, once up on a time, I didn’t feel my ego hurt, to teach those kids. The 6-year-old boy and his 4-year-old sister used to share a small piece of broken pencil and wait patiently for their turns to write. Although I know about poverty and how millions suffer in our homeland, working many years in MNCs abroad, maybe I lost touch with grassroots level reality. It came as a shock to me. I went with my friend and bought some books, pencils, eraser and slates for the kids. Seeing the happiness in their eyes, made me feel like, I won an Oscar. Every evening when we reach home, from job, both kids will be waiting at the door. The boy will salute me, as if we are in the army and the little’ girl will be lurking behind, with a shy smile. We used to share little snacks with those kids, sometimes. I can still see the smiles on their innocent faces, when we keep the food items on their little palms. May be that motivated them to look forward to their study times.

The housemaid’s husband was a smart looking tall man. He is very quiet and she used to order him around and made him do errands around the house. He loved his wife and kids and obeyed all her orders, as if she is his mother. In the evenings he used to come drunk and some times make a scene. She scolds him and to vent her anger sometimes beat her children. In the mornings when she come to clean our house, we used to tell her, please don’t beat the kids; they are too small. They have no one else, but you to protect them. Her eyes well up with tears and she says, we have no money and whatever I save he spent on drinks; how else can I show my anger?   
Most mornings, before starting to the factory, me and Vishnu will do yoga, on the vast balcony or I will go to gym, with my junior colleague Venkat, who was staying nearby. I was always a fitness freak. Venkat is the only one among my friends, who is more obsessed than me, about fitness. I am glad to let you know that, he has graduated in to an Ironman, triathlon enthusiast. Every evening Vishnu will put on his tape recorder, with old Hindi songs and sing along. That was our major entertainment. I used to strum on my old guitar, when I am alone. Although, I love the instrument and very passionate about all types of music, I was never good at it, to play in front of anyone.   
Mr.Ram, our well-wisher, used to drop in sometimes and give us good advises. In the third week of the month he dropped in, late evening and asked us, where do we sleep. We told him, that this job we are considering as a stopgap arrangement and do not want to do any long-term investments there. Hence, we just had our beds and some mats. He told, no, no, that’s not good. You should have a cot at least. I have some good quality wooden cots at home. You can take that; we are not using them anyway. Its solid teak wood etc. We told him, we do not need cots. If we need, we will buy later. But he insisted and we couldn’t say no to his loving persuasion. Thus, we both got a cot each, from him. He even helped us to carry them to our home. We were surprised that, still there are some good human beings.  
On 30th of the month, we got our salaries, did some grocery shopping, had a discounted dinner at Subway, as they had half price offer for Paneer sub. on Mondays. When we reached home, Mr.Ram was standing at the gate, with a beaming face. He commented, it looks like my new neighbours got their salaries today. We happily confirmed that and invited him for a cup of tea.  
During our tea, he told, “Young men (although we were not that young), you can pay me for the cots, you bought from me; anyway, you got your salaries now.  
We looked at each other, in dis-belief. Hesitantly Vishnu asked him, “Sir, how much we have to pay you? we do not have a problem, we were going to ask you”. He said, “You can pay me well; they are very good wood. New ones will cost a fortune. Pay me Rs.4000/- each”. We had shock of our lives; we never asked him for that. He only insisted and gave us, as if it’s a free gift. It’s of course useful. But such an old piece should cost only a small percentage of what he asked. Anyway, we paid him what he asked. But we knew well, that we were taken for a ride, very artistically.

On Sunday mornings Vishnu will make breakfast, after yoga. Mostly it will be Upma and when the water starts boiling, he will shout, “Anjamma ……..curry leaves”. The maid will pluck fresh curry leaves, from her kitchen garden and come running or send it with one of the kids.   
Our neighbouring house was very noisy on weekends. The housemaid there and her husband usually sleep in the small room outside the kitchen. As we are staying on the first floor, we can see all the happenings around. And in the weekends their friends (maids and their husbands from nearby houses) gather there and they takeover the house completely. Drinking and all types of fun and frolicking takes place.  
Once we saw the maid and her husband of our neighbouring house was fighting with each other. The man was shouting at his wife, “Why the hell the old goose and the fat pig coming back, to disturb us? Now I have to find a place to stay for my nephew.  
The lady was pacifying him saying, “Do we have a choice? Its their house. They will be here only for a couple of months. Then they will go back. We will adjust somehow.” We were wondering, what is happening and didn’t had a clue, what they are talking about.

Eventually we realized that most of the houses are occupied by housemaids and their families. The owners of the house are old people, who are in Germany, US or Australia. They were all highly placed managers, who spent most of their lives savings to make their kids Engineers and doctors, who went to universities abroad and eventually settled at their places of job. The parents were asked to join them for deliveries of their daughters or daughters in law and to look after their kids. Once in a while when the parents couldn’t stand the hard work and abuse or crave for some privacy and to see their friends and relatives back home, they are sent on parole. At that time only the houses are occupied by the real owners. Most of the occupants are care takers and when they stay for longer duration, they assume that they own the houses and expect that the owners never will come back. If they ever comeback, it becomes a nuisance for them.   
I remember, during our Gulf days, many friends, who stayed as bachelors for different reasons, used to say sadly, we all are vending machines. We have to keep sending money to our wife and kids. We will starve and save all the money and buy all sorts of gifts and carry home, when we get leave. The lucky ones go once a year and the not so lucky ones go once in 3 or 4 years.  
Wife and children love their visits and enjoy the gifts and funds transfer. But if they overstay, everyone starts murmuring, when will he go back? What a headache, wife cannot go shopping with friends, children cannot come home late. Frequent movies and trips with friends are restricted. Its not that they don’t love him; but they are used to the freedom and the entertainments that the monthly funds transfer bring. But this loving husband/father is outdated and has old school values. Its difficult to stand that for longer.  
May be the homemade and family are grateful that they got the job and the security that comes with it. But the freedom that they enjoyed in the absence has gone to their heads and they took it as a right. And the poor house owners who paid their salaries without fail became a nuisance. Everyone thinks about own happiness and freedom and don’t have the inclination or time, to think about the ones, who’s efforts they are enjoying.

The last news I got about our Secunderabad neighbourhood was that, Mr.Ram, who arranged the accommodation for us was discarded by his kids, who were settled abroad and is now languishing in an old age home, somewhere. His wife was lucky to die before that. What a tragic end to a highly educated individual, who was a responsible father, husband and a good human being. India and Indians lost many things, in the so-called progress and quest to copy the Westerners. But the most tragic loss is the loss in values of family and social relationships. I personally feel, we copied only the negative aspects of western life.  
I sometimes wonder, what those two little kids grew to become. Hope they made it big in their lives. Maybe I should go back and see them one day. The biggest take away from my Hyderabad sojourn is friendship with two great human beings, Vishnu and Venkat, which I hope, will last till my last days.  
How many people pass through our lives, at different phases; some of them leaves a mark in our hearts, some remain as a lingering pain, some as a pleasant memory.

1553971390,india,sapiosexual_of_quora,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b7ehuj/songs_from_50s/,14,15,,,Songs from 50s.,"Being a musician myself, I have noticed that there are very few posts on this sub related to Hindi music. So I have decided to come up with a list of lesser known songs from 50s.

Music in 50s shaped music of 60s, which according to me is the golden period of Hindi music. Music industry was dominated by Shankar-Jaikishan, SD Burman, OP Nayyar and Naushad as music directors while Mukesh was the most popular singer of that era. 50s marked the emergence of various singers like Manna Dey, Mohd. Rafi, Hemant Kumar, Talat Mehmood and Mahendra Kapoor who all later on established themselves in Hindi Music industry. C.I.D, Kala Paani, Paying Guest (Dev Anand); Boot Polish, Awara, Chori Chori, Shree 420, Anaari (Raj Kapoor); Basant Bahar, Baiju Bawara (Bharat Bhushan); Naya Daur, Aan, Amar, Devdas (Dileep Kumar) etc were some popular movies of that time. 

Now before we go to the list, let me clarify that this list comprises of lesser known songs therefore it excludes songs from Awaara, Anaari and various other movies which I believe are still widely popular.

The list goes like this:

 1) Baiju Bawra: This movie is the epitome of religious brotherhood in India. While the dialogues were written by Zia Sarhadi, lyrics by Shakeel Badayuni, Music by Naushad and singers were Mohd. Rafi, Ustad Amir Khan, Shamshad Begum and others as well; the movie was loosely based on the Bhakti Movement. For me, this is the greatest piece of music bollywood has ever offered. Mohd. Rafi became a celebrity overnight and Naushad was hailed as the ""King of Classical Music in Indian Cinemas"". You may have come across songs like O Duniya ke Rakhwale (https://youtu.be/ReFDB8cexLg) and Man Tarpat Hari Darshan (https://youtu.be/tz7C0MEaMfQ) but I am going to share some lesser known songs of this movie.

- Tu Ganga ki Mauj (https://youtu.be/lCluwNrOtR4): Sung by Mohammed Rafi. Here ""Mauj"" is for waves of river Ganga.

- Tori Jai Jai Kartar(https://youtu.be/HYpCJ8yE7z0): Came across this song when I was on a trip to Gwalior Fort where it was being played during the Light and Sound show. Being a classical music lover, I got hooked up with this song pretty quickly. Sung by Ustad Amir Khan and is based on Raag Puriya Dhanashree. 

- Aaj Gawat Man Mero (https://youtu.be/SsxwXPPIaxU): A ""Jugalbandi"" by Pandit DV Paluskar (as Baiju) and Ustad Amir Khan (as Tansen). It's like a mediaeval rap battle where the winner will be the one who melts the Marble slab with his voice. Baiju (Pandit Paluskar) eventually wins in the movie. This song is based on Raag Deshi.

2) Basant Bahar: I would recommend the whole soundtrack. The songs in this movie became bhajans during that time and are still considered as one of the best works of Shankar-Jaikishan. After the release of Baiju Bawra, people claimed that Naushad is the king of Classical music in Indian cinema. This pissed S-J off and then they decided to take up Basant Bahar as a challenge. Although the music is one of the all time great but didn't win even a single award. If you want to save some of your time then I've given links of the songs from this movie.

-Ketaki Gulab (https://youtu.be/FseICrhx-W0): This song surely is a treat for Indian Classical Music lovers which I am afraid there aren't many on this sub. Here is an amazing story related to Manna Dey who refused to sing/compete with Bharat Ratna Pandit Bhimsen Joshi out of respect.(https://www.cinestaan.com/articles/2018/feb/4/10846/why-manna-dey-refused-to-sing-with-bhimsen-joshi-ndash-birth-anniversary-special)

- Bhay Bhanjana (https://youtu.be/nq39-fhY3KU): This song of that era is bhajan of today. Based on Raag Miyan Malhar, it is considered as one of the greatest song of Manna Dey. 

- Duniya na Bhaye (https://youtu.be/ZQHUzQ7QwmU): Sung by Mohammed Rafi and based on Raag Miyan ki Todi. I have no words for this song. A lyrical and musical masterpiece. Although Mohd. Rafi's songs from 60s and 70s are cherished more but the 50s remains his pinnacle when he was sought after by every music director for his versatility. I feel sorry that people now have forgotten this gem. So here is my try, to revive this song.

- Badi der Bhayi (https://youtu.be/FW547V_wmyc): Simple lyrics and a great vocal range. I believe only Mohd. Rafi can sing this song with such ease.

3) Aadha hai Chandrama (https://youtu.be/aasw1WDNhgY): Debut song from Mahendra Kapoor and quite a way to do that. I don't have any idea who the actors in this song are but it sure is a gem.

4) Aaja re Pardesi (https://youtu.be/Mm21SSgUHe8): Lata Mangeshkar's voice will leave you spellbound.

5) Aey Dil Mujhe Bata De (https://youtu.be/hKcaNydkNMg): Sung by Geeta Dutt. It is one of the most popular song of 50s and first of the many hits of music director Madan Mohan. 

6) Bholi Surat Dil Ke Khote (https://youtu.be/Cb2ef3cUrKU): A song from movie Albela. Music director C Ramchander himself sang this song along with Lata Mangeshkar.

7) Hum Bekhudi me Tum Ko Pukaare (https://youtu.be/7dtSD6hI-yI): You must have heard other songs of  ""Kala Pani"" like Accha Jee Mai Haari but this one steals the show for me. Sung by Mohd. Rafi and music by RD Burman. Music is minimal in this song.

8)  Lapak Jhapak Tu Aa Re Badarwa (https://youtu.be/yDr9g_x2nYk): Song from movie Boot Polish based on Raag Malhar (Raag of Rain) sung by the Legendary Manna Dey. Here is an interesting read on this song- (http://www.cinemasangeet.com/hindi-film-music/down-melody-lane/lapak-jhapak-tu-kaare-badarawa.html)

9) Tumsa Nahin Dekha (https://youtu.be/Ezpvc3lNLK0): Music of OP Nayyar had a special distinction. If there is a sound of horse taps in the song then it most probably will be OP Nayyar's song. Sung by Mohd. Rafi and depicted on Shammi Kapoor, this song is like honey for ears.

10) Yeh Raat Yeh Chandni (https://youtu.be/4GfUK9Urb6I): Music by SD Burman and sung by Hemant Kumar. Enjoy this song.

As a recruiter how do you screen resumes? When you get 1000 application, how do you pick the 25/30 most relevant profiles. Is it random or done by a program or mostly referral?

It would be nice to share tips for job seekers, in terms of how one can improve their visibility

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for a job( in IT) and I'm not able to figure the whole scene out. How does one crack it?

* I've tried reaching out to recruiters on linkedIn - with no revert
* I apply to Naukri job, as well as send my application personally to their email id.
* Sometime tweak my resume to match the JD, but hardly get any positive response.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you could answer these below question honestly please

1. Do career-gaps have a huge negative impact  on the application. Would you prefer not to hire people with career gaps?
2. When you hire for your client or C2H (contract to Hire), do you tell them honestly about the project duration? Most of my friends say that recruiters often say a project is long-term but in  reality it's just 6-8 months thing.
3. Is it normal to schedule interview without sharing the JD? I gave an interview with a good IT company and all I was told was that the position is for ""Data Science with Python"", the HR said she doesn't have a JD. 
4. Twice I got call from 2 different 3rd part recruiters, who source candidates for these big MNCs, my interview got scheduled and then on the interview day it got cancelled. The reason given on both the occasions roughly were ""*Unfortunately, the hiring panel has got some important meeting, your interview has been cancelled for today. We will let you know once we get the confirmation*"". Does this mean, that my application got rejected at the last moment, and the third party HR doesn;t want to give the bad news. This varies from person to person, but as an HR do you do similar things to somehow pacify the candidate and not contact them ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopeful of getting some good insights. The amount of positivity I see recruiters show on LinkedIn is different in real world(my experience - not with the same person but the overall hiring process).

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Just to clear  my stand - I understand it's tough both for HRs and a job seekers, both have their own perspective. I just want to understand if there's anything that I'm doing wrong.",,b6vmfx,,0,,false,1560302599,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b6vmfx/indian_reddit_users_who_are_working_as_hiring/,,,false,Non-Political,

Basically, /u/bluefunkd and I are planning a meet for techies and entrepreneurs.

#WHY

I'm sure you have an idea for a product or start-up you'd like to share. We want to dedicate a time and place where this can be made possible because as much as I love Internet forums, nothing beats IRL interaction.

And yes, I know there are plenty of other similar gatherings out there that you have probably been to. We want to keep this non-commercial. No one is profiting off your time. We're just a bunch of wannabe entrepreneurs looking for others like us.

#WHAT

The goal of the meet is straightforward: Facilitate conversations between like-minded individuals towards building successful products.

So far, we have ideas for social initiatives, education, games, blockchain applications, etc. and we’d like to share these thoughts with other people who want to contribute.

#HOW

The meet will be a structured discussion centred around discussing, building, and tearing down ideas. We'll be presenting a few ideas and asking you to do the same. Bring a towel. This will get serious.

There will be minimal time given to miscellaneous chit-chat, and there will be no hanging out. Period. We can grab a beer later if you like. :)

So to make this an engaging experience for everyone involved, I will be strictly inviting people who are completely serious about this topic and hence will only replying via PM. However, please free to comment if you have questions.

#WHERE

We’ve chosen Bangalore as the venue for now but may conduct a meet in other metros if we get a decent response.

For now, I’m all ears.",,ac7sgd,,0,,false,1552581174,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/ac7sgd/announcing_yet_another_meetup_but_this_is_a/,,,false,Non-Political,

Full disclosure: I'm a fan of hip-hop, and I've been super into Divine for years now. I'd been looking forward to watching this movie ever since the first trailer dropped, they've fucking KILLED it. And not just the bits you'd expect them to get right, the music is definitely on point, but so is the interpersonal stuff. Spoilers ahead so be careful- there's this scene where Ranveer Singh's Murad (who's a poor college student from Dharavi forced to work as a driver for a rich family when his father gets injured) is drawn to the rap music playing some club, he walks towards it and I could feel it coming, the bouncer sees him and motions to him to fuck off. It's just so welll done, no words were spoken. Alia's character was a bit disconcerting: she's a bit batshit crazy and I felt they didn't handle it with as much nuance as they could've. There's tons of cameos from people like Divine and Ankur Trivedi and Raja Kumari. They've subtely acknowledged the gap between the older generation and the newer one, where people not into rap would find it a tad odd, and it's just so well done. 

Go watch it, it's worth seeing. ",,aqhr36,,0,,false,1553075645,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/aqhr36/just_came_back_from_gully_boy/,,,false,Non-Political,

To make things worse, I live in NCR region - the most polluted city in the world.

It scares me that I would have to spend my the rest of my life with this. I don't think I am brave enough to do that. Sometimes I consider suicide as a viable option.

can't add links as automod will remove it. you can find me on youtube, fb, twitter etc by name of VCAT Tools. Links are in the comments

I've made over 100 sales since the launch. Right now i'm trying to get it published in mainstream media like newspapers, news channels etc. They don't seem to be interested in this type of stuff. stuck in marketing stuff.

Even reddit help me in early days. Held some open discussions here and you guys gave lots of advices and criticism (both healthy and bad) and i made some changes in my product. So thanks a lot to you too.

Really wanted to contribute to this world and to our people by entrepreneurship. Startup life is fucking harsh and really fucks up your mind. Not much sales as products like mine a very rare niche in our country. But still, you don't invent things everyday. So i took the risk and now it's falling apart. Feels like hell.

Just want a casual conversation. AMA if you have any questions. Tips and advises are welcomed.

Do not buy Poco F1,"TL:DR : bought Poco F1 from flipkart, received a defective phone both Flipkart and Xiaomi refuses to acknowledge the problem. Stuck with defective phone.

So I bought Poco F1 during republic day sale from Flipkart.

* I received a phone with severe screen bleeding. Asked for an exchange(biggest mistake). Technician visited home, First he refused to acknowledge that there is an issue and he says its fairly common and its not an issue, but after protesting he agreed and I got an exchange.

* Now the exchanged phone has the same problem. same technician comes home (I was not at home) checks device  and said no issues and rejected refund.

* I protest and one more technician visit scheduled but this guy acknowledges the problem and he said there is an issue and he will update accordingly. To my surprise I get an SMS after 2 hours that  my refund is rejected and there is no issue with the phone. So I called the techinician on why lied he says that so called backend team felt that there is no issue with the phone after looking at pictures. 

I angrily called flipkart customer care and they forward the ticket to some team. They call me back and asked me to visit an MI service center and get a DOA certificate if I want a refund. I protested but I visited the service center, the technician in service center says they wont provide DOA certificates for phones bought on Flipkart(Moreover he says this common for poco phones and its not an issue). So I called Xiaomi customer care and they asked me send out an email with pictures. After calling them again they confirm that they can't provide DOA for phone bought on Flipkart(I dont know why they wanted me to send an email in the first place) and more over they say they don't see problem with the phone.

I emailed the same to flipkart and haven't received a response yet and its close to 1 week since the phone is sitting with me. Phone in discussion (https://imgur.com/a/Ns3QEiP) The picture doesn't even capture the intensity of bleeding. What I find annoying is everyone is lying and failing to acknowledge the problem. I wasted multiple hours on this defective phone. **The jeeves technician, flipkart backend team, mi service center technician, mi customer care everyone is LIAR.**

I am stuck with a defective phone now and decided to never buy from Xiaomi and Flipkart. End of my sad rant.


**Update**: Flipkart called me today and some how agreed to refund after telling them my experience with xiaomi service center. Waiting for the phone to be picked up. 


Funny thing when I posted the pic on Twitter tagging poco India, their customer care guy called me and told me that it is a perfectly looking phone and they can't do anything about it and all poco phones are like this. So folks that's the official stance of Xiaomi on this issue, that its perfectly normal for them to call defective phones as normal.


I wonder how many poco users stuck with defective phone. ",,an1oib,,0,,false,1553013210,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/an1oib/bad_experience_with_xiaomi_and_flipkartnp_do_not/,,,false,Non-Political,

We went to the same undergraduate college - were part of the same political organization and even contested in the university union elections.

We pretty much had a similar line of argument on most human rights issues. Post his OTA training, he has shifted his line a bit but still seems more or less seems to follow the liberal line for arguing political issues. I took a completely different career route and stayed in academia. Over a period of time differences in opinions were bound to happen due to the spheres of our work. Some did but we still agree on very basic issues - like he would unequivocally condemn how Kashmiri's are getting beaten up in parts of India. On the flip side, he would again support demonetization.

While talking to him though, I realized he has not changed as a person but has exposure to a different perspective through the army, that I do not understand. On the flip side, I have some experiences through working with rural communities and studying abroad, that he doesn't quite get. I would have assumed in this very polarized political environment, we would fall apart. This happened with most of my school friends - so I assumed this was inevitable. However, in this case this did not happen and I was wondering if it had something to do with our college camaraderie or  the fact that he made me realize that there are certain things within the defense forces that I as a civilian wouldn't understand.

This brought me to the question of IDF and how they have mandatory service. IDF is probably revered for the wrong reasons in India but to be fair to them they are pretty inclusive as a fighting force. Doesn't matter if you are overweight, they will either find a way to train you or find something that you can contribute to positively.

Would such a policy work in India? Maybe, we as citizens have a better understanding of what goes down in defense. For starters, army generals on TV channels cannot take a moral high ground for having served and many engineers might actually be saved from engineering. But on a more serious note, it would probably dilute some of the immense pressure that class 12 school children are faced with to clear medical or engineering. Moreover serving with different people across class, caste and gender divides might actually build an empathetic society where we could look beyond just our own self-interests.

I am not making this argument from a Nationalist point of view but from lens of a social assimilation of sorts.

Was just wondering what you guys think about this!

Have been trying to reach Ola but it’s just not possible. The support section gives a number that just says use the number provided in the apps support section. That’s exactly what I am doing (screenshot attached). There is no direct number to reach them. I did find some numbers online but either the automated system greets me and call get disconnected automatically or someone actually picks up and hangs up within 2 seconds. 

Well what if this was more serious, like a medical emergency or something. To try this, I selected a different reason, ‘safety’ in support section. There was a direct number but that too was getting hung up automatically. And it’s not my phone issue I tried another phone. 

Seriously shitty experience.

Not sure if it's changed, but getting it in India is fairly rare - restricted to a few states only (like Telangana apparently).

Why does this matter? If you've been bit - or even been licked on an open wound or the face - by a rabid animal (usually dogs, but also bats and others) then you are at risk of catching rabies. The severity of the exposure determines what must be done next, as well as whether you've been vaccinated before:

A severe exposure requires both a vaccine and a RIG dose near the area affected. The shortage means that you might have to go round the country to search for a shot, and these can cost up to 20-30,000 (in addition to the vaccine)! It becomes a race against the clock (even though rabies is slow moving). This happened in the past with someone who was bitten and scratched by a monkey (according to a news report), and they described the experience of finding treatment worse than being bitten!

OTOH if you are already vaccinated, you don't need the RIG, just the vaccines are enough. This is significantly cheaper - each vaccine is about 350-500 and is required 4-5 times for a total of ~2500, one-tenth of just the RIG cost, and is available in almost every hospital in the country.

And no, it hasn't been the 21-shot vaccine for quite a while now. This is for about 5 times and is not much more painful than any other vaccine given in the arm. The peace of mind alone is worth it, if nothing else.

The only downside is that all the shots aren't given at once - you have to keep coming back each time and not many people would have the time for that and requires planning (although missing the deadlines by a day or two is far better than not taking it at all)",,abe9l1,,0,,false,1552567359,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/abe9l1/np_psa_get_vaccinated_for_rabies_if_you_can/,,,false,Non-Political,

I created a fake profile on Couchsurfing of a pretty foreigner girl who creates India trip and the response I got was shocking,"In just 5 days, I got more than 100 requests from all over the country even when I created trip of one city. 99% requests were from men. Just 1 girl.  Every guy said he wants me to show the culture of India. One guy who once rejected my request because I was a middle clas Indian guy was super desperate towards this my fake profile.

Next day I  created fake profile of an Indian guy and I got no response.

The way India is using Couchsurfing is pathetic and I request you people to host everyone because travelling is not a luxury. Its one of the most beautiful things that connects people with simple things like nature and other humans. Please host 40% girls, 35% foreigner males and 25 % Indian males but do not reject Indian males all together.

Normally I give a 10 Rs note whenever some one asks, today I did not have the change and gave him a Rs. 5 coin. He took the coin, waited a bit for me to give some more money, and when I started moving away from there, he called me saying ""I will not even get a tea for 5 rs"" and handed over the coin back to me.

So, around six years back I had issues with depression was under medication and all, but I stopped going to my Psychiatrist and joined a engineering college thinking I am alright and things will eventually turn out fine. 

Time passed on, I even made some friends but that part about me which craved a connection was never satisfied, I always felt like an oddity, someone who cannot relate to anyone, someone whom people don't want around, I even let people use me by helping them too much, by letting them make fun of me, and then college finished and I got a job, but I was never mentally satisfied in my life since I was diagnosed with depression. 

It's like depression broke my entire mental state, It made me believe in the meaninglessness of everything, made me lazy, destroyed my fears of things that can completely destroy my life, made me an social outcast and I have never been able to grow out of that personality. 

I think no one really knows me, no one in my family knows me except for maybe one person, no friends, no one. I became bad at connecting with people and sort of started accepting my loneliness but nowadays it gets really tough sometimes because of family issues, life in general and I feel like I have made no progress in my life ever, I have just wasted it away. 

You see, that feeling that you are worthless, but I am trying to change my lifestyle, my attitude towards life, towards myself and be a better version of myself. 

Now you can say why am I writing all this stuff up here, the reason is because I need some sort of support in my life, I am completely broken from inside tbh, and it will take some time and some support to grow again. I just needed to put some things out, because I cannot talk about this to anyone in my life. Not to my family, not to anyone of my friends, I am a lonely fuck. 

Thank You, if you read it all. :)",,aouxlb,,0,,false,1553045841,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/aouxlb/i_am_lonely_in_life_how_to_deal_with_it/,,,false,Non-Political,

I  gave them by number and they told me I can only get it done between Feb  6th and 11th since my bill will be generated then. I asked them if I  could pay the outstanding amount and begin the migration process - they  said no.

I left the store and pinged Airtel on Twitter. They  called me and told me I can go to the store and apply for the conversion  by just paying the outstanding bill. So, on 29th January, I visited the  same store again and this time, my request was magically accepted after  paying the outstanding ₹230. I also submitted all the documents  mentioned by [enterprise@in.airtel.com](mailto:enterprise@in.airtel.com) for the migration:

1. NOC from the company
2. Identity Proof (Aadhaar)
3. Address Proof (Aadhaar)
4. 1 Passport Sized photograph

I was told the migration would take 3 working days. So the conversion should have been completed on 2nd February, 2019.

But  even after 3rd February, 2019, the migration had not been completed. I  called the Customer Care who assured me it will be completed within 18  hours after taking the new SIM number. This was important since I was  travelling on 3rd and 4th.

3rd February, 2019 - my postpaid SIM  is deactivated. I insert the prepaid SIM and see no signal reception. So  - my number was completely unreachable.  Anyway, I call customer care who tell me the documents have not  been updated and I need to visit the same store again.  I tell them I  cannot do so since I am travelling and ask them to communicate with the  store since I have done all I need to do. They hung up on my by saying  ""Thank you for calling Airtel"".

&amp;#x200B;

Why on earth should Airtel deactivate the Postpaid number if the prepaid documents have not been updated?

4th February. I send e-mails,  send Tweets and DM them on Twitter urging them to take action. But  absolutely nothing has moved. I asked my friend to visit the store and  ask them what is happening. The Store says they have updated the  documents and I need to call 18001030405 from a different number to  activate the new SIM. I call them - they again say the documents have  not been updated. I ask them for the contact number of the Airtel Store I  went to so I can call them if I cannot visit them - they said there is  no phone number.

&amp;#x200B;

5th February, I visit the store twice. They say they have updated the documents and there is a technical issue. I visited another store to see if they can help, they said they cannot.

&amp;#x200B;

I get an e-mail today that Airtel will ""contact"" me on 8th February regarding the issue. I am not even able to transfer rent and they nonchalantly say they will call me on 8th. Absolutely tosh customer support.

In April 2018, Airtel Stores tried to force me  to take up a Airtel Postpaid connection when I tried to move my dad from  Aircel Prepaid. I had to escalate it to Twitter in order to port to a  Airtel Prepaid connection.

Again and again, my experiences with  Airtel have resulted in disappointment. I am sick and tired of having to  escalate to authorities because of sheer incompetence.

\--------------------- END OF RANT ---------------------

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot even port now because I cannot send an SMS. Advise to anyone reading is to NEVER take up any postpaid connection from Airtel. They will attempt all sorts of underhanded methods to make sure you stay on Postpaid. Any help will be appreciated :-\\

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------- UPDATE 8th Feb 2019 ---------------------

My phone finally has network reception. But I have not been able to make/receive calls or send/receive SMSes since the 6th now. When I try it call, it says my verification request is in process and will be completed in 30 minutes. But it has been this way for close to 2 full days now. They again say it is some technical issue. I have e-mailed the Nodal Officer, Appellate Authority and whatever e-mail IDs I could find on Quora.

I used to think the same until i gave it a try. The SIM card is easy to get and you can port your primary number to it (not recommended).  Cutting to the chase, here is what i observed-

1. It has hands down the BEST speeds even on 3G network. I can pull upto 8-9Mbps (&gt;1MBps) ALL times of day even at this moment which is the peak hour for most of the operators.
2. Once you set the DNS to [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) or 1.1.1.1 , you are all set. There is NO censorship AT ALL of all content. All porn sites work and every streaming services work. I guess, BSNL only uses DNS based filtering. 
3. The tariffs are even cheaper than all operators. No minimum recharge bullshit or anything.

The bad and the ugly 

1. It has the worst 3G coverage (i am not even going to talk about 4G) so don't even think of relying it for travel purpose.
2. Another funny behavior i have observed is the 3G network goes down once power goes down (in my location).

The people in my class are so unskilled that they cannot connect components to make a simple circuit but study for 2 days and score top notch marks in the exam.

They do not have any clue about what the subject is about but still come out as the best students. I don't know how people recruit these kinds of students and how they manage to do their jobs.

My solution:

Instead of awarding a one shot 3 hour examination 70-80% of the subject's total marks, a continuous sort of a system must be set up where evaluation should be based on

A) The understanding of concepts 

B) Performance of practicals

C) The way in which in which someone tackles an out of the box problem (in student lingo, ""out of syllabus"" problem)

D) How good can someone design a product or a method with a limited as well as unlimited resources

One of my friends for example says that he will applying for law,bba and economic honors.

Especially since I try to keep a low carb diet. But using coconut oil for cooking isnt a common thing up here in the north. 


I need suggestions on which coconut oil I should buy. Amazon/Big Basket links are appreciated. Or if you think I can get a decent brand from the neighbourhood kerela store, I'd apreciate that too.


Second, I most make stuff like burgers, pasta, or stir fry vegetables when I eat. I sometimes make falafal and bake cakes. Is coconut oil okay for these kinda foods? I should apologize for my ignorance if these questions seem utterly uninformed. I honestly am a beginner at cooking.

Please dont recommend r/IndianFood. I feel like its full of people that dont live here. I want an answer from residents.

Update: I purchased a small jar of parachute. I bent a spoon trying to extract the solid oil. It took a minute in the microwave to convert back into liquid.

I love India and have visited all over the country. This will be my 8th trip, so I know the score. 

I have never been to an Indian wedding though. 

There are 5 events happening for this wedding. The bride, who isn't short of a few rupees, wants all sorts of crazy outfit changes. 

We have just shelled out a lot of money for the flights and visa and so don't want to pay loads of money on clothes we are never going to wear. 

We are also on a tight time schedule as we arrive 2 days before the first wedding events. 

So, Delhi people, where are some good tailors that can do me a quick turnaround on a good suit, what Indian clothes should I get that will be plain but smart (I don't do embroidery or jewels)?

I can't buy off the shelf in India in my experience. I am tall, broad and fat.

Also, my Mrs needs to get all sorts of outfits done in the same time period, so a women's tailor/dressmaker would be really appreciated as well. This is probably more important actually.

I don't mind travelling a bit.

They are relatively new and hence aren't being accepted by many people. It is very wrong to say that people have died because of pubg. They might be doing drugs or something else wrong alongside that or they might have been depressed, but media only shows and focuses on a video game to earn views.

I don't play pubg, but I still think that banning it is a violation of people's rights who play pubg to relax and release tension. Video games, like movies and music are entertainment media and cannot cause harm and can even help people feel better when times aren't good, like on a bad school or relationship day, play a video game and relax and let go of the past bad day.

Saying that because of pubg, people can die is like saying that because of Ed Sheeran's Shape Of You, people broke bones by getting inspired to box. Playing games about death and actually killing someone has a lot of Gap in between. I play call of duty and kill zombies on a massive scale. But in real life, I can't even hunt down a house lizard. Why would I think of murder and suicide because of a video game.

I am a game developer. I think banning a mobile game results in violation of my rights too. I want a safe place to publish my games and earn profit. Today, they ban pubg, tomorrow they ban other games, wouldn't this make India, the next China? where most media is banned. Entertainment media isn't harmful and shouldn't be banned.

During the interview, the person (interviewer) did not asked her a single question. Instead he told her to write something in the rough page so that it didn't seem like the interview was rigged. He then told her the questions that were to be asked in next level of PI. He asked her several personal question like where she live, who is her local guardian, whom she could contact outside the hostel etc. and told her about his connections/reference to MNCs located near our college. He also write his phone number and said not to disclosed it to anyone esp. college authorities. Now he is calling on her number, saying that he can provide job in other big MNCs in our domain. He is also emphasizing that do not disclose the conversation and the phone number to anyone. My friend is terrified due to all this and we have reported to college authorities. But we don't think the college can take any action on this matter. Is there any way to report his action so no other person faces the same.
TLDR; Interviewer trying to make a pass on my friend and we are confused whom to report.

UPDATE: College authorities will look into this on monday and we have send a call recording to them. We have come to know that the person may have told the training and placement officer of our college to debarred her from any placement activity because she refuses the job offer in the final interview, that is why he called her later in the night showing concerned and making offers in other companies.

150+ nations have moved to epassports. Including China, Pakistan, Nigeria and many other ""backward"" countries.

Some nations pre requisite for visa free travel is an e passport. (Of course, still requires negotiation from MEA's end). Why is MEA so laggard in this respect? We have some of the most brilliant IT minds in this country and yet the MEA is in medieval times.

It took the MEA until 2002 or thereabouts to stop issuing hand written passports. There again India was one of the last countries to move to MRP (machine readable passports). 

Let's also not forget that the existing passport that is issued is of quite low quality, where the particulars page is so flimsily laminated that they split.

If only the MEA worked anything like ISRO. Just lazy people running the show at the MEA.

The ones at the top of my head - Aquaguard, HDFC Insurance, BigBasket, and now ICICI Bank (in the process). 

Take the example of Big Basket - your calls to this company is never about a discrepancy of more than 10 or 20 rupees worth of products. You spend more money calling them than the disputed amount.

This is especially infuriating given that most people today are moving to prepaid accounts with unlimited outgoing. These plans only allow regular landline numbers - not premium ones. So, you need to have a postpaid account or a landline just so you can call these companies once in a while you need to.

I am sure there is going to be at least one poster here who is going to comment on the lines of ''it's capitalism bro. Switch providers if you want"" - I am not going to switch my bank account or insurance accounts just because I did not have a landline to call a customer support. Also, when my card gets compromised, time is of essence - support lines need to be accessible seamlessly. Premium numbers are a hurdle to cross at a time when 99% of phone users are on prepaid with no landline. Banks already charge me an annual sum for SMS notifications and stuff. They can always charge us similarly for support maintenance instead of making people jump through hoops while they are in desperate need for support.",,aulffb,,0,,false,1553257816,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/aulffb/highlyinfuriating_so_many_customer_care_lines_are/,,,false,Non-Political,

Another solution is to use prism glasses. They help the eyes by shifting the position of images so that the eyes don't strain themselves.

However its really hard to find here! I even tried contacting lenskart and they said that they don't specialize in prism glasses. 

Is there any place in the entire country where I can find prism glasses? Anyone been through a similar experience?

On  Friday 28th of December heavy snowfall in the upper ridges of   Darjeeling and Sikkim had left nearly 2800 tourists stranded. Completely   cut-off, with biting cold that was starting to freeze everyone, they   had almost given up hope. When the incredible jawans of our Indian Army   launched the biggest rescue operation by the army in Sikkim’s recent   history and saved them.

The tourists,  included elderly people and children, were provided shelter and food in  army facilities. Among the tourists who were rescued, 90 people fell ill  and were taken to safety in ambulances.

One  of our readers Aryan Ahmad who was present there and rescued from   Changu lake by the army, following heavy snowfall in the region, wrote   to us this short letter.

“I am Proud to  share these pictures of  our Army, they rescued 2800 people from  Changu/Tsongmo lake and kept all  peoples at there 17mile TCP camp.

I  was too present and was the  victim of this sudden snowfall, when  people had lost all hope of  remaining alive, at around 6PM our army  launched a rescue operation  whole night and rescued all the tourist who  were trapped at Changu and  nearby Maba Mandir.

Now  I really don’t fear, for I know our  soldiers are alive and with us.  They shared their bed, sleeping bag and  all stayed outside in -9° just  to keep us safe and alive, words are not  enough to thank them for what  they have done for everyone, I just wanted  the people here and across  the country to know, I am really very  grateful to them.”",,ad3ks0,,0,,false,1552596091,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/ad3ks0/2800_tourists_rescued_and_looked_after_by_army_in/,,,false,Non-Political,

While this was going on, my best friend in office suddenly threw Colors all over me. 

I just lost my temper and started shouting at him. Everyone crowded around us and people were really surprised by my anger because generally I am a soft-spoken guy who never argues or confronts other people. My friend was also shaken by my reaction.

I left the scene immediately and am embarrassed to go back to office now. I'm really pissed off that even though I did not want to be a part of it, I was affected by the stupid ""celebrations"", and every time I see these colours on my shirt, I feel really, really angry.

(a) ""Sir, the connection will be provided immediately. We already have the infrastructure setup in your locality and tomorrow the engineers will have verything setup for you""

(b) ""If you are ever dissatisfied, just give me a call and I'll come immediately to collect a cancelled cheque and the amount will be credited back within 15-20 days at most"" (Still seemed ridiculously excessive)

(c) I already have an ACT and Airtel connection and it was really curious that he singled out Airtel with a quip, ""Sir, if you're satisfied with Jio, you can disconnect your Airtel connection if required.""

Post swiping my card,

(a) Day 1: My neighbours who had paid a couple of days earlier and seen no signs of a connection called the chaps threatening to cancel their subscription. The technicians arrived, bored a hole, pulled in a wire and said they'll be back in a couple of hours with the modem. They never returned. They never called back. (Lack of customer service - check.)

(b) Day 1 (later): Called the \`Customer Representative\` who mentioned there was some server downtime owing to which they wouldn't be able to test the connection and so didn't bother bringing the modem. (Lack of stable infrastructure - check.)

(c) Day 2: Called the CSR who mentioned the server was still down so all the technicians were busy working on it (I just love that picture he was trying to paint!) and gave assurance that he'll have it fixed in 24 hours else will have the refund processed.

(d) Day 3: Called the CSR and sure enough he doesn't pick up his phone.

(e) Day 3: Neighbours called the helpdesk and the support personnel said they had no log of the request and the person who had come wasn't theirs and to raise a police complaint. They called the helpdesk again and this personnel confirmed the request was logged. (Lack of internal correlation - check.)

(f) Day 3:  Called the helpdesk to cancel my connection with the personnel pleading to give them 48 hours more. Didn't buy it anymore and initiated the cancellation and he mentioned that the refund would be sent as a demand draft by mail in 60 days, thrice the time committed. (Lack of commitment - check.)

(e) Day 4: Called the CSR and the phone is switched off. Dropped a flurry of mails to their \`care\` at JIO email address and realized they don't care. Only received SLA-hitting fluff responses. Decided to vent on Reddit! :)

&amp;#x200B;

Would recommend paying only after a connection is setup and tested though would highly recommend avoiding them like the plague.

For those who may not be aware, it's a free Wi-Fi service provided by the Indian Railways at numerous railway stations across India. I have some time to kill and like always I fired up the Reddit application on my phone to check what's new. But I couldn't connect to the Reddit servers and initially I assumed it could be an issue with the application so I opened up the browser and tried connecting but still the same. So I tried to connect through my Airtel network and both the application and the browser were able to connect. 

Never expected this to happen since I was able to connect last month when I was traveling over the Wi-Fi service. This is getting out of hand now. I mean banning Reddit? That's ridiculous. 

Anyone else faced the same?

Edit: this isn't a complaint against the government nor is it any way a cry for freedom. It's just a question about if anyone else faced a similar issue.

A woman in the group was reluctant to spend a lot on makeup, manicure and stuff. Her argument was, ""nah, I'm not here to impress anyone and I'm low on budget"". Another woman in the group kept telling her to go for it anyways. One of the frequently used counterarguments by her was, ""do it for yourself, not for others"". I did not ask her to explain it as I did not want to appear nosey.

What did she mean by it? I have heard similar arguments from women in two other previous incidents. AFAIK, makeup has always been either for camouflage or seduction. Camouflage in art forms like dance and plays is understood. Seduction, to seek a partner or attract a prospective mate, is also well understood. But what's with the profundity of, ""do it for yourself?""

I'm not saying makeup or personal grooming is bad. Even men wear makeup and are extremely conscious about their looks these days, thanks to ""fashion gurujis"" on YouTube. I'm just curious to know the logic behind, ""we do it for ourselves, not for others""? 

Is it just one of those Instagram phrases that people like to throw around to validate their insecurities? 

Or does it have any other deeper meanings? For example, are there any behavioral changes? Does it make them more confident or charming? Does it make them smarter? Does it make them healthier like exercising does? 

Edit: 
As many of you have pointed out, is staying healthy equivalent to wearing makeup?

Looking at all the responses, I have a few more questions. Have we evolved into beings who have a constant urge to look attractive despite it serving any purpose? Is it peer pressure? Or is it an unannounced competition either with others or with self? Are we, as humans, growing increasingly uncomfortable in our own skin so much that we believe that we need to wear layers and layers of makeup to feel confident and good about ourselves?",,av6ybr,,0,,false,1553269468,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/av6ybr/why_do_some_women_say_something_like_this_about/,,,false,Non-Political,

Now, if you take a closer look at the Hindi subtitiles of this video, it's sexually explicit **only** in pairing with the thumbnail. 
If you notice the thumbnail for the next recommended one, it roughly says in English ""Angel or Slut"". The second thumbnail roughly says ""Bheem's first night after the wedding"", where it seems like Bheem is raping Kunti. The third thumbnail is a male peacock and a female peacock, one on top of each other with the title ""Facts I know about what male and female peacocks do that I might have never known about"", implying sexual relations. The final one is the most annoying one, as it loosely translates to ""the one female organ men place their future for"", as a woman motions towards her breasts.

While I am not particularly a fan of Hinduism, much less children, I do think this is incredibly messed up. Parents cannot allow their children to watch videos that suggestively bait children. Bringing this up with YouTube India might be the only way. 

I don't know what's going to happen to me, now that I am discussing about it, but I will try.

After the death of Aurangzeb, the Mughals slowly began to disintegrate, egged on by feuding nobility.

&amp;nbsp;


Taking advantage of this situation, a number of provinces of the Mughals turned renegade, in particular Bengal, Awadh and Hyderabad.
Bengal at the time was the richest province of Mughal India. In the early 18th century, it contributed to nearly 50% of the entire Mughal annual revenue. With the loss of this province, and the subsequent loss of revenue, it became nigh impossible for them to field huge armies, let alone hold onto conquered territories.

&amp;nbsp;

To the South, the Marathas were on the warpath. They quickly wrested control of much of Central India from the Mughals, and were locked in a 3-way fight for Southern India with the Nizams of Hyderabad and the Kingdom of Mysore, occasionally starring the firangis- French, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, and yes, the British. 

To stave off the Marathas, the other 2 powers would often ally with one or the other Firangi- Mysore with the French and Hyderabad with the Brits.

&amp;nbsp;


For the past 700 years, there had been several invasions of India from the North West- Persians, Turks, Uzbeks and whatnot. Ever since the conception of the Mughals in the early 16th century, they were locked in perpetual conflict with Saffavid Persia. By the 18th century however, they too fell to infighting and decay and gave way to Nader Shah, King of Kings, Usurper of the Peacock Throne and the Kohinoor. Taking advantage of the massive Mughal rot, Nader Shah launched an invasion of India. By the end of their campaign, Mughal rule was so badly damaged that they could not even hold onto territories surrounding Delhi. They soon became sidelined in their own neighbourhood. A few decades later came Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the current state of Afghanistan. 

If Nader Shah's invasion smashed apart any Mughal attempts to regain control, Durrani's invasion smashed apart any Maratha attempts to take control of Northern India. The Marathas suffered a decisive defeat at the hands of Durrani at the Third Battle of Panipat (1761), and paved the way for the rise of Sikh misls that from then on dominated the region, rather than just be a smallish faction. Towards the end of the century, the Sikhs too formed an empire, headed by Ranjit Singh, Maharaja of Punjab. Soon afterwards, the Sikhs began kicking out remnants of the Afghans from India. 
Somewhere along the way, they got back the Kohinoor.

&amp;nbsp;


A bit south of the Misls, despite a massive loss for the Marathas, they quickly regained control over Rajputana and a few other rebellous vassals. They confederalised themselves and once again made a play for the whole Subcontinent.

And they actually got pretty close to annexing Awadh, which at the time was allied with the British EIC. But then, the Maratha Peshwa died, and their armies retreated from the battlefield to play a role in the resulting Maratha Succession Crisis.

&amp;nbsp;

In the meanwhile, Bengal fell to the British EIC and with that, the EIC got a big enough revenue generating unit to start financing their activities in other areas of the Sub-continent.

Infact, they made an attempt to split the Maratha throne which culminated in defeat for them in the First Anglo-Maratha Wars. Nevertheless, the Marathas allied with them to take on the Sultans of Mysore. And it was due to their combined efforts that Mysore finally fell to the British.
And with the fall of Mysore, French colonial ambitions in India were limited to a few coasts and Puduchurry.
Meanwhile, the Portuguese were confined to Goa (thanks to the Marathas and the Brits) while the other EICs either sold their assets to the Brits, or operated at a really small scale near Kolkata.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

And that, folks, is like 30% of the stuff that went down during this period. I haven't even touched North-East India at all, for example. Nor did I pay much heed to Kashmir (ruled by Afghanis after Durrani, btw). 

&amp;nbsp;


It's such a shame that a lot of this stuff is glossed over in Indian textbooks which instead, emphasise whatever happened in Bengal.

Fortunately -- or unfortunately -- I took an IT job right out of college. In hindsight, I see this as a good decision even after so many 'wtf am I doing' moments. The current prospects  on government jobs or a decent non-IT jobs are grim, yet many (60%) of graduates prefer these jobs. 

I remember the sudden drop in govt jobs in 2015 -- still makes me wonder how it didn't make into a national news. A lot of people I know suffered from it . People prepared for years and only left out because they were 2 marks short of the cut off -- personally, I think govt should offer free therapy sessions for the people who nearly made it because it is fucking depressing. The general consensus on taking a 'drop' to prepare for an exam is that it is extremely depressing(from what I have heard) -- most of your friends have moved out and you are just getting your ass busted in random coaching classes and libraries day in day out filling someone's pocket who's been exploiting you. On top of that, as it goes most of the Indian families are dysfunctional and thus the pressure to do 'something'.

Also, nobody questions the way they gauge your abilities -- I personally believe that the most of the gauging factors are flawed for most jobs and university entrances. We are encouraging muggers for our univs and essentially the people who are willing to waste a few years to our civil jobs -- not necessarily have to be the best minds.


This rant comes after I talked to one of my friends who has been trying for 3 years, couldn't make it and now has to settle for something lesser in extent.

I think we should be grateful for the Indian IT Industry, even though it exists because we do it cheaper -- I think it is the only thing keeping the country from total chaos. The Keralites have gulf, the punjabis got Canada, and those who are rich can always go for an MS from a foreign Univ. A hell lot of Indians migrated to EU/US in the 90s/00s. We don't really crib, we just find a way, we were ridden out of Uganda because we were making more money than the natives.I haven't seen a much larger exodus of people other than south asia, because people here are generally hard working but don't really find the right opportunities.

I have met at least 4 people who quit IT, just left the job and started some small business, one of them once told me,""I didn't know what to do in that city, yeah you get two days off in a week, but  I couldn't make out what to do of those two days"". It's true that most people do not feel this fatalistic about their jobs in IT, but I have met a small chunk that does, and a larger chunk that lives in some kind of a denial just because the struggle has been normalised. I think this 'security' of the job makes people feel good about themselves, but nobody factors in the vandalism the culture faces, your personal culture which changes completely.

I doubt there would be another place like Mukherjee Nagar anywhere else in the world where people 'come to live to prepare for a job' -- or equally weird SEZ tech parks in Bangalore and Pune where people change jobs every 3 years, spending their lives paying out home loans.

I doubt if there'd be another India -- and if it'd be as chilled out about all this as we are.",,b29fjl,,0,,false,1560219695,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b29fjl/a_take_on_civil_vs_it_jobs_india/,,,false,Non-Political,

So, I was attending a birthday party at a friend's place, and she is a huge fan of 'Paani-Puri' so she had the components spread out on her dinner table. Everyone was sort of seated near it and assembling it and eating. 

Now, I know for a fact that I am incapable of assembling and eating one of them without making a huge mess. It has always been the case. Also, I usually do not like to spend too much time assembling and eating them - it is just too tiresome and tedious. 

So I have this system which involves me taking all the ingredients - crushed puri, the spicy water, the sweet chutney and the ragda and mixing them together in one large bowl and having it with a spoon. 

I did this, and literally the entire room of people stopped and stared at me. Several of them were recording and stuff. My closest friends know I always eat like this, so they were sort of desensitised to it, but it quickly became the topic of discussion for the rest of the evening. 

Some other people tried it as well, while majority of the people were just too shaken up. Some were almost scandalised, so to say. Word spread, and now pretty much all my friends come up to me in college(I am in the student council, so pretty much everyone knows me) and bring up the ""paani-puri"" incident.

Memes have been born from this incident.  Videos and vines titled ""9,001+ IQ Way of Eating Paani-Puri"" have become commonplace among my friendcircle. A Drake meme where he rejects a plate of normally assembled Paani-Puri and then approves of a ""bowl"" of the mixture has also been sent to some of the groups. The meme where the guy with his shining brain/intellect increasing with every panel has also been adapted to fit my style of Paani-Puri eating. All in good fun, though, nothing malicious. Just a joke. 



Anyway, I wanted to know if anyone else does this? Or is it just me? If you have never tried it, I urge you to! It is so convenient and simple, it saves you so much of time and effort.

Just to give a little bit background when someone asked about the significance of Mahashivratri he justified it out by saying that during full moon night the water in the sea rises and since our body is also made up of 70% water therefore there has also been a surge of energy in our body. Therefore, we must also do some activities to keep that energy high.

[Sadhguru at Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ova8gHUdw&amp;t=3675s) (Question start @49:15)

The same argument has been used by the astrologers that there is an affect of terrestial bodies on human body because any two masses exert force on each other. Now, the problem is we all know the formula Gmm/r\^2 but when we consider the mass of human body the m is so low compared to G that overall force is just negligiable. Similarly many argues that there is iron in our body and magnet attracts iron so use magnet belt to decrease the weight.

I will quote psychology book by Susan:

""The practice of applying magnets to the body to supposedly treat various conditions and ailments is called magnet therapy. Magnet therapy has been around for centuries. Today, Americans spend an estimated $500 million each year on magnetic bracelets, belts, vests, pillows, and mattresses. Worldwide, the sale of magnetic devices is estimated to be $5 billion per year (Winemiller &amp; others, 2005).

The Internet has been a bonanza for those who market prod-ucts like magnet therapy. Web sites hail the “scientifically proven healing benefits” of magnet therapy for everything from improving concentration and athletic prowess to relieving stress and curing Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia (e.g., Johnston, 2008;Parsons, 2007). Treating pain is the most commonly marketeduse of magnet therapy. However, reviews of scientific research on magnet therapy consistently conclude that there is no evidence that magnets can relieve pain (National Standard, 2009: National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, 2009).""

**Wrongly Titled, I meant the Sony WH-1000XM3**

WH-1000XM3 Repair and Service Experience in India
I first owned a Bose QC35, however, I felt Bose was not innovating in terms of sound control and technology. This led me to buy the Sony WH-1000XM2 which I used for over a year without any trouble. I was completely happy with them. When Sony released Sony WH-1000XM3, I took the plunge and bought them in November 2018.

After a month of using them, I began to hear crackling noises from the ear cups. I ignored them thinking they were some issue with the Bluetooth connection. This issue pursued and the noises became so unbearable that when they randomly came up, I had to immediately remove the headset from my wearing. At this point, I decided to Google the issue and was shocked to see that this was a common issue in most Sony WH-1000XM3. Please click here to have a look at the several issues listed on the internet without a solution.

Most of the above issues came up in the warranty period and most, if not everyone had their headsets replaced, however, the shocking part is that many complain that the issues persisted in the new headsets too. Looking at the bright side and the brand name, I was very confident that a new Firmware release would fix everything and just as I thought, there was soon a release, although the issue was not listed, I was hopeful. The new Firmware release did not fix the issue.

I still could not get the headsets to the service centre, as I had a long journey coming up, I was considering to use them and then take them to service after my trip, only because the sounds were random and sometimes, they did not show up for a day or two. This was not to be and all of a sudden, the headsets died on me, they would show up in the connection but they would not respond or play music. I tried multiple devices with no luck. It was time to make a trip to the service centre.

5th February 2019 (Day 1)
I reach Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre at around 10. The place is a mess and the receptionist was at her lethargic best, but I believe, she was not trained to handle customers. I asked if I could speak with a technician, when she heard my problem, she just asked for an invoice and my headset, registered a complain and assured me there was no need to speak with anyone as this is a 100% non-repairable product and I will receive a replacement in 7 Days. Feeling upbeat about what she said, I left and went about my business.

6th February 2019 (Day 2)
I call up Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre as a follow up as, on hindsight, I did not believe something could be so simple in India. I spoke with the same lady and she put me on hold and asked their technician about the status. She confirmed, the Sony WH-1000XM3 was dead and a request for replacement has been placed. I asked her if they needed to send this dead Sony WH-1000XM3 for a replacement or if the replacement will arrive without this process being done.

12th February 2019 (Day 7)
I call Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre and was told they did not have an update for me. They asked me to call the Sony Toll Free number.

I visit the website and raise an escalation case using my job number. I receive a response within hours. I also get a call from Pranank Electronics Sony Authorised Service Centre mentioning they had a call from their regional office and that they were being pressurised into trying different firmware’s, the technician who spoke with me also mentioned that they are preparing an internal firmware which did not have a public release yet and wants to try that and see if that will fix my Sony WH-1000XM3. I was shocked to hear that everyone was working hand in hand and I was told, the local guys were getting pressure from above to keep me at bay.

This really is a trust breaker on a brand such as Sony, I bought my Sony WH-1000XM3 for around Rs. 30,000 and after facing issues and bringing a dead set within 90 days and here we are where they are trying to just about make it work and give it back to me.

22nd February 2019 (Day 18)
As I was travelling for the 10-day gap, I could not really get in touch with them and neither my local service centre or Sony tried to get in touch with me to give me an update. I called Pranank Electronics. The technician was nice enough to inform me that the effort to not give a replacement and fix the existing one was still on. Now that they determined the problem was a faulty motherboard and they were waiting to determine the part number so could order it in. I have no words to describe this deceit. On one hand, I was told that this is a non-repairable item by every person I spoke to representing Sony and on the other hand here we are where they are trying every possible manner to just make it work and dump it on me.

I write to Sony, but no response. I explain that I do not want a repair and want a replacement.

23rd February 2019 (Day 19)
I write to Sony, but no response.

25th February 2019 (Day 21)
Sony writes back acknowledging that efforts to repair the item are no longer in place and they have placed an order for a headset.

We would like to inform you that, we have placed an order for headset and we are arranging the stock from our sources. We assure you that care is taken to ensure the service as early as possible. We assure you that care is taken to ensure the product is delivered as early as possible.

6th March 2019 (Day 30)
I write a follow up as it has been over 10 days since they placed the order. I begin to wonder if they are looking for a refurbished piece of junk to dump it on me.

No response.

8th March 2019 (Day 32)
I write to them. No response.

12th March 2019 (Day 36)
I call Pranank Electronics but no one picks up. I try thrice over an hour, but no one picks up. I call Sony on their Toll-Free number. The person picks up, does not apologize, treats it just like normal. I ask when I will have my headset and I am informed that she will expedite it and I will get the replacement headset by the end of this week, which will be  16th March.

Sony also has an online option to find the status of the job which is literally useless and give random results. At the moment, it displays that the product has been serviced.

14th March 2019 (Day 38)
I received a call from Pranank Electronics informing me that the replacement has arrived and I can pick it up. It has to be seen how this replacement works or if they have given a brand new set or a refurbished one.

15th March 2019 (Day 39)
Upon reaching Pranank Electronics, I was shocked to see that there were massive letters written with a sketch on the box of the headsets. I was under the assumption that these were new. To my surprise, they had repaired my headsets and were giving me back my headsets and not a replacement as promised right from day one.

I called the manager of the store and he had no clue about this replacement promise that his staff and the sony centre had made. I called Sony care on the toll-free number. The person who picked up the call had no clue what was going on but did acknowledge that a replacement request was placed. I explained and refused to take the repaired headset, he asked me to hand over the phone to the service centre staff. I had no idea what he spoke but he finally told me that I will be getting a call from the service centre and that he was escalating my case with utmost priority. I was terribly disappointed.

I am not sure how long this will go on for but I am having a nightmare with these, the reason I refuse to take a repaired headsets is because of their short lifetime and also because I was explicitly told that these were a non-repairable product and somehow they have repaired them.

19th March 2019 (Day 43)
I have not heard from anyone as promised. I wrote another email to Sony via their contact form yesterday but no response. So, I sent an email within the email thread. I await a response. Sony India on Facebook responded to my post and asked me to share my details, I have shared the job number, it is to be seen what happens next.",,b2gqkr,,0,,false,1560223364,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Non-Political,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b2gqkr/my_nightmare_experience_with_sony_service/,,,false,Non-Political,
