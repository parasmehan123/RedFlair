I was suddenly wakened up by my sister who informed me our maid's son consumed poison.

I was shocked and still unable to grasp this happened. On top of that maid's family at her home was being uncooperative by telling her he consumed and then telling her he didn't consume poison. The kid's elder sister didn't seem to care much if he dies and was rather taking the situation very lightly.

I got furious and immediately took maid to her house where we found her son - a young chap hardly 13/14 year old. He couldn't walk, was injured ( with some plasters - at least a week old) and was crying with pain. Some kind of foam was also coming out of his mouth.

Turns out his sister thought it would be a good idea to take his brother to a 'Bengali' doctor. I appreciate the doctor who refused to take this case and asked her to go to district hospital instead.

She had no idea how to call an ambulance and was searching for a rickshaw when I and our maid arrived there in their colony. I immediately took the kid in my car and his mother to the district hospital where he was given first aid and referred to another bigger hospital.

I arranged the ambulance ( called 108 - had to explain the situation and the doctor on duty at district ambulance had to validate my claim). It was like a series of 3-4 conference calls, which was handled very very professional. In 10 minutes tops ambulance arrived and we took the kid to the bigger hospital.

The kid consumed some insecticide which had a main component - dichlorvos. I got the kid's sister to Whatsapp me the image of the insecticide and then was letting doctors know what he had exactly consumed. This helped them quickly take action. 

On hearing what the kid had and after seeing his situation - doctors told me his survival chances are low and I was asked to get his mother to sign a form for treatment with her acknowledging the risk of death, which I feel is pretty standard.

Sometime later his brother joined in the hospital, he was getting adequate treatment by then. Three days later, the bottom line is kind got discharged from the hospital and is doing well. I didn't expect government infrastructure to be so great, I'll definitely be more honest in doing my taxes. Cheers!

The authorities too tried to cover it up.","The first instance which raised the alarm was this of a 14 year old, Class 8 tribal girl who delivered her baby in the school's hostel's bathroom. The baby wasn't able to survive this ordeal.

The girl was allegedly raped a few months ago, by a college student.

The principal and several other authorities have been suspended. They had failed to report the case of pregnancy earlier and also tried to cover-up.

&gt; *On being informed, the Headmistress reached the hostel and drove the girl with the newborn out through the back door in an apparent bid to suppress the incident*.

&gt; The Odisha government has suspended the school's headmistress and three assistant superintendents in connection with the incident. Six other employees of the school are also being questioned. 

&gt; On Sunday, police arrested a third-year college student — a resident of Takalmaha village for allegedly raping the minor. Superintendent of Police, Khandamal, Pratik Singh said Shraban Pradhan allegedly raped the girl when she had gone to her village in Daringbadi for vacation a few months back.

&gt; As per allegations, Nayak raped the girl and continued to exploit her with false promises of marriage. But, after the girl got pregnant, he refused accept her.

&gt;  Soon after news about the incident spread Sunday, a large number of locals had staged a demonstration and put up a blockade on the National Highway 59 demanding immediate arrest of the culprit and stern action against school officials.

&gt; The alleged sexual abuse has come to light over a year after the headmaster of a girls school in tribal-dominated Koraput district was in October 2017 arrested for allegedly raping and impregnating a class 9 student.

&gt; A cook at a residential school in Malkangiri district was arrested three months earlier in July 2017 over allegations of impregnating an 11-year-old girl after sexually abusing her repeatedly.

&gt; ######Pregnant student undergoes abortion in Odisha

&gt; Barely five days after minor student of a tribal residential school delivered a baby girl in Kandhamal district, another schoolgirl was found to be pregnant in Kalahandi and had to undergo abortion. 

&gt; A resident of Bihar, the Class IX student and hostel boarder of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in Narla was six months pregnant. The matter came to light when the girl had to be hospitalised after complaining severe bleeding and abdominal pain on Monday.

&gt; *Such a serious issue, however, was reportedly attempted to be covered up by school authorities*.

&gt; Principal of the tribal residential school at Thuamal Rampur was arrested a month back. He had sexually assaulted a Class IX student and boarder of the girls hostel last year. The girl was taking part in the decoration of the puja mandap in the school when the headmaster committed the heinous act.

&gt; ######Another minor delivers child in Odisha

&gt; A 14-year-old delivered the child at Danagadi Community Health Centre (CHC) on Thursday night

&gt; The girl had become pregnant but hid it from family members.

&gt; After six months of pregnancy, the girl revealed everything to an Asha worker in her area, who informed her family members. Later, the victim also narrated her ordeal to her parents.

&gt; After the efforts of her family members to contact Pintu went in vain, her father lodged a complaint at Kalinga Nagar police station on December 26 last year. He alleged that his minor daughter was raped and impregnated by Pintu Jena with a false promise of marriage.

&gt; *However, the Kalinga Nagar police did not act immediately*. It was only on Thursday that they took her to POCSO court in Jajpur town  to record her statements.

And: 

&gt; ######2 students in Odisha found pregnant. The girl became serious when an attempt was made to abort the foetus of the pregnant girl at the local Narla hospital.

&gt; A day after a minor school girl at Baliguda in Odisha’s Kandhamal district delivered a premature girl child, two separate instances of school students becoming pregnant have come to the fore, raising doubts over the supervisory work of the state education department. Reports from Kamakshyanagar in Dhenkanal district on Friday said that a Class VI student of a government residential school has been seven-months pregnant.

&gt; It is suspected the girl was made pregnant by the brother of her sister-in-law (brother’s wife). The police has started investigation into the case.

&gt; As the girl’s condition deteriorated, she was shifted to VSS Medical College and Hospital at Burla in Sambalpur district.

**And that's not to say people in Pakistan don't care about this, they do recognize the problem and since 2011 have made efforts to rectify this.**

Now this came to my notice when I saw Wing Commander Grewal who was a POW of Pakistanis during the 71 war saying on a Barkha Dutt show that ""Pakistani civilians hate Hindus"" and I was ready to dismiss that as an over the top rhetoric, but after searching a bit I came to the conclusion that he was right, following is what I found after googling ""What do Pakistani textbooks teach about Indians""

[‘Pakistan schools teach Hindu hatred’](https://www.dawn.com/news/672000)

&gt; Text books in Pakistani schools foster prejudice and intolerance of Hindus and other religious minorities, while most teachers view non-Muslims as ''enemies of Islam,'' according to a study by a US government commission released on Wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; The findings indicate how deeply ingrained hard-line Islam is in Pakistan and help explain why militancy is often supported, tolerated or excused in the country.

[What is the most blatant lie taught through Pakistan textbooks?](https://www.dawn.com/news/1125484)

&gt; The most blatant lie in Pakistan Studies textbooks is the idea that Pakistan was formed solely because of a fundamental conflict between Hindus and Muslims. This idea bases itself on the notion of a civilisational divide between monolithic Hindu and Muslim identities, which simply did not exist.
&gt; 
&gt; The stress on religion ignored other factors that could cut across both identities. For instance, a Muslim from most of South India had far more in common, because of his regionally specific culture and language, with Hindus in this area than the Muslims in the north of the Subcontinent.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Similarly, the division of the historical narrative into a ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’ period, aside from the ironic fact that this was actually instituted by the British, glosses over the reality that Islamic empires also fought each other for power. After all, Babar had to defeat Ibrahim Lodhi, and thus, the Delhi Sultanate, for the Mughal period to begin.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, power and empire building often trumped this religious identity, that textbooks claim, can be traced linearly right to the formation of Pakistan.

[Why do Indian and Pakistani textbooks tell wildly different histories?](https://scroll.in/magazine/813864/why-do-indian-and-pakistani-textbooks-tell-wildly-different-histories)

&gt; In 2005, Qasim Aslam and Ayyaz Ahmad, two young Pakistanis, saw this up close. They were invited to be part of a Seeds of Peace conflict resolution camp in Maine, USA – a platform that brought together children from India and Pakistan to hold dialogues. In one of the workshops, the children compared the historical timelines of their two countries.
&gt; 
&gt; During the discussion, conflicting viewpoints emerged and ricocheted off each other – the children from both sides of the border nurtured a different narrative of a shared history. “What we realised while talking to our Indian friends was that it was very difficult to have a peaceful conversation because both sides didn’t know what the other side had been taught,” recounted Ahmad. There were evident discrepancies in the two versions of history.
&gt; 
&gt; When Aslam and Ahmad returned home to Pakistan, that incongruity disconcerted them. In their mind, it lingered and remained. Six years later, in a casual conversation, the two decided to start working on a book that would juxtapose the Indian version of history with the Pakistani one, highlighting where the respective historical trajectories deviated and merged. That was the birth of The History Project.

But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",,ai7392,,0,,false,1552682274,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Reddiquette,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/,,,false,[R]eddiquette,

What will instead matter instead is **how well you treated others.** What will matter is how many awesome experiences you packed in your life without worrying about what ""society"" or some other outsider would think/feel about it. What will matter is how much of your time you were able to give to your loved ones. It won't matter to you how much money you are having at that point in time or how many awards and certificates you've won in your life or the number of PhDs in your folder or whatever else of that shit there is. Not saying that money is bad or anything (because that's just some legit BS); but that you won't really be clinging on to any of that stuff while you're awaiting your end.  

It pains me to see how so many of us still take these things for granted and are still measuring our own self-worth because of what ""level of respectability in society"" we were able to achieve or not achieve. And I've seen this a lot on Quora particularly. And no, you can keep your IQ certificates at home if you are a dick to people because the latter is what will truly hurt YOU the most when you're dying. And yes, you WILL come to that painful realization at such a time, no matter how much of a bully or asshole you had been in your life.

Take it from a guy who has escaped death by a whisker, you'll remember even a tiny smile that you gave a stranger and made their day with - with great joy. And that you'll remember the angry words that you said to someone who cares for you in a moment of heated argument with deep, deep regret.

I only wish to serve as a reminder, a ""wake-up call"" if you will, to all of you that you ALL can ALWAYS change for the better starting RIGHT NOW. We can't go back in the past and change things.

Nobody deserves free help and trust no one. 

Story: 

So im a BDS intern. The end date of my internship is on the 25th after which i will get my registration and certificate. Got 9 departments and i already got clearance from 7. In one dept, i have already finished my work quota months back. 

Let me preface this saying that im very good at computer stuffs and i have done a few things for the college itself as official promo work [for free of course]. Now a clinical tutor in this dept [community dentistry dept] knows how good i am. Yesterday she called me to do the video project of a fellow female intern. Now i have always been taught by my mom to help people no matter what which will only be helpful for my life. So, while i already told this girl no, because a teacher asked a favor [she used the word] i decided to do it, despite my best friend signalling not to do it. In return for my work the teacher promised to choose me over another intern for the last quota thing.

Finished it and brought it today. The Teacher asked for only one 3 second audio change. I agreed to edit it. But now when the time of the work came she just suddenly forgot she made a promise and told me i was acting as a child. It hurt me a bit to see a teacher lie [no one likes this woman, she doesnt even respect the Dept HoD to honor his request. Even student has a problem with her.] but i said ok and left. I told the intern girl to do the editing herself and i even told her the steps. She wenmt and complained to the teacher that im not doing the project which im not obligated to do anyway. I could have refused but i did it. Teacher called and asked me very rudely why i wont do her work. Now i was angry and told her in a slightly raised voice that i felt exploited and i dont want to do it anymore. 
She suddenly started shouting and told i shouldnt talk to her like that. Then she said he wouldnt give me clearance. Blood rushed in my head and i stormed out after she told me to leave. My friend tried to calm me down a lot and when i was leaving i told them if needed ill call my parents because she doesnt have the right [she doesnt. HoD has a right but he likes me a lot and gives me a lot of leeway.].

Came home. decided to post here asking for a video editor's to know how much they take for these stuffs [deleted that and posted one again a few hours ago because it got no attention. Seems like i lose out a lot of money for doing things for free.] My Best friend called to tell me that the girl went to ask my ex for help and to cut my name off from the project [i was allowed to credit myself] and she said a lot of bad things about me to her [told this story here before. How i was used by this ex to get another guy she liked to propose her.]

Around 4 pm i got a call from that girl asking what software i use. I told her everything very calmly.

Few hours later my friend calls again to tell me that the girl told him that she went to my ex but as soon as she saw my name she kicked the girl out of the house. Distraught, she decided to commit suicide but her mom told to make me do her video to which they decided they would blackmail me instead [her parents will come to the college to get me in trouble.] 

[Important Tangent: 4 weeks ago i was talking to this girl about how lonely i am  for the 14th. and how great it would have been if i could control my social anxiety to just ask my crush out or HER or another girl i liked from teh college. She thought i was asking her out and i said no. She plans to use those texts to blackmail me.]

Anyway. Told mom because this was a serious charge. She told to just do the damn edit and give it to her and i was a fool to help anyone. I couldnt believe she said that because she taught me to help people!

I tried to help someone. A good deed. Now im in trouble of not getting cleared and these blackmail thing is happening.  Never thought it would cost me this much. I will never help anyone again, doesnt matter if they are dying in front of my eyes or not.

I'm from Lahore, Pakistan. Since my childhood, unlike lot of people around me, I always had a huge fascination with India. I always visualize India as an entity full of energy, passion, dreams. faith and an inspiration. To me it's not a country, it's a feeling which gives me adrenaline rush everytime I think about it. Coincidentally, I've one of my great friends from Amritsar now in Mumbai. I've subscribed Indian content (of almost all types) and follow it regularly. I'm huge fan of Indian music, cricket and much more.   


Given the slight more knowledge I've about India than many people around me in Pakistan, I've been labelled as 'Raw agent' many times by many of my friends in a lighter note. I work in Lahore and from 16th floor from my workstation I look at Ferozpur road that goes straight to Ferozpur, India.  One of my biggest wish in life,  if not the biggest one is to visit India, explore it and make great friends there. From Kashmir to Kerala, Gujrat to Arunchal Pradesh, I want to dissolve myself into the cultural diversity of India. To me, India is most unique of all countries containing satisfying diversity within. 

It really is disappointing sometimes to imagine that I won't be able to visit India :( My sister told me to keep faith and I'll be able to visit it one day. I really hope one day, one day maybe.

So we were total 2 girls and 3 guys, talking about the nonsense stuff - places to visit, items they are eyeing online, good old bitching (man I hate that) etc. I was quite and phased out (I was on my mobile too).

(In college I had two close friends with whom I could talk on any topic, taking any stand and forgetting about it the next day . )

I don't know when did the topic change and one girl asked me if I would reject a girl based on her drinking/smoking habits. I promptly replied yes. She frowned and questioned ""Seriously ?"". I said yes , as a non drinker and non smoker I would prefer the one who doesn't either.

I drafted few of the points and frustrations I had with the media and the way current government dealt with things. These are strictly my opinions and Since Reddit is Anonymous forum, I decided to put across my thoughts here in no particular order. Writing this seem to help some of the frustrations I had with current uncomfortable situation we landed in.

**Current Indian Media houses**

* Hyper nationalistic, sensational and Run behind TRP
* I am still hunting for 1 channel that does not put opinions, speculations, ""Trusted"" sources, debates, useless graphics before factual reporting.
* Still can’t understand why media want to show things which are not confirmed and corroborated by facts and official statements.
* Many channels pick old videos from youtube, pictures from internet that matches their imagination and Narrative and try to show that as reporting pieces :(
* Media houses seem to have formed a mini cartel in a race to TRP and ad revenue, Everyone including educated public and media houses know how messed up the reporting and journalism standards in multiple instances, they should among themselves come to a consensus of what is good reporting and stick to it in long term.
* Long term effects of not having a reputed and non-biased media house might hurt india's democracy image. Remember media is 4th pillar of democracy, We should keep our pillars strong and healthy. I have not followed DD news, excuse my ignorance , I follow private media houses like most Indians do

**What I think is right Media:**

* Have a strict guidelines for media reporting issues concerning National Security. Every reporting piece that comes in media should be clearly mentioning the sources of reporting, Other cases it has to mark the screen space clearly visible mentioning if the piece is Speculation, Opinion etc.
* Should follow a good degree of restraint in situation like this, 27/11, Surgical Strikes etc and be an example, not a laughing stock among its own people and others.
* I understand faster reporting and quality of content reported need to be traded off in this age of smart phones and Social Media, I am still looking for that national news channel that has this tradeoff in right proportions.
* I am still looking for that media house that has Dhoni's calmness and composure even in trying times. This might Garner respect in international community, from citizens and even from enemies

**Current Government**

* Government should be just a decision maker for military proposals. None of these should be used for political rallies or propaganda’s. EC should have guidelines for election propaganda like they have for Hate speeches. Country comes first, Not a particular ruling party win / loss in elections based on hot headed decisions.
* Government should start enforcing guide lines to media houses reporting sensitive information.
* If there are strikes behind enemy lines, why are we giving the information out such in first place, why are we trying to satisfy our anger and ego? Keep faith in out

**What I think is could be done by Government**

* Not every military action by every country will be successful every time, there will be surprises, losses and wins, let military decide what is what and government be the rubber stamp approving their proposals. Disclose only what is needed and others should be kept confidential
* Strikes behind enemy lines should be highly classified with a time limit (5y, 10y, 20y, 50y etc) after which details can be made public.
* Public and media pressure should not decide the course of Military, Navy and Airforce actions. I understand emotions can be high but again country comes first and let these professionals deal with it.
* Have a goal and Narrative, in this case the goal could be ""**JEM killed our Soldiers, we want JEM to be recognized as terrorist outfit and its leaders handed over to India and any other organizations started by its members to be going through Pak's approval with records in future**"". The Narrative and actions should stick to this until goal is reached and we move on to the next goal.
* Right now I have an opinion that we seem to have slightly lost our narrative, we are trying to show Pak used an F-16 when they responded back for our strikes? If I look at the narrative and proof's provided as a neutral source, I am more convinced of their narrative and peace proposal than India's. Get your narrative right and keep it aligned with the Goals.

**Personally**

I am against war, Religion based biases in countries and systems. I really want to see peaceful relationship between India and Pakistan like France, Germany and Europe has right now. I hope both the countries grow strong economically and have lot more visa free travel and cultural exchange. Some where deep down, I also imagine Unification of both countries and grow ourselves to be a super power. I know I am dreaming, but why not?

I need some career advice. Here's a short background before I ask any advice

- Graduated in 2016 from an NIT in Comp Engg. Went downhill from First year, ended with 60%

- Caught in ML Hype and low self esteem skipped placements for GATE

- Flunked GATE exam because of insincerity in preparation, then irresponsibly kept myself entangled in govt exams to avoid jobs, finally understood this was eating me up from within

- Finally got an actual developer job in December 2017, currently working here on a company specific solution based on an open source application. 

Did pretty well for myself, all the responsibilities fall on me as of now because the team consists of just two people (rest 3 gradually left because of salary issues) - me and another web developer who is made to learn this platform while she is being burdened with generic work.

All in all, my skills are now limited to Python and MySQL and this platform. Now my uncle almost an year ago, setup a meet with this guy who has recommended me to quit my current job and move to Pune/Bengaluru for a job (that's how he did it), also recently her wife recommended the same and said time is ticking off and you'll be regretting if you will be late in reaching those places. Also, my company is pretty lazy about being prompt in paying salaries (I need to keep calling the accounts guy for my cheque and salary is always late, however they keep claiming things will be better, also there has been some lethargy from my side asking for salary because of this frustration I guess now need become a hawk as far as salary is concerned)

Also I've got my resumes sent to 2 people who have contacts in TCS but have received no calls as of yet.

Also, recently :

&gt; Yes I did get one recently because LinkedIN made my profile on Shine.com. After I told her I'm working not in Bengaluru but in Gujarat. **She said when you come to bangalore call me back and she hung up**. Hence this quit and shift to bangalore seems sensible. Also once I got a call from Intel, and when I said I worked in Gujarat she let out a big ooooh. Finally I wasn't selected there too but that was not just the location I did bungle up a very fundamental Python question.

**I need opinions if this quit and search is a good option or not, also what more other than trying for open source contributions can I do for furthering my relevance in job market.**",,b6tfnq,,0,,false,1560301534,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Reddiquette,gujaratmap,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b6tfnq/rindia_should_i_quit_my_job_and_search_in_it/,,Gujarat,false,[R]eddiquette,

It's hard to explain clearly why I am depressed. It's a combination of deep-rooted inferiority complex and self-esteem issues coupled with awful events which have recently happened. The fabric of life has been torn. There is no structure or order in it but just chaos all around. Life is miserable when everyone around you is doing so well in their life and career and you are going nowhere. You don't have much parental or siblings support, no friends close enough to bare your hearts to and frequently cry yourself to sleep wondering if anyone will really care if you are gone. You try and post online in vain hoping someone will hear but deep down you know that people have enough shit in their life already and can't truly help you. It is you who will have to eventually pull yourself out of this hole but you just can't find the strength to do it.

So you just lie in your bed hoping that if you don't find enough strength to get out of the hole, you someday find some to dig deeper and just end it all.

I tried to improve myself since last 14 days again one thing I crave right now is friends . 
The ones around me are not friends for sure . 
Nobody helped me when I was in the most downtime of my life .

He was hit by a train last week and died instantly. Initially people considered this to be just an accident, but after the police conducted interviews and later found a note in his bag, it was confirmed to be a suicide.

Now clearly, this is a rather somber incident, and you'd expect the college authorities and the student's classmates to react accordingly, right?

Wrong. Over the past few days all I've heard from my friends, and surprisingly, even my teachers are conspiracy theories about what drove him to commit suicide, and some good old victim blaming about how stupid he was to end his life. Heck, even our HOD took some time off his lecture to jokingly ask us if any of wanted to follow his footsteps and take our own lives. People were going on about how it was about his girlfriend leaving him, his falling grades, his failures to get a job etc. Honestly, this has fuelled more gossip in my college than any TV series/movie ever would. Pretty much everyone had a theory, and pretty much everyone was vilifying the student.

No one thought about the issues he might have been facing. No teacher thought about genuinely raising an awareness about mental health issues. We didn't even observe a minute of silence before class or something. I know it's a bit too much to expect but will the majority of India ever change it's attitude towards mental health and/or suicide?

I cheated through the exaams because i knew it was too tough for me to actually make sense of the subjects and i was afraid i might not even pass.

But all this was of no use anyway- that degree is just a certificate in a file now and is not worth a rupee now because on paper i am so and so engineer but in real life, i am a loser who has actually forgotten almost all of which i studied in those years. I guarantee that people are there who still know the fundamentals of a subject and can even give the exams after many years in engineering but i was not. My memory failed me or i caused my memory to fail - in any case i cannot remember anything of that Btech.

* Got placed in IT starting with the a company starting with the letter I - you know which one- in spite of having no spectacular programming skills and because it was not Xth std Comp Science which i had a false notion that i will be good at it and thus i chose to go with the company. 

* During the training period itself, i came to know that its too hard for me to do any actual programming. Passed after failing and giving a retest with literally some help from other kind trainees. Still i stayed there. I never left because you see on paper, i had passed but in reality i had failed.

* Got posted in Mangalore, lived there alone in a 1 RK.

* Wasted 4 years there, literally wasted in a support project where due to my inability, which may be they saw through me or just randomly , i was handed the L1 part-doing triage of the issues , and open a ticket, write a select query in Teradata, give that information to the client. Just that. Why nothing more ? Because i was too dumb to actually code or solve a real problem.

* Transferred to Bhubaneswar nearby to my home last year - just for the sake of it. I am still in the company, was on bench for almost a year and could not get project because i had no skills.
But they did not kick me out or neither i voluntarily did that.

* I am in a project right now which i got at the end of the year where they use TM1, Cognos, INFORMATICA, Unix, DB2. I literally don't know any of the technologies. Searching here and there, getting called by the leads as dumb, doing the least basic task which the lead has to explain to me - this is my life now.
On top of that , i keep on forgetting things which the lead would have told me the last week. 

I do not even understand the code other people have written in the existing systems, i do not understand how they would come up with such complex logic.

* I have lost the ability or may be never had logical reasoning skills which is needed to do programming - be it any language. I don't have the ability to think of a solution to any programming requirement, do not have the skill to divide the problem into blocks and solve it 1 by1. This is not Xth class stuff - this is the real world.
I have even lost the ability to even think of something to approach the problem.

This is my wasteful life. You know what i do instead of trying to improve - i indulge in viewing tv shows, podcasts,youtube anything to just pass time and not do something constructive.

I am a listless person with no energy to face the world. I do not have any skills to even get a different job. By the age of 29, people more or less figure how to earn for their family but i have still not figured out - nor i have the energy to think of it. 

**What is the point of living such a life ?**

I have procastinated, i have wasted my years when people try to make something out of themselves and people i know who were once below me in skills have gone on to try, struggle and are succeeding in their lives. But i did not.

Why should i exist when i am the burden on my world now (my father and mother although they are trying to help me but they cannot because i have reached the end) ? 

I am a wasteful, pathetic loser in life now.I do not even an ounce of energy to solve my problems. I somehow think if i take out myself out of the equation of lives of my family and they somehow forget that i ever existed, it will be great. I have no friends now as well.

I do not blame anyone for the condition i am in right now, it was me and me only. In spite of knowing that i am wasting time and instead of doing something constructive - anything, i indulge in viewing shows/songs/podcasts just to fill that time and get that moment of fleeting happiness.

Now dear reader, if you have read this far of my wasteful life i have lived, what will you tell me? That there is still hope - but i know there isn't. That somehow you will come out of it - but i know this will never happen.

Why should i not jump out of this balcony i am standing now and end this constant misery i am in? 

Why?

We've been together for almost a year but his student Visa is ending so he must return to his home town of Gwalior in India. As I've recently completed my education, he's asked me if I'd like to join him back to India and live with him for a few months while he saves up money. At first I really liked the idea, I really to visit India for the first time as well as meet his family. However, I recently came across a few articles that described Gwalior as India's most dangerous city for women.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also this video of a Half Swedish, half Indian made India sound terribly dangerous. She said people can get chopped up there:  [https://youtu.be/OafSeEqFaw0?t=140](https://youtu.be/OafSeEqFaw0?t=140) 

&amp;#x200B;

I also heard that it is even more dangerous for Western women than it is for locals. My boyfriend assures me that things will be fine for me there, but he grew up in a family with only brothers so he might not know how it is like for women. Furthermore, I enjoy wondering around on my own and from what I read, that won't be possible for me in Gwalior as I'm a woman.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'd really like some feedback from people here. Would it be safe for me to spend some months in Gwalior as a independent Swedish woman who likes to explore alone, or is that too dangerous?

I learnt more about this app from him and this online community called Reddit India in it. I find the app useful myself. So here I am deciding to give it a shot myself as well as keep an eye on my son. I guess this is the best way I can monitor him as well as gain information from this forum. 

I hope I am accepted here as I have heard that this is a group of rather young people. I may be a bit old for your tech savvy language but I am open to learning more. Hoping for a better time here.

Why do people like Kalpana Chawla have to leave India to find success and why are we so eager to revel in her success because of her ethnicity?,"Because we still claim Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams as our own when they are not.

Syria doesn't think Steve Jobs was their contribution to the world. America is a land of immigrants. Everyone is from some or the other country.

Every country can start claiming American luminaries as their own. But no one does. Except us. Which is a shame.

I find it ironic that a whole lot of people diss on NRIs (born in USA/UK/India anywhere) yet many a lot of people are so fucking quick to take credit for something that an NRI does ... newspapers and newssites splash off headlines and write articles about Bobby Jindal, Nikki Haley, Kalpana Chawla, this that fairly regularly ..

It is definitely a big issue. Why don't people want to stay back?

Lack of opportunities. Especially in non IT fields. I'm not saying other countries have enough positions to accommodate all the electrical, electronics, civil, mechanical, etc engineers. But they definitely have many more opportunities to work, research, grow in these fields.

Slow growth - financial and otherwise.

Terrible work-life balance - this mainly stems from the fact that if one person doesn't want to work 14 hour days, there are hundreds if not thousands of people willing to put in that time, maybe even for less pay. So it leads to an evil, vicious cycle of non existent work life balance at the lower and middle rungs of the organisations at least.

Quantity over quality of knowledge in terms of number of degrees, GPAs, prestigious institutions. I've known people in countries abroad who've gotten hired based purely on their skills in that particular field and not because they have an advanced or fancy degree from somewhere. And these are people who've dropped mid way through college. And today they're earning over $100,000. I don't know how far that's possible in India. Exams and marks might not be the be all end all of selection criteria, but definitely heavily weighed upon. Again, I realise it's because of the immense competition for every single position here as compared to other countries,but that's why people choose to go outside. 

I'm a software engineer. Born and brought up in India and now I'm living and working in North America. I spent first several years of my work experience working in India. I worked diligently, weekends, extended hours, you name it. And then year after year, the salary rose by a pittance but cost of living skyrocketed.

In my first 3 years of working in India, my salary went up from 11,500 to 20,000. My cost of living for the same lifestyle during the same time went up by more than the 8,500 hike in the salary. Forget saving money, I was barely able to make ends meet. And then, a politician's family encroached 1/3rd of the land that my family had saved up for years. When we asked for it back, their exact words translated were ""Do whatever you need to. We know how to deal with the courts"". We went to a lawyer who essentially said ""These are very big people. You won't win"". We ended up selling the land at a much lower value than we could have gotten for it

Then my dad died leaving me to take care of my mom (a housewife) and a brother who was in college. The money that I was making at the IT job in India was stretched pretty bad to make ends meet

And then the opportunity came to move to the US. I hit the H1B lottery. I came to the US to make some dollars, send some back home and help out mom and brother. With the dollars coming in, my brother was able to complete college and they were finally able to own a house to live in. Life here is waaaaaaaay better. As a worker, I get respect. In India, I was just a ""resource"". Here, I was promoted because of talent and not because of length of experience. The bosses liked me because of the work I did and not because I spoke their native language. Having a work-life balance was considered a necessity and I didn't have to be available at odd hours of the day and night to be considered valuable. Commuting to work is not a 2 hour ordeal each way every day

Getting a driver's license was a 2 hour task and buying a house didn't involve bribing or a request at bribing anybody. Best of all, I'm faaaaar away from nosey aunts, uncles, neighbors, their nieces and nephews


Without a proper environment in India, the educated are better off contributing elsewhere. India will benefit from their work in someway at least until our government realises the loss and improves the environment.

Most people who end up abroad are academically better (smarter?) than those who are left behind. Don't look at one of two people. Don't look at the rich kids. Think of your batch in college. Think about the people who have moved abroad and those who are in India. Probably you would get my point.

I agreed with most of the people here that there needs to be a serious talk about the muslim community, and instead of appeasement politics there needs to be real reform coming from within the community itself to fix our issues ranging from extremism to illiteracy.

However, when I came to the right wing a lot of what I've seen is that there seems to be very little nuance here as to what the solution of our problems is as a nation. Just recently when Nas. shah made some comments, people started spouting out the most vicious vitriol towards him. People regularly call Javed Akhtar a pakistani here, and any comments from such agnostic muslims is always met with this word in bold: TAQIYYA.

​

Growing up in a fairly moderate muslim family, I can honestly say I've never heard of this phrase in my life. When I asked my parents, they didn't know about it either. I had to google to find out what it actually meant.

​

So here's some clarification which I feel the saner voices of this group might be able to appreciate. Most Indian muslims I've known in my life have been the most liberal and non practicing out of all other muslim nationalities. Most Indian muslims get offended if you call them pakistanis because it's actually offensive considering we actually like the fact that we're Indians and not pakis. Most Indian muslims practice their own version of Islam, and most of them have cognitive dissonance in that area. But most people in the right wing keep criticizing muslims with such intense and deep rooted anger that I feel like even though I agree with most policies of the right wing, I could never belong here.

​

There are people who bash muslim superstitions with such intensity, but completely shut down when you question their superstitious beliefs. I don't know if it's willful ignorance or they've just been misinformed about how muslims think.

​

Ofcourse I can't speak accurately as to how Indian muslims feel because I haven't been one for a while, and this is just anecdotal. But as someone who's probably been more victimized by his religion at birth than most people in the right wing, I can clarify any genuine questions you might have and open some dialogue. I'll try not to be biased in any way, although rooting out bias 100% is impossible for any human being.

This is a huge problem with the state of public discourse in India. Maybe even the world but that is not relevant to us.The lack of nuance while discussing any community. Coming from a religious muslim household I've never heard the term manu smriti or anything written in it discussed ever in my life but manu smriti is thrown at me because I'm an indian living in india. Every christian is seen as a bible thumping evangelist who hates hinduism. Every muslim is seen as a radical islamist. Goes beyond religions too. Anyone who doesn't absolutely detest and spew vitriol on modi is a sanghi, bhakt, gaumutra drinker bigot. Anyone who criticizes modi is a leftist and a naxal. Every tamilian is a separatist who wants to secede. Every maharashtrian is a bigot who beats up biharis.

Now there are definitely a small vocal percentage of these communities who fit these categories but victimizing the rest of the community with this brush and attacking them constantly forces them to get defensive and take an extremist position even if they aren't otherwise.

I suspect a lot of these opinions come from an internet generation whose only exposure to the community they're spewing hatred towards is the internet where they hang out in their bubble and constantly read only of the extremist opinions of that community. To add to that India is also completely unprepared to deal with propaganda and informational warfare in the internet age. We saw that in recent examples just on reddit where a rpak moderator was caught pretending to be a sikh khalistani and in the pulwama issue where even though every fact was in india's favour all the discussions in major subs were tilted pro pakistan. Its very easy to manipulate all online discourse in India with minimal effort even by a single individual. Doesn't even require some grand conspiracy by a foreign government.

Birds and animals, unfortunately, are not able to do it. They go through a lot and try to save themselves from extreme sun. Many die due to dehydration.

&amp;#x200B;

The least we can do is make some water arrangements for when (with regular refills) so that they are able to cope up with high temperatures.

Put a bowl of water outside your door for stray animals or hang one on your window for birds. This really helps them a lot and least we can do for them.

He never seemed to hate shaving. I had a Gillette pro glide fusion that i used before. The cartridges are expensive and the blades go blunt after the first few shaves. I hated shaving which did impact the way i looked.

I recently started wet shaving and the difference is huge!. Its much skin friendly( No razor bumps). It hurts less after shaving and most importantly it makes me want to shave everyday.

I used to spend 1.2k for an 8 cartridge pack, which lasted for like 3 months (AT BEST). After moving to wet shaving, the blade cost is so low. I get 100 blade pack of Astra platinum blades for 1k, which i can use for a year if i used one blade for three shaving sessions (Definitely i can use one blade for longer). Even better value is supermax blade which costs 350 rs for 100 pack. Its hell lot of value and you can save and spend em on something else.

It has a bit of learning curve. Just do not give up after doing it once. Check out youtube videos on how to wet shave. People do it effortlessly.

I would suggest watching this :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps88RU_BXlA

The initial investment will be a bit huge or dead cheap depending on what razor you buy. Parker is made in India company that makes Quality razors and its highly regarded worldwide and available on amazon if not locally. Romer razors are inexpensive. The difference is that blade angles dont need to be adjusted in expensive ones because the razor is precise to its micrometer length for any blade. A razor is a long term investment.

**Something in it for environment :**

It's hard to recycle a combination of metal + plastic. Gillette razors and cartridges are not enviroment friendly. Gillette doesn't sell DE razors anymore.

Here's the make in india products i bought and I would suggest this for starters.

Parker 24c open comb razor

The propaganda part : 

to be honest , there is nothing like propaganda in the film . The only character who was sold in a bad light was Ahmed Patel . Sonia Gandhi wasn’t shown as bad as shown in the trailer . Rahul Gandhi is shown a little idiotic in the end and some subtle hints are given in the film regarding that . However I would also like to say that the film is censored in two specific places :

(1) baru is talking to mms and the word “antoino Maino” is muted 
(2) the dialogue “agar aap Pakistan ke saath samjhauta karenge toh phir naye pradhan mantri kya karenge” is muted 

Now there is another point that I think is that there are some scenes which were removed from the final cut from the film because my bias tells me there is something wrong . I think  gutte and team chickened out and cut certain scenes from the film which might have directly maligned the image of The congress party and most of the maligning is seemingly deflected to the third front . I felt disgust towards the third front for trying to stop the nuclear deal. 

I see no other hypothesis to explain the incoherent and boring plot 

Acting : Anupam Kher doesn’t imitate MMS completely . His acting isn’t top notch but it redeems the film at a certain extent. Akshaye Khanna is cringe maxxx. Initially he breaks the fourth wall many times and then you get used to it . But after a point he does it at every moment and it turns into full cringe. Rahul Gandhi and co have played their roles well .

Visuals : they have the worst visuals . They used VFX fucking everywhere . They can’t even use a set properly . 

Screenplay and visuals : the movie has really bad visuals . They used VFX fucking everywhere . The fourth wall breaking adds to the bad setup of an already ruined film 


Overall , it’s a bad movie and I’m being too kind to it. But if you are a Manmohanphile , you might enjoy the film . The ending shows a good relationship between baru and mms (fictionalised I think) . I would recommend watching URI instead ",,afzppw,,0,,false,1552645020,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Reddiquette,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/afzppw/the_accidental_prime_minister_review/,,,false,[R]eddiquette,

I was wearing a maxi dress with full sleeves. The guy at gate started making a scene that I am not wearing decent clothes and can't go inside.
He told my ankle is visible and I have to cover it .
There were other foreign nationals wearing skirt and jeans roaming inside . When I asked him how they are allowed ,he told they aren't Indian. They aren't from our culture. I tried reasoning with him but he called a group of people and started making a scene.
He started shouting and all.
I just left. Was a really bad experience. Has this happened with anyone else too ?


Edit : clarifying stuff : This was my first visit to any mosque ever.
Didn't know that they rent gowns or chadar . The guard didn't tell any of that and just started shouting as soon as I passed him.

All were horrible in taste and i cannot perceive why people like them so much. Only difference was the degree of shittiness. 

Nevertheless, i got to experience what really happens when your Body meets alcohol. I felt lightheaded but nothing sort of the television drunk illustration. Anyway, i woke up to a slight headache. 

Review- Party was worth it and at least i completed on of the tasks in my to-do list but Alcohol isn't some sort of magical drink which you would fall in love with it. Beer is fucking pathetic.

Then why can't a guy and a girl just fucking stand in the road without being threatened of being a prostitute? And, mind it, they were not even holding hands or being sexually explicit in any way. They were standing and conversing when the local 'bhosdi-waale chacha' comes out of his home and threatens to call the police or beat them up and accuse them of prostitution. This happened today not in some rural area but in a metro city like Chennai. 

And, you know, what's worse? This is not the first time I heard an incident like this. This has been done by other uncles and aunties to us before.

Even some golden movies like DDLJ were uninteresting to me/never seen it so I thought maybe I like hollywood or other countries' movies because of the big budget, foreign feel with new things, great VFX, use of English and what not but honestly those things were secondary or external factors. It was mostly about great acting, good cinematography, the way they create private real life moments in front of camera, the way they live in those moments.

It's been nearly half century for the beginning of indian movies and we have nothing but few movies which were amazing attempt to sell new ideas making it worth a while eg. Swades,Dil Chahta hai and few others . Real was always rare in our movies and there was hardly any effort to move ahead of keeping love as focus or end goal.

Average movies also create average critics and also average or below average actors who make their whole career based on it being loved by average fans following. Honestly instead of porn ban we should had shitty movie ban which sells the idea of objectifying woman and normalize forcing love on some random person till they accepts it and yes these affects people as you can already see how people think beloved celeb personality is same as they are in their movies. All and all I  want to say it, 2018 was amazing leaving me hope for bollywood but nepotism still exists, my sister told me that the role of female lead in Simba(another average movie) was signed by a acting reality show winner but then was replaced by Saif Ali Khan's daughter.

There are some amazing underrated critics like Film Companion(Sucharita), Cinema Beyond Entertainment,Stutee Ghosh from the Quint,Mensutra(maybe)  and with the end of nepotism, I wonder how much Bollywood will improve with new quality actors and their creations.",,abgu95,,0,,false,1552568560,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Reddiquette,null,false,true,,/r/india/comments/abgu95/just_a_thought_about_bollywood_after_seeing/,,o na kar maan rupaye vaala baar baar ke na rajje,false,[R]eddiquette,

EDIT : What I said in removed content is that don't let any party to take advantage of this situation in coming elections. There will be people saying that this was an inside job and there will be people saying that we took your revenge (if another cross border operation happens). We all know what happened in 84. Everything is possible but for now just don't let anyone feed profit from this.

DO NOT let anyone take political leverage out of this.

Also this is what I think how could we defeat Pakistan:

We alone can't. Period. Pakistan is like your local gully goon who is backed by his vidhayak chacha(USA/UAE/PRC etc).
Those countries just give a Facebook message or tweet or speech that they condemn such behavior but continue business relationship and funding.

India should ASAP deny pak all business relationship/import/export/aids etc. Killing 20-30 puny soilders won't do anything. Go for the queen, go for the head. If USA and China understand that they are feeding a cancer and stop their transactions  Pakistan will be royally fucked in quarter of an year. They'll be literally begging on their knees in a condition far worse than any war could do.

But they won't. Because it's not their job or problem. We have to take first action. Juck make them untouchable. Fucking bycott Pakistan. No aid,no import,export, transport, sports nothing. Appel internationally to do the same. Appeal your allies to bycott Pakistan too.  Eventually we'll have an international group who support this. Small but effective.

This way we'll be hitting their head. Direct War and strike will just kill normal people, and poor fauzis who are just following orders.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU-QVqO1NMo


**Translation in italics for non-Hindi speakers:**

Ravish recites a couple of poems about laughter. *These poems bring to mind a recent incident of sickening laughter. A laughter about an illness that was heard by the whole nation. In the midst of students from IIT Kharagpur, a girl student asked a question on dyslexia and the Prime Minister tried to capitalise on it to make a political joke. Since then many reactions have been pouring in - reactions not from politicians, but from those who understand the pain of suffering from dyslexia, and from those who understand the duty of every student to ask questions. Teachers are writing about what the students' reaction should have been to such a laughter, and students are writing about what they felt about this laughter.*


The clip of the PM making those remarks.

*A sensitive question, an insensitive laughter, and after a moment, the burst of laughter from all around the classroom. The PM may have achieved his political goal by those remarks, but he was alienated himself completely to the anguish of sufferers of this disabillity who were searching for balm to sooth their pain.* 

The narrator then explains what dyslexia is and how it affects people.

*We know a lot about this disability, but we don't understand the pain of those who suffer from it. The student who tried to tell the PM about her project must've been expecting PM to take her work seriously, but the PM made a joke of it and the other students laughed. Rohit Kumar, addressing the students who laughed as to what they should've done, has written in an article for The Wire, 'I don't know if the student whom the PM was conversing with really wanted to laugh. Her laugh was not a bully's laugh. My decades working in educational fields has given me a good sense of the bully's laugh. It's a cruel and easy laughter that usually springs from the mockery of the weak and helpless. In my mind, hers was a nervous laughter.'*


The narrator says, *Rohit Kumar has written that he has watched the video multiple times and he was dumbfounded that such a thing was said by his country's Prime Minister.* 


Rohit continues, *'I feel it took a while for the joke to dawn on the minds of you all who were in that room, but the guffawing that followed were extremely saddening. I expected much more from the students of such a premier institute, but I guess becoming in an expert in science and mastering the technical things doesn't make you a good citizen.'* 

The narrator continues, *When a bully mocks the weak, it's easy to get carried along and join in, that's how a mob is formed. If you are sensitive and are trying to not be part of such a mob, then such laughter should trouble you. We shoul also look at the PM's remarks from the perspective of someone who is suffering from this illness. A 15 year old girl has written a message to the PM in Times of India.* 

The girl writes to Modi, *'Do you have any clue as to what I have to go through? Society just pities me and moves on, and politicians don't understand anything.* 

The narrator then says, *It's obvious that PM Modi, who often gives children tips on how to face exams, has failed a big test himself. By making a serious discussion about a serious and painful disease the punchline to a joke, [the PM] has shown that he is not serious about this subject. But the victims of this disability have pointed to another troubling aspect: if kids suffering from dyslexia need any slackening of the rope during exams, they have to give a certificate of disability from the All India Speech and Hearing Institute. They have to give many kinds of tests, and every year they have to produce this certificate.  Kids say they have to waste two months of the year for this procedure. They feel insulted by this is an added problem.* 

The lady explains how dyslexia is a hidden disability and because of that parents find it difficult to accept that there's anything wrong. 

The narrator concludes, *This is a serious problem, and people are looking for solid solutions, but what they get is a careless laugter. If only someone could make the PM experience the anguish of these children.*

I translated this to the best of my ability. I've translated the words 'dabang' as 'bully' and 'viklangata praman patra' as 'certificate of disability' from the context, I don't actually understand these words, so if I'm wrong, please let me know.",,ayu9cl,,1,,false,1560157070,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Reddiquette,null,false,true,,/r/india/comments/ayu9cl/ravish_kumars_excellent_segment_on_pms_dyslexia/,,Democracy ki bhi seema hoti hai,false,[R]eddiquette,

I'm studying in college away from my parents. Yesterday night when a friend asked whether everything was fine at home I couldn't utter a single word.

Because only I know what it felt like saying goodbye to my dad when he was called at 2am and he had to report for duty because the campus was on high alert. And I didn't know if he would come back home.

Yes. Everything is fine at home. 
Except for the 40 CRPF jawans dead and their families who have so many hard days ahead now. 
Except for the life long scar in the lives of the other 2500 people in the convoy that was attacked, forever wondering what if it had been them. And their families probably wanting them out of this system. Because no one cares about their lives anymore. It's a who can kill more story now.

Everything is fine at home except that when I called my parents yesterday none of us spoke of this because we've seen so many attacks happen while posted in J&amp;K that there is nothing left to say.

I studied my 11th intermediate in Deeksha junior college and had a triple experience studying there, I wasn’t really sure of what to do in my life since I thought I could live with the natural flow. I joined a SSC college and realised that apart from JEE/NEET coaching there really wasn’t anything else. In Hyderabad, out of 10 colleges that I picked almost 10 of them were running with only JEE/NEET coaching. I was disheartened because all my dreams of becoming a lawyer that I have developed later in grade 11 have shattered. Our country or atleast our city is has Institutions running just to produce Engineers and Docters. The IPE education that’s the basic education I was receiving was also bloody terrible. Pardon my language. As suicidal thoughts emerged another institution called PAGE popped into my head they were offering a good amounts of various coaching s such as CLAT,SAT/TOEFL/GRE,BITSAT and many more courses I was overflown in happiness I th goth I could begin my progress for becoming a lawyer, but as I proceeded for admission in the month of March,at which point of time the results of my 11th IPE exams hadn’t come out yet, I was informed that if I don’t manage to clear all my subject I would have to discontinue in the institution. I was sure I wasn’t going to clear my MATH 1A thanks to the poor and inconsistent staff in my college. I’m a cent percent sure about passing in all the rest subjects but then what has put our education system down is that where in the next 5-6 years of my education in a law school while doing LLM or BscLLB will I be taught math. I agree that being knowledges about basic math is important but in my case I’m expecting at least 65/75 in my MATH 1B paper. But surprisingly my opportunity to join a course I wish is dragged away. 

I really don’t know what to do, my parents can’t help either due to the dishonour my grades have bought them.",,b4gy7a,,0,,false,1560258193,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Reddiquette,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b4gy7a/a_devastating_past_that_isnt_helping_my/,,,false,[R]eddiquette,

I have never in fact been to India, but my grandfather and great-grandfather were ethnic Indians who to some extent upheld The Raj. Needless to say that I am opposed to colonial ideals, but I have also been fascinated and to some extent shocked by the direction that India, as well as Pakistan and Bangladesh, have taken since partition.

Having been in contact with lots of Indians (and also Pakistanis) throughout my life, I would like to hear your opinion on the current state of the current, prevailing mindset in India (while I fully acknowledge that this is  broad and to some extent impossible to define).

For example:

1. Is the authoritarian (talk-down attitude) something exclusive to Anglo-Indians (or rather the older generation of Indians/Pakistanis living in The UK)? Or more widespread?
2. To what extent is the Caste System still an important part of people's lives?
3. Is paleness/fair-skin still something that is ardently sought after?
4. What is the cricket chat like (in person)? Having seen India play a few times at The Oval I have to say that the support is impressive and jovial, but online the trolls suck! Is the discourse in India closer to the former or latter?
5. Any other insights you have about the impact of the colonial mindset on modern India?

[Statement by Official Spokesperson on 27 February 2019](https://www.mea.gov.in/media-briefings.htm?dtl/31098/Statement_by_Official_Spokesperson_on_27_February_2019) 

&gt;India had informed about Counter Terrorism (CT) action it took yesterday against a training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Pakistan based on credible evidence that JeM intended to launch more attacks. Against this Counter Terrorism Action, Pakistan has responded this morning by using its Air Force to target military installations on the Indian side. Due to our high state of readiness and alertness, Pakistan’s attempts were foiled successfully.

&gt;The Pakistan Air Force was detected and the Indian Air Force responded instantly. In that aerial engagement, one Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by a MiG 21 Bison of the Indian Air Force. The Pakistani aircraft was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side. In this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one MiG 21. The pilot is missing in action. Pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts.

Highlights

* Indian Air Force officer addresses first. Pakistan Air Force planes were intercepted. In the aerial combat, one F-16 aircraft was shot down by an IAF MiG Bison. IAF lost one MiG, he says and refers to the capture of the IAF pilot. 
* Pakistan resorted to indiscriminate firing on Feb. 26 and was befittingly retalitated.  Given the high level of preparedness Pak designs were foiled.  We are in a heightened state of alert, he (Army Maj. Gen Bahal) says. 
* Navy remains poised in all three dimensions to defeat Pakistan's provocations. 
* AVM Kapoor says piece of evidence is being presented about the aircraft being used by Pakistan based on electronic signature.  Pakistan media reports showing engine parts were not of MiG 21s, he says adding that it could be concluded that F-16s were used.

I would like to share on this platform information about Lionbridge with whom I have been working for some time. Most of the r/workonline opportunities don't work in India. You need a laptop/desktop and good googling skills and decent internet.

Link of their website: http://www.thesmartcrowd.com/workers/job-opportunities/country/india/#jobs-list

Let me share the process:

First of all you need to upload your CV and answer their preliminary questions.

Fair warning: The complete process from uploading you application to getting your first payment may take 4 months easily depending on how well you progress.

If they feel you are the right fit, they get back and give you access to a 200 page document from which you will be tested.

You then get access to the final exam for which you are given 1 week to 10 days to complete. This is the tricky part as many people have written on r/workonline that you need to answer above 80% to pass the test.

Now all this is unpaid work from your side, you may have to spend between 10-20 hours to read the guidelines and give the test.

If you fail the test, which is very very likely in first attempt, they usually get back to you to give another chance and the whole process repeats.

After passing the test, you may get complete access in 5-10 days and you start rating. The payment is monthly in you bank account via SWIFT. First payment comes ~40 days after the end of the month whenever you start.

Doing their minimum work depending on which program you are working, you can easily earn 10k doing minimum work and I have known people who have been earning 40-60k per month doing the max grind which is 20hrs/week and 80hrs/month.

The tasks are repetitive and you will easily get bored but that's the job. For example, in one job you may be checking accuracy of businesses and their map location while in other you may be looking up what you think of the results which pop-up.

This type of work is very useful to major internet giants who make the AI think like a human. The pay rates are shitty compared to what they pay globally but that's about it.

PS:If you have any questions, would be happy to answer. Also, if you have personal experience with any work from home opportunity, please share in comments.

Mujhe to lagta hai jaise kisi ne saazish rachi hai
 
Ki lafz aur mani me jo rishta hai

Usko jitna bhi mumkin ho usko kamzor kar do

Ke har lafz ban jaaye bemaani awaaz

Fir saari awaazo ko aise ghat math karo

Aise goondo k ek shor kar do

Ye shore k aisa andhera bunega

Ke jisme bhatak jaayenge apne lafzo se bichde huye 

Saare goonge mahaani

Bhatakte huye raasta dhoondte 

Waqt ki khaai me girke mar jaayenge

Aur phir bazaar me aake khokhle lafz

Bebas gulaamo ka maanind bik jaayenge

Ye gulaam apne aaqaao k eek ishaare pe

Iss tarah yurish karenge, hamla karenge

Ye gulaam apne aaqaao k eek ishaare pe

Iss tarah yurish karenge

Ke saare khayalaat ki sab imaarat 

Saare jazbaat ke sheeshadhar munadim hoke reh jaayenge

Har taraf zehen ki bastiyo me yehi dekhne ko milega 

Ke ek afra tafri machi hai

Mujhe to lagta hai jaise kisi ne saazish rachi hai

Magar koi hai jo ye kehta hai mujhse ke hai aaj bhi

Lafzmaani ke aise parishtaaro shahada 

Jo maani ko yu bezabaan lafz ko aise neelam hone ne denge

Abhi aise deewane hai jo 

Khayalaat ka

Saare Jazabaat ka

Dil ki har baat ka

Aisa anjaam hone na denge

Agar aise kuch log hai to kahaan hai

Vo duniya ke jis kone me hai jahaa hai

Unhe ye bataa do

Ki lafz aur maani

Bachaane ke khaatir zara si hi mohlat bachi hai

Mujhe to lagta hai jaise kisi ne saazish rachi hai

Mix all the voices to make it a noise

This noise will create a type of darkness

Lost in their meaningless voices of mute greatness

Finding a way after spreading a lie, 

Falling in the valley of time, they will die

In the market, how the shallow words behave? 

Words will be sold like a helpless slave

On the orders of their masters, these slaves

Will act to create countless graves

Every idea

Every thought

Every emotion

Will be demolished due to their own bias

In the ghettos mind, there will be chaos

I think there is a conspiracy

But there is still a hope to this day

Due to those who mean what their words say

You can't put a bid on their words

You can't cage these free birds

Who still uphold the values

Of thoughts

Of emotions

Of every hearts

They won't let you get away with that

If there are such people, where are they?

Wherever they are, in any corner of the world

Tell them

To save words and its meaning from the clout

Time's running out﻿

**Problem**

Seeking a job as a senior programmer or architect of some sort, but unable to get a foot through any door since more than 2 years.

**Current Job Description**

I have a job as a technical architect since the last year or so. I was working as a product manager at the same company before that. We use Microsoft technologies at this place. The job has paid bills until now. But the future is bleak.

The product we sell was built by a very poorly led team, and as a result, the implementation sucks donkey's balls. This severely affects our revenue stream and we lose customers as quickly as we get them. The previous architect was fired last year and most of the young developers have found other jobs and moved on. There's no cash left any more to rebuild from scratch and I'm afraid the company will go belly up in a few months.

**Steps Taken So Far**

I signed up with the usual job sites - Naukri, SO Jobs, Head Honchos, etc. and customised résumés for each application. I apply only to 1-2 jobs per week, so that I can really pay attention to what they want and highlight my relevant experience in the application. The only company that called back was Thoughtworks and told me honestly that I didn't have what they were looking for. Others haven't as much as nodded in my direction.

I'm at wits' end now and have no idea what to do. I'm past 40 and don't really have the chops to get into middle-management.

Any advice from you guys would be very helpful.",,axir1e,,0,,false,1560134282,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Reddiquette,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/axir1e/serious_career_advice_for_ageing_software/,,,false,[R]eddiquette,

It's not just about beach, its everywhere. One of my friends from UK was visiting India. She and her girlfriend both were in Delhi. Random people kept coming up to them and started taking selfies or pictures of them. When she mentioned this to me, i died of shame. I didn't know what to say.

It's a different thing if you know the person and you want to click selfies with them. But just walking up to white people and demanding selfies is simply crazy.

What do they even do with these selfies?

Note:-Unlike from the Newspaper articles given in the net, this is ""from"" the person who wrote it and what Many many had told...

This is related to the Science stream..

It all started on February 5th and we did not get enough time for revising or so ...Let me start from the practical section....

*Physics Practicals (Feb 5)-The experiments were easy. Almost everyone got the correct answer and the procedure part was typed in a simple way and everyone were satisfied...

*Chemistry Practicals (Feb 7)-This was easier than physics. Everything was balanced...No one found it difficult to get the confirmation tests..

*Biology Practicals (Feb 11)-The questions were of an easy pattern...The identification of specimens were not hard and the physiological experiments were also easy....

*Computer Practicals (Feb 13)-I'm a Bio student,so, with what i have heard, the Practicals were easy..

Now the fun begins...

*Computer Theory(Feb 18)-For many students the paper was easy...but for some ,output questions were hard. The K map and programs were easy by the way...(Said by a trust worthy source)

*English Grammar (Feb 21)-Although some grammar questions were a bit tricky but, question paper was overall very easy.The passages were silly but they essay choices very good.

*English Literature (Feb 25)-The Tempest was easy.. However, the short stories from""Echoes"" had dull selection... It compressed of 1 dull chapter and two philosophical stories.. The poems from""Reverie"" had a slightly better choice as it had one simple poem and two philosophical poems.. students actually did not expect this dull paper...

*Chemistry Theory (Mar 1)-This had a slightly unusual question paper ...the questions were somewhat different from the previous year types ,the numerical section was easy... the inorganic was kinda easy but they give more equations in organic section. The students actually did not expect some type of questions to be found here. Many did find it difficult... The most common review is, ""Just Satisfactory""... This paper was negatively reviewed by many students...

*Maths (Mar 5)- Sigh , this was the hardest Maths question paper CISCE has sent since idk....many many years i think.... The question paper was lengthy, the questions were harder... Many were not able to finish on the correct given time. Section A was hell for....many section B was kind of moderate while section C (which was mainly for the commerce) was much more easier...students had high hopes for this one but it was ultimately lead to a disaster... After all the exams which we are faced,this was the most negative received exam paper... For many, their dreams were shattered..

Analysis:-this year's question papers where harder than the previous years... Many had hopes, which lead to an utter disappointment... The chemistry and maths qp actually played with everyone... This was not a ""SATISFACTION""EXAM!!!

I actually have no idea what these ISC people are doing. Just making the question paper hard does not make a good standard. It's like the ISC people are trying to be the CBSE board. if this trend continuous for the coming exams and for the coming years,I don't think there would be anyone left to study for the ISC.Then, people would opt for CBSE or any local syllabuses... The main reason which people choose ISC was ""JUST"" .because they were studying in ICSE in the 10th standard. Now they are making fun with your lives.. it's like making all these 14 years go to the trash... And since India is a highly competitive country,the Board marks will surely affect those who are aspiring for high colleges...it has made thousands of parents lose their hope for the child and the pupils also have lost their hope for the coming exams and the ISC is doing a great job in that.

I don't know who is actually the wrong here...IS it the teachers who has not trained the students properly with proper methods of teaching and proper revision?????? Or is it just us who did not study properly for this board exam???? Or is it just council who is trying to bring a change in the ""Standard""of the paper????whatever it maybe it is just messing with our lives. And like common people ask ""what will you do without having good marks?""which is our situation... Demotivation is Never A Factor for Quality...

Based on the reviews of many,here is my rating of each subject in their difficulty level..

Computer Theory-1.5/5

English Grammar-1.75/5

English Literature-2.5/5

Chemistry-3.5/5

Maths-3.75/5

Note:-this is just the average ranking which I made after reviews from many many students... Personal ranking might be different, but, this is just a summation... I earlier did post this but, had to remove due to some problems... Thanks for spending your time reading this and share your thoughts... It took me some time too....

On the first day whilst going out, we were stopped by cops and told it's illegal to drive a white board taxi. He harrassed us and didn't let us go further. Threatened us that we might have been driving a stolen vehicle and could press charges. Made us call the dealer soon, and spoke to him. Following which he took 500 rupees from us and let us go. 

&gt; We didn't know it was illegal to rent the white board taxi; the dealer never told us.

&gt; We couldn't fight with the dealer knowing he had our original IDs.

Had to give back the car, pay for the days and loose precious time of the trip. Got another yellow board vehicle the next day. 

&gt;Today, spoke to a friend who had been there. And said he'd been through the same hassle. Every single detail was similar. Makes me realise this probably was an inside job, with the cop having a setting with the car dealer.

What can I do? All I got is the phone number of the car dealer and I really want to get back at him for wasting our time and money.

&gt; She was a noted figure in the economic circles was awarded as Philanthropist of the Year by Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry (FICCI) in 2011. 

&gt; As an AAP activist, Sanyal was instrumental in the petition that challenged Mumbai Port Trust’s handling of coal imports in Mumbai’s Haji Bunder port area. She pointed out that the area spread across 25 acres was facing environmental and health threats due to negligence on the part of MbPT.

&gt; Sanyal also authored a book entitled ‘The Big Reverse: How Demonetization Knocked India Out’. 

&gt; She reportedly left various Whatsapp groups of AAP members last month, saying she wanted a ‘detox’ from social media.

&gt; Vice Admiral (retd), president of APLI Mumbai, a non-governmental organisation, hailed Sanyal’s ability to bring together people from diverse walks of life with the objective of formulating public policies. “She had charisma to attract the young talent, old people and others to formulate the public policies,” said Rao.

These packages cost a lot so I thought instead of selling them I'd help a fellow student out.

If you're going to start preparing for JEE or are going to start your 12 or 11th, live in Delhi or Ghaziabad or Noida. I'd be happy to help you! 

I'm currently out of station so I can't give them to you until I'm back. My apologies.

Anyway! 

I'll be selecting someone from the comments in a few days. Give me a reason why you need it. We'll discuss and I can give them to you!

I am from a western Indian state and belong to a community which strongly adhers to castism. My family is struggling a lot socially. 
My father has already ran away for more than 10 years now and we are in no contact, we dont even know where he is now. There was an intercase marriage of one of my sibling. 

Due to these two things, my maternal and paternal side relatives have basically stopped all the relations with my family now. They dont invite us to any function anymore. However, they shamelessly ask for all kind of financial help when they need. 

I am feeling bit helpless now as this is becoming a big hurdle in my marriage as no one is willing to even come up with a rishta or anything like that for me. My mother is very stressed about it. Even though I have a great job, I am not getting any proposals. The ones I have shown interest, clearly back out when hearing the family situation. I have been trying very hard to stay strong but now I am starting to break down. 
I always wondered what is that ""chaar log kya kahenge"" thing as a child, till now I was under impression that there is no such thing. But now, I am indeed realizing what that is about.
Just wanted to speak my heart to somebody hence posting.

They have tried this for many years. Here you can see people literally arguing with traffic police personnel about how 'They don't need to wear helmets'. Some people literally get aggressive.

Couple of years back I lost a friend in a road accident, He was driving a bike without a helmet, His head was smashed on a divider. I was unable to see his dead body that day. And the look on his parents face when they came to know that our son met with this fate.

I have never skipped wearing helmet from that day, Its like a kill switch for my two wheeler now. 

The traffic police hardly gets anything if you wear a helmet - Its for your own safety, Infact their department earns revenue when they catch you not wearing one. People talk to traffic police personnel when they get caught as if they will be doing a favor on those policemen by wearing helmets.

These people who proudly say that they wont wear helmets no matter how strictly the police enforces the rule, Have these people lost their mind?

Fuck your hair style, If you die you wont have a hairstyle Infact even your kid will have to shave his head. Accidents don't happen announced. Even if you drive properly there is a risk of someone else losing control over his vehicle and crashing into you.

Please wear helmets.

This is my[ second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a6plky/why_is_this_called_ladies_helmet_do_females_have/) on helmets, The reason I keep posting about it is that the images of a dead friend whose head was smashed keep flashing in front of me once in a while

However, in the last 2 months I noticed the temperature rising to mid 80s, throttling the graphics card. Before this, the card rarely if ever rose above 70*C under the heaviest of loads. (Airflow in my case is a non issue as I have 5 fans in a recommended intake and exhaust configuration. This was verified after I put my old GTX 770 in, temperatures have never exceeded 73*C on this one)

Furthermore, the 1080 Ti would regularly crash while browsing with a black screen and eventually recover with an error: ""Display driver has stopped responding and was recovered."" Again, this issue does not occur with the 770 I have since put in its place. Also the files I recorded with Shadowplay would either be corrupted or be stuttering like mad.

So I figured the 1080 Ti is the problem, not any other component in my PC and submitted the card to the Gigabyte service center for RMA. That was on February 19. Today the service center called me to say the card was fine. Their engineer tested the card and he says it's stable at 95*C to 100*C. That doesn't sound good to me but that's not all that was wrong with the card. The guy on the phone said the engineer could not replicate the black screen issue. It doesn't sound like the engineer tested properly at all, nor did he say anything about the Shadowplay issue.

Now Gigabyte said nothing was fixed with my card and I won't be getting a replacement.

BUT THEY MUST.,"So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn't very surprising for me as I've been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. 

Following five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):

    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) 
    Border Security Force (BSF) 
    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 
    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) 
    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)

CRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or ""war-like"" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. 

The CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).

CAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay &amp; perks. 

&gt;A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience

&gt;“We’re like a body,” he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. “Just because the heart is more important, you can’t ignore the knee.”

CAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan's viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. 

&gt;Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to ""other"" unspecified medical reasons.

They even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.

&gt; Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include ""lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife"".

TL;DR:

We comfortably deify the army but we don't understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. 

But more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.

&gt;Rulers will become unreasonable: they will levy taxes

This one is obvious.

&gt;Rulers will no longer see it as their duty to promote spirituality, or to protect their subjects: they will become a danger to the world.

All the strife happening in various parts of this planet bear testimony to this.

&gt;People will start migrating, seeking countries where wheat and barley form the staple food source.

Mass emigration from Northern Africa and Arabian countries to Europe is a thing.

&gt;Avarice and wrath will be common. Humans will openly display animosity towards each other. Ignorance of dharma will occur.

We do this. All the time. In our own country at that.

&gt;Lust will be viewed as socially acceptable and sexual intercourse will be seen as the central requirement of life.

Reddit's echochamber resonates with this loudly.

&gt;Sin will increase exponentially, while virtue will fade and cease to flourish.

Amit Shah, Donald Trump et al can do whatever the fuck they want.

&gt;Women will no longer get married.

Fertility rates are going down and marriage ages are going up.

&gt;Traditional castes will disappear and everyone will belong to a single social class.

&gt;Brahmins will not be learned or honored, Kshatriyas will not be brave, Vaishyas will not be just in their dealings, and the varna system will be abolished.

In our own country, we are calling for this.

Now, I'm not saying that all of this is necessarily a bad thing. I just find it rather hard to believe that a document written thousands of years ago over a duration ranging from a few centuries to one millennium is accurately able to predict the state of this planet during this point of time.

I have not actively analysed the contents, and I have limited knowledge of Indian history to draw from, but something is really weird. Shit like this gives ammunition to those who would like to go back to the supposed good ol' days of the Vedas.

I have an appointment with lawyer next monday to discuss this over. The wait of next two days sees unbearably long.

I am very methodical and I'll deal with this issue just like that. I am going to write down everything I plan to do, rehearse it multiple times with my lawyer (he responded), plug holes and build a solid case.

There are many suggesting that I don't monitor her activities as it's illegal. I can appreciate that. But I am anyway going to do it.

On top of that, bollywood makes shitty raps that means nothing other than a self-fellating bunch of tatti that's spewed with highly disgusting misogyny and stolen beats. The original hip hop culture was a fight against an unjust system. Today it is a vestige of a bygone era that is only reminiscent of what was once a show of art and discovery of a new style of music. What is left now is a barren landscape of electronic distortion. From this, we have the current crap (crop) of bollywood tatti that will be showered on us on 14th February. Somehow, it will be a 'new generation' thing that will rebel against some unknown powers that this film is trying to portray. It is being made by a person who has not seen the other side of the street and will not hesitate to misuse it for a pile of money that is not earned with dignity for it is an unabashed soulless copy of a surprise hit 8-mile. I can't wait for more shit 'rap-battle' movies to come after the success of this and idiots out there praising Ranveer (Apparently Self Made) Singh for his 'earth-shattering-mind-blowing' performance that is supposed to get him an Oscar and what not. There will be articles all over praising 'authentic' acting from Aila Bhatt and numerous phone ads in which she will talk about her struggle as a Muslim. 

Everything, about this trailer, looks fake. Just because you show an ariel shot of a slum does not make it look authentic. There is literally no underground rap-battle scene in Mumbai. There are no empty warehouses where people congregate to drop beats along with the rich and poor competing to battle out poetic superiority. 

Maybe I will watch it when it comes on streaming services. Until then, I know this cancer will be out there turning frogs in the water gay and making some useless asshole to think he can rap in some unknown underground rap battle den and turn into a star overnight.

And, don't get me started with 'Indian Rap Scene'. Most of these so-called 'creators' have been blatantly copying from American hip scene and shamelessly lifting beats. They have only added hip-hop to bollywood and have added nothing original to the milieu.

That being said, I understand your desire to watch this film and to fellate on Ranveer Singh, but for god sake, this is not original and it is not great film making.

The very first thing that came in my mind was that, this has to be a scam. But the alleged paytm employee whose name she says as 'Pooja' managed to not only tell me my registered mobile number which I had used to create an account on paytm, but also my entire residential address !

&amp;#x200B;

But, I was still suspicious, so I humored her for a bit and then told her I was unsure which product I wanted and was it possible to call them afterwards, she obliged by saying yes, but told me to call in an hour. In that time, I decided to google recent paytm call center scams, and this one resembled my experience word for word :- [https://consumercomplaintscourt.com/fraud-call-in-the-name-of-paytm-mall/](https://consumercomplaintscourt.com/fraud-call-in-the-name-of-paytm-mall/)

&amp;#x200B;

I then called them back, recorded the entire conversation this time, wherein they also said that they are not giving the product completely for free, but I have to first login to my paytm account and then buy a 5000 rupees product, and then I can have my desired gadget.

I hope you spread this message, especially to our older, not so tech- savvy population\[mostly, I guess\] as nobody should fall for these deplorable scams.

I do not know whether this is a paytm leak, or they sold customer information willingly to third parties, but this is just disturbing, to say the least .

“I get to see very less of sunlight for the most part of the year. Need to rise very early and by 7 a.m I join my abba (father). I help him in making carpets. Our room is very small and it gets difficult for both of us to fit in. Mostly, it remains dark as there is only one window for the light to come in. Carpets are not easy to make. It takes us around 12 hours every day and I hardly get a sense of time. My eyes hurt and the back aches a lot. Sometimes I hear my friends playing outside. I feel such an urge to join them. But it never happens. We are very poor and if I do not make carpets with Abba, we will not be able to have food on our plates. My studies have also stopped. I used to love going to school as I had so my friends there. But had to drop out after the second standard because my parents were not able to afford my education any further.”

**I. STATE OF EDUCATION IN JAMMU &amp; KASHMIR**



**One of the unseen causality of militancy in the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir has been the education sector.** Children are thus one of the most affected cohorts, vulnerable to the impact of these conflicts with breakdown of families and loss of social protection system.



There are innumerable evidences that flag the dire state of education in the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir.



**1. The state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir has 6th lowest state-wise literacy rate in India at 68.74% which is 5.30 percentage points below national average at 74.04%.**


[Comparison of Literacy Rates of Top 5 States, BIMARU States, and Jammu &amp; Kashmir (2011 Census)!](https://imgur.com/2albrpG)


Thus, the literacy rate of the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir is not only below national average, but is comparable to literacy rates of BIMARU states.


**2. Net Enrolment Ratio (N.E.R.) has also consistently been below not only the national average but also that of BIMARU states.**


[N.E.R. of BIMARU states and Jammu &amp; Kashmir!](https://imgur.com/DVQtV4e)


**3. The state also fares very poorly on other performance indicators such as percentage of schools having computers or access to electricity.**

**II. WHO ARE WE AND WHAT DO WE DO?**


Child Rights and You commonly abbreviated as CRY (https://www.cry.org), is a non-profit organisation in India, which aims to restore children's rights. CRY works to uplift thousands of underprivileged Indian children denied of basic rights by working across levels - from direct action, advocacy, mobilising public opinion to policy change.

Our Impact:

* Among 3,35,000 school going children, 9600 children who dropped out, between 6 and 18 years were re enrolled.

* We ensured that 33,000 children were immunized within their 1st year.
* We identified 21,600 children with varying degrees of malnutrition, 7000 among them were identified as severely malnourished (SAM) and were brought under the safety net.
* **Over the last 30 years, we impacted the lives of more than 20,00,000 children across 20 states in India.**

**III. OUR WORK IN JAMMU &amp; KASHMIR AND SUCCESS STORIES**


Currently, the organization has two partners in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, namely - Jammu and Kashmir Association of Social Workers (JKASW) and Koshish that aim towards bettering lives in the districts of Bandipora &amp; Baramulla, and Budgam &amp; Ganderbal respectively. The projects roughly cover a total child population of 16,705 which includes 8,419 males and 8,286 females.


We, with the help of its on-ground partners in the state, runs Child Activity Centers (CACs) that provide a safe space for these kids to play, talk about their fears and issues and express themselves. These centers are meant for never-been to school children, dropouts, children on the verge of being drop out and child labourers. Using light forms of entertainment like music, theatre, drawing and sports, these centers actively work to engage children in various activities, with the aim of restoring some level of normalcy in their lives.


The goal for CRY and CACs is to provide children with the necessary support and motivation and help them get through their tough times.


2 of our Success Stories are:


**1. Sumi Aziz:**


Sumi Aziz, lives in Nagbal village, where accessibility to the basic facilities of living is very meager and the community people have to move to the main town to buy the basic amenities for their day to day living.Sumi never joined school as she was just 1 year old when her mother passed away. Her father and brothers were labourers trying to make ends meet for their family. Her sister also dropped out of school in order to take care of household responsibilities. There was no one in Sumi’s family who could teach her the importance of education and school enrollment.


The CAC representatives identified Sumi as one of the many children who have never been to school. Meetings were conducted to educate the family first, the importance of going to school as well as to motivate Sumi to let her interest rise up in the learning process. The learning from the sessions at the CAC had developed swiftness in her learning interests and very soon she was able to get admitted to a regular school. The CAC representatives have also been actively encouraging Sumi’s elder sister Amina to get involved in the process.


**2. Nighat:**


Nighat had never been to school prior to CRY and Koshish’s intervention. The reason being, the family members being bust with their own work schedule and the school being almost 3 kilometers away from her house. The route to school from Nighat’s house was in the periphery of forest land and was unsafe for a child to go to school alone without any elder accompanying her. CRY and Koshish’s team held various meetings to get the child acquainted with basic forms of education and the fact the CAC center was very close to her home convinced Nighat’s family to opt in for the learning process. A survey was conducted to identify more children in the vicinity and a program was organized to make sure that all the children went to school together thereby eliminating the dependency on family members.

People, often lacking any actual background in Indian history, criticise Gandhiji for reasons that are not even factually correct. They believe that Gandhi had little to no effect on the Indian Independence movement and that he colluded with the British, although there is no significant evidence for either claim.

There are a few possible reasons for this. For more than half a century, Indians have believed that Gandhiji was a saint, quite aptly called a Mahatma. However, this portrayal of Gandhiji has proved to be rather counter-productive. The people were bound to be disillusioned by this image as he was only a man. Sadly, though, this disillusionment has come with a vengeance. People have suddenly jumped to the opposite end of the spectrum. This change in sentiment is due, in no small part, to the RSS and the venom that the organization spews through its members. There's also the disillusionment brought about by age. People tend to believe less and less in idealistic principles like Satya and Ahimsa as they grow older, instead believing in some sort of ""direct action"".

Many people place Bhagat Singh and Netaji Bose on a higher pedestal. While I do understand that their ideologies might be rather attractive, neither of them had a sustainable vision for India. Bhagat Singh believed in a strictly Socialist state, even leaning towards anarchism and Communism. His ideals of violent action would have brought more evil than good. Subhash Chandra Bose on the other hand committed a great folly asking for help from the Imperialist Japanese. It's hard to imagine what he expected. The Japanese free India from the British and then? They just hand it over? If the Japanese had not turned back from the North-East, we would probably have to fight a second War for Independence. This is, however, not to downplay the roles of either of them in the Independence movement. Every single one of the freedom fighters was a brave Indian and gave what they believed the country needed, and I deeply respect every one of them for it.

There are several criticisms of Gandhi. Some legitimate, some not so much. We could discuss any criticism you guys want to put forth. I just made this post because my heart sinks whenever I look at Facebook comment sections with people uttering absolute falsehoods against Gandhiji simply because they've bought into the propaganda around them. I couldn't just stay quiet anymore.

This was a couple days after Christmas and me and my buddy went out drinking. A friend, who's a teetotaler, joined us later that night and the bar called last shots at 11:30. This would be my last drink with these friends in a while since my friend was leaving the country. So we decided to post-game by grabbing some booze at the local MRP and going to my place.

While my parents don't mind the occasional drink, they don't know that I smoke and at 1 AM, with drinks in hand, we found a comfy bench in front of my very own home to enjoy the night with a much needed cigarette.

2 cigarettes were ""countered"" and a Hoysala cop car stopped in front of us. Though we tried to explain our side of the story, we were shoved into the van and taken to the police station. 

After some ""negotiating"" the ""fine"", they finally agreed to let us go. Just as my friend was taking out his wallet, his vehicle key fell out. The cop grabbed the key from his hand, as he bent to pick it up. And asked us to go take a seat.

A while later, a clumsy, drunk man traffic inspector came to the station. I'd more readily describe him as a vagabond, than an inspector. He asked us to take a breathalyzer test. He slapped me twice and my friend once as we protested to take the test. Yes, we weren't the ideal citizens! But the only offense we'd committed was drinking (quietly, if I might add), on the footpath.

Finally, we budged and took the test. They conveniently missed testing our teetotaler friend, who was our designated driver for the night. After slapping a total of 7 traffic related cases, including one for not wearing the seat-belt and causing obstruction to the traffic, they let us go telling us to collect the key after paying the fine at the court.

That wasn't the end of the ordeal. We were absolutely clueless when we went to court the next day and this advocate approached us saying he'll handle the process for a price - ₹2,000. Now that I look back at it, the price was uncalled for since he spent less than 5 minutes filling out a single form. It's hard to not believe that the court process is made to be intentionally hard for an average man to navigate around. (The advocate shares his cut with the others). 

While trading tales with a stranger at the court, he was telling us about how the cops have targets to meet. He was narrating a conspiracy of how the cops spend the first half of their quarter mostly taking bribes and not meeting the targets and at the end of every quarter, they try frame people to make up for it. This seems to explain the behaviour of the cops we had the unfortunate luck of meeting the previous night.

After paying an additional ₹2,000 to the drunk traffic cop from the previous night, for no apparent reason, he asked us to meet us outside the police station to collect the key. He opened the trunk of his scooter to reveal a bunch of keys along with a neatly stashed cover with what looked like a liquor bottle.

I don't know what I could have done differently that night. Not sign the receipt ""confessing"" that I was driving drunk and get slapped a few more times? Contest my case and plead not guilty in court?

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see it there are 4 possible ways to solve this. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. India invades Pakistan and takes back Kashmir.   

\- This essentially means a nuclear war and I don't see any Government  (right wing or otherwise)  being OK with tens of millions of their people dying and the countries thrown back in to stone age.  

2.   Plebiscite in Kashmir with option to join either India or Pakistan as per UN resolution? 

\- No Government in India will  agree to this and the UN resolution is worded so vaguely that it is impossible to implement. 

3.  Independent Kashmir. 

\- No Government in India or , I believe, Pakistan is going to agree to this.  

   4. Make Line of Control the actual border. 

\- While this seems like a reasonable solution, there will be a lot of opposition by the Pakistan army(which essentially runs the country) given the number of lives lost and for any Government in India, giving up the ""Kashmir is an integral part of India""line,  is essentially political suicide. Not to mention the Kashmiris who won't really jump with joy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot see any of the 4 solutions being feasible. So, the only way forward I can see is the status quo where we fight a low intensity war where no win will win and hundred of Soldiers and civilians will die.

   Using a throwaway for this. I'm(24F) stuck in a rut and trying to find some help/advice here. I had an ok-paying job in an awesome city (Bangalore,India). Then I got an admit to a good bschool and will be pursuing my mba in a couple of months. And so, I had left my job  a month ago because I(..and pretty much everyone except my bad manager) felt it was a dead end job where I knew I would be stagnant. I wanted to start fresh reset my mind before I go to bschool.
I moved cities and moved into my parents house in Chennai. Its been one month and everything has taken a bad turn. My parents have their own issues. I feel like I maybe burdening them, though they say I am not. I thought I had a plan before coming here, an internship. Something. I am feeling lonely without my office friends. I have started double thinking everything in my life. Mainly my career and my love life(failed 2 attempts). My diet got messed up. I stopped going to the gym. In Bangalore, I got past my comfort zone to actually set a proper diet and go running every day for 5 days a week. I travelled. Now all that has gone to shit. When I came back to Chennai I went to my dad's gym and trained with a trainer there. I was on trial and given my base fitness I really loved the training here, even the trainer would take an interest in training me. But sometime after a week I had stopped. My trainer asks my dad what happened to me. My dad has to manage saying my health's bad. I have put on weight and have gone backwards to that mindset of ' too out of shape to go to the gym'. 
Career wise. I graduated as an Engineer. Shortly after became a graphic designer while simultaneously going for weekend acting classes as I wanted to be an actor. All this before I joined the IT services sector as I had got an on campus job offer.
Now that I am back and jobless before I go to bschool, I feel empty. Not aware as I left the newspaper reading habbit(used to love reading livemint/the economist). Seems like I don't know what I want anymore. I don't know what interests me anymore. I don't know what to do these 3-4 months! Added to this I really don't know what career path I want to take. This is all disappointing knowing I learn pretty much anything pretty quickly. My ex-team members liked me and my work and I had some purpose(though that was short lived, before I knew the job was dead end, no growth kinda job). Quite a few of my friends/colleagues have left the team with better job offers in hand. I am no where utilising my time or, mostly, my skills. I feel shitty.

Each day is a day of wastage. No excercise, overeating or skipping meals. Only 2 Coursera courses to keep me engaged. No social life. Fed up in the house. Yet everyone's telling me how precious these 4 months are and I shouldn't waste them. I wanted to travel elsewhere, far from home(northeast India) and stay there for 3 months. But with no job, my savings won't be enough to sail through. I don't want to borrow money from my parents and they take it on ego that I think their money is different from my money.

I need some help here. I'm pretty much going mad without venting it out to my family/anywhere. Hence I'm here.
Can you people help me. Advice. Anything at all.

Its a long post. Thank you for reading this!

1552333062,india,HackrKnownAsFullChan,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azxp53/finally_some_intelligent_discussion_of_balakot/,42,108,,,Finally some intelligent discussion of Balakot air strike by former NSA Shivshankar Menon,"Shivshankar Menon is the former NSA during the UPA, and before that foreign secretary, ambassador, etc. and also had a big influence on Indian nuclear posture, India-China relations, etc.

Basically someone really smart and who actually understands what he's talking about and can talk about it without shouting. Anyone, who's been obsessing about the Balakot air strikes (like me) should definitely watch this interview:

[Balakot And After: Assessing Gains And Risks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nX_fU6KGcA)

For TL;WD, he makes the following key points:

1. That the government needed to take this action and it has had major gains. But he says by making it a political theme, the strategic gains have been diminished. The airstrikes went from being an action that **India** undertook to impose costs on Pakistan, to becoming something *Modi* did to win elections. Menon says, the number of terrorists who died, the size of holes on the roofs, etc are totally irrelevant or only useful for political theater, the only measure of success is whether India got the outcome it wanted.

2. He has a negative view of foreign policy under Modi, they have done well with China but lost the initiative with Pakistan.

3. There should be a full spectrum of options, apart from military strikes available to deal with Pakistan including diplomacy, overt strikes, covert action, economic coercion, etc. He also implies in his book that India refrained from overt military action after Mumbai 2008, but used a broad variety of covert means inside Pakistan.

4. India should understand that Pakistan has several constituencies like common people, businessmen, civilian politicians, jihadis/Army, etc and Indian strategy should deal with each differently. Especially because many of these constituencies have aims very different from the Jihadis/Army that actively seek to harm India. By shutting down visas, trade, etc India loses ways to pressure Pak in the future.

5. Most interestingly, he says Pakistan is a strategic distraction and we shouldn't focus too much on them. Our challenges are to become a powerful country and take people out of poverty, create a developed India. He says that even when Pakistan was very successful in exporting terror to India in the 80s and 90s, India still managed to do quite well.

Basically, to treat Pakistan like a mosquito, punish it when needed but not waste too much effort on it. He also questions the entire thing about getting Masood Azhar on the UN list because it's a waste of time and energy and achieves nothing.


What I really love about this guy is that he doesn't think of short term politics and only what India (which is not Modi) should do and the direction it should take.

Interestingly, based on a reference in his book, I looked up [an interview with Manmohan Singh in 2004](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/24/opinion/IHT-indias-new-leader-singh-talks-of-peace-and-a-war-on-poverty.html), one week after he became the Prime Minister, and there you can see the strategy India followed for the next 10 years.",,azxp53,,0,,false,1560176372,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Reddiquette,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/azxp53/finally_some_intelligent_discussion_of_balakot/,,,false,[R]eddiquette,

[https://imgur.com/1rAcfKb](https://imgur.com/1rAcfKb) (pic of the dog as well as the X-ray)

Guys,  I am a member of the Society for Non-Human Persons, a body of  individuals who have come together to give a better life to the animals  on the campus of NLSIU - a prestigious law school situated in Bangalore.  I do understand that it is a *very* long shot but would like to try nonetheless.

We  have a dog on campus which was hit by a vehicle some time ago, and at  that time no one got the poor dog treated and rather just tied up the  wound to maintain pressure, unfortunately, the bones started healing in  the awkward position itself and recently the dog got ran over by a car  just outside the gate. As luck would have it, the fractured bone was  broken again and while we were able to get her to the vet asap, he  suggested that she should undergo a surgery which costs about 15k.  Adding to the problem, she is pregnant. If she does not undergo surgery,  she will be in constant pain for the rest of her life as the new  fracture is much worse and the nerves pass through the same area. We have  approached multiple shelters, pro-animal-rights organizations as well as  enthusiastic alums and while some of the extremely generous college  peeps have donated as much as they can, and so have the committee  members, we have been able to reach \~8-9k. The committee, unfortunately,  receives zero funds from the college and so can not approach the  administration for help. The surgery is to take place *tomorrow*.  While I understand financial support might not be viable, I would also  be eternally grateful to anyone who could, alternatively, foster her for a couple of  days after surgery (I will personally pay for all the medication). We have nothing from which we could possibly pay you guys back, but  words fail me when I try to describe the sheer gratitude and  indebtedness at the mere thought of any assistance in this regard.

Facebook: fb/SNHPNLS \[let me know in the comments if you require any additional proof\]

Long  time lurker, I don't care about being doxxed as I saw my pet almost  bleed to death in front of my eyes when I was \~10 and can not bear the  thought of witnessing this poor dog live a life of pain and neither can I  bear orphaning her pups.

Lots of Love &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Thank you everyone who wanted to help. I was down with dengue right after I put this up so couldn't coordinate and then forgot to update. We managed to raise 22k and got her operated at the Maruthi Pet Clinic. The pups had to be aborted, but she is fine now.

Throwaway in the off chance that someone recognizes me. 


We're a family of four. Four adults. Living in delhi.

We've sold our 3bhk flat because of the condition of the building. But now that we're out looking for a new place in our own colony we cant find anything decent in the same or similar price. 


Does it make sense to purchase a 2bhk flat thats is in better shape and then go live on rent? The rent we pay can be covered in part by the rent we receive from the flat we own. Bare in mind that despite owning a decent flat in delhi we dont have a lot of savings or cash on hand. 


I honestly dont want to live on rent, but this way we could live in a better area. I'm very confused and I need someone to talk me thru the benefits and drawbacks of doing this.

[This](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40276548?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) is the link to the paper.

TLDR:

&gt;The economist and Ambedkarite scholar Sukhdeo Thorat, and his co-author, US-based sociologist Paul Attewell, posted dummy résumés of candidates in response to advertisements for entry-level jobs in leading newspapers in the country.

&gt;For each vacancy, three résumés were sent. All the résumés were identical in almost all respects (with the same educational qualifications and suitable degrees from reputed universities) but they differed when it came to the caste and religion of the candidate. While caste and creed were not mentioned explicitly in the résumé, in each trio of résumés, one had a distinctly upper-caste surname, one a Dalit surname and one a Muslim surname.

&gt;Thorat and Attewell then analysed the response patterns from firms. Their findings, published in a 2007 Economic and Political Weekly research paper, were striking.

&gt;**The ones with Muslim surnames had the lowest chance of being selected for an interview, followed by those with Dalit surnames. Candidates with upper-caste surnames faced significantly brighter prospects.**

People say that caste based discrimination doesn't exist in India. But as someone from a low caste background I can certainly say that is far from being true.",,agigo7,,0,,false,1552653846,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Reddiquette,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/agigo7/caste_is_not_past_the_persistence_of/,,,false,[R]eddiquette,
1547650194,india,shinchan_pyara_pyara,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aglub6/change_my_view_people_speaking_against_caste/,7,0,,,Change my view: People speaking against caste based reservations don't really care if a deserving person is getting it or not.,"Whenever the issue of caste based reservations is brought up, those who oppose it argue that if this was done on the basis of economic status then they won't have a problem. Even worse some say that deserving people from lower castes don't get it because more well off people from those castes misuse them. But I think that's not the case. **The opposition against caste based reservations imo arises because of jealousy that some people are able to get into good colleges even after scoring lower marks.**

Little bit about me. I went to one of the IITs few years back and my father's annual income was less than 3 lacs then. I got a general rank but I did get a better college because of my category rank(ST). I would like to share my experiences at college. I could clearly feel the resentment some people had. My surname, which gives away my caste easily, was the culprit I feel. It wasn't difficult to spot the differences in how people behaved with me and my other ""general category"" friends despite my efforts to befriend them. This however changed over time especially when I outscored some of them. People didn't care earlier if I was poor or if I was talented. 

I feel that most people from reserved castes(not including OBCs) are actually not well off. The people who are well off are few. They are a minority. Yet caste based reservations are attacked on the basis that well off people are using it. Even in my college the same thing applied as far as I saw. There were some students in my wing that were even poorer than me and came from villages. And most of these guys couldn't even speak English well. These people will easily fall into both the categories i.e having economic disadvantage as well as caste disadvantage. Despite that I saw that these kids didn't get a lot of support from their peers. There were some people who tried to help them but a lot of the others simply mocked them behind their backs. The resentment was clear. Most of them just interacted with each other.

Another point I'd like to bring is that people usually target the SC/ST population when it comes to reservations. However I have seen that the OBC population overall is much better economically. I won't say that is always the case but on average the difference is clear. Yet people don't seem to mind OBC reservation as much as they hate SC/STs getting it.

**Unpopular opinion but I feel that there is a need why even well off people from these castes should get reservations.** I had friends who were definitely well off and better economically and who would be attacked for ""misusing"" reservations. But those were the people I usually hanged out with in my first semester. Because there was no judgement. (This improved with time as people realized that I am not as dim as they thought). Whenever a lot of people come together usually small groups of individuals are formed. The people who are affected the most in such situations are the outcastes. In the case of my college it would be the people who, according to people opposing caste based reservations, deserve reservations. But once they enter college they are completely lost.
