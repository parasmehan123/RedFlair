We don't need 33% Women's reservation in Loksabha. We need a law that mandates minimum 33% seat allocation by every political party.,14,bz5q6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bz5q6a/we_dont_need_33_womens_reservation_in_loksabha_we/,10,1560242384.0,"Yes, all we need is a law to mandate every political party (participating in more than 2 seats in a given election) to allocate 33 percent seats to women.

Two reasons for this view. 

1. Current failure of SC/ST reservation policy for Loksabha seats. As we know a total of 24.01%(131) seats are reserve to SC/ST combined. Now when this happens, all the candidates participating are from SC/ST for that seat. Hence the SC/ST votes are split. Hence, SC/ST community fails to elect a strong leader to represent them. Instead, this split vote results in victory of a candidate picked by others(Upper Castes). ([This is that reason close to 55% of reserved seats are won by BJP](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/half-of-bjps-additional-mps-from-sc/st-constituencies/articleshow/69501208.cms). Or Congress took advantage earlier). This defeats the whole purpose of reservation as it does not empower the community. If we reserve 33% seats to women, there will be similar scenario where all women are pitted against each other. The weakest one which men choose will be the one representing.
2. Success of TMC and BJD experiment in recent election. [Both parties allocated more then 33% percent seats.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tmc-fields-41-women-bjd-promises-33-will-other-political-parties-take-cue-98300) [Result is that more than 33% percent of candidates elected from these parties are women.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/42-of-bjd-mps-are-women-highest-ever-for-any-party/articleshow/69490501.cms)

This is a rant, so please bear with me.

Ever since BJP has been elected in 2014, It has been extremely controversial, due to the fact its Hindu nationalism and its controversial leaders, however many still had hopes that BJP would do good, BJP however was not as good as expected, BJP did do some good things like Sanitation, Electrification, etc. But they Started having their Negatives and they had a lot of them but Congress, Not only did they lose the elections, but the also did nothing to rebuild their party and image. Congress has done literally nothing to combat BJP, infact, they are losing badly to BJP in most fronts, Lets look at some of them -

1. Demonetisation, Congress had a wonderful opportunity to destroy BJP in the mind of common people, yet try as they might, BJP Propaganda was able to beat Congress arguments and Congress were able to do nothing.
2. Farmer Suicide, Congress again was able to not convince the majority that BJP is the cause of this and as such was not able to rally support
3. BJP was able to successfully weaken all institutions in our country and place their men in charge, while congress just sat and watched
4. Mishandling of Kashmir done by BJP as Terrorism rose by more than 200% and yet, congress did not even think of using this issue against BJP
5. Asifa Bano Case, A Horrendous where a 8 year old was raped by BJP Officials and what Congress Did, nothing, Hell they even allowed BJP to manipulate the issue into a Hindu vs Muslim issue and they did nothing for it
6. Rafale deal, Congress tried their level best to accuse BJP of Corruption, yet nothing happened, infact they spent way too much time on Rafale Deal that even the Country forgot about them

Congress is dragged down by the Gandhi Family, especially Rahul Gandhi, who really give waste Congress, Ask yourselves this, If Amit Shah was Congress President, he would have a Field Day against BJP in these issues, but these morons successfully turn a favourable situation into a unfavourable one. In fact, In both Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh, where BJP had Anti Incumbency against them, Congress still did not do as well as they could have. In Karnataka, BJP was just seats away from forming Government, due to Congress's own mismanagement in campaigning

TLDR - If Congress and BJP were Human Being and You Gave congress a Gun with six bullets and told him to shoot at BJP, he will Miss the first 5 shots and shot himself at the 6th shot, That's how incompetent Congress's right now, This Election for them is a Lost cause, they should start planning for 2024 elections",0

I myself have partaken in all of the above. 

But the way he has handled his decision in last 2 weeks, compelled me to write; that he did finally showed maturity, ownership and grace in his demeanor.

Not a pappu anymore, I feel sad for him, like he was forced to perform at something and was looked at with higher expectations. Setting him up for failure. He should have been given or he should have taken a junior ministry >cabinet post before becoming the PM candidate

Last names may always not be helpful, they can sometime lead to over expectations and set up your failure due to immense pressure it builds up!

> At Delhi's Ashoka hotel, the national convenor of the UP-based All India Muslim Majlis, Wasi Ahmad, told the SIT he had been fielding puppet candidates in state elections since 2002.

> Ahmad offered fake nominees for next year's assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.

> His bogus candidates would stand for the Rashtriya Awami Dal, another local group that he claimed to be running separately. The Rashtriya Awami Dal is designated by the election commission as a registered unrecognised party.

> Ahmad then explained privileges puppet candidates like his bring to their sponsors from their entitlements, such as permits for campaign vehicles and additional bank accounts to manipulate spending.

> The election commission has capped expenditure of candidates fighting parliamentary and assembly polls. The limits vary from state to state.

> According to the EC's online handbook for candidates, non-compliance to the ceilings could attract serious action.

> India Today's special team then met Rajesh Bharti,  president of the Swarashtra Jan Party. His group from Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh was registered in 2011.

> Bharti also offered a candidate, whose primary role would be to cut into the votes of his financer's opponents.

> ""This is also a sport for me to help someone (the sponsor) win. His victory will be mine,"" Bharti said.

> His phony candidate would participate in campaign, but with a brief to eat into the support of his sponsor's rivals.

> ""He (the puppet) will use our party flag not yours. He'll have his posters everywhere and will have car passes issued in his name. But when he will move out to campaign, he'll discretely talk to people about you. On the face of it, he'll be representing his own party,"" Bharti said.

> Thereon, India Today's crew visited Shariq Usmani, who is in charge of the Apna Desh Party's western Uttar Pradesh unit.

> Everything and anyone can be bought, he told the undercover team as he quoted a stunningly high price for his fraudulent tactics.

> If you think this is not confusing enough, Paul’s election symbol, the helicopter with its rotor blades, when seen in a smaller size could be eerily similar to the fan symbol of Jagan’s party. Add to that the fact that colours of the party flag too are similar.

> Hunting for people with the same or similar names and enticing them with money into contesting as Independents to split a rival’s votes is a dirty, old trick practised across India.

> - In Irikkur, along with Minister KC Joseph of Congress, there is a Joseph (without initials), an Independent.

> - In Kannur constituency, there are three Satheesans: Satheesan M (Congress), Satheesan P and Satheesan EV (Independents).

> - There are three Shajis in Azhikode: KM Shaji (Muslim League), Shaji KM and KM Shaji (Independents).

> - Thalassery has two Abdullakuttys (one of the Congress and one Independent) and two Sajeevans (Sajeevan VK of BJP and Sajeevan VK, Independent).

>  From political greenhorns to seasoned veterans, several candidates are depending on hired detectives for political intelligence ranging from the issues agitating the minds of the electorate to the secret strategies of their rivals and even the local leaders that can be put up as dummy candidates to split the votes and spoil the show for their opponents. 

>  With women detectives, spy cameras, recorders and other tools at their disposal, professional agencies are busy probing for potential marital discord or family dispute and even keeping an eye on the poll managers (something that Aarti Devi, too, would have benefited from).

We need some Indian shows,124,bqgkcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bqgkcw/we_need_some_indian_shows/,55,1558298902.0,"After AIB (All India Bakchod) disappeared so did it's show On Air with AIB close. On Air with AIB was a show which would depict India's recent issues with satire as well as keeping us updated with what is happening in our surroundings.

Netflix recently introduced a show [Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj](https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80239931) which talks about all various issues from Immigration issues to the Deforestation in Brazil but the show is more America centered (the jokes in particular, those who have watched his shows may get what I mean). He even has an episode about [Indian Elections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqZ_SH9N3Xo) . The point i'm trying to make here is that we need shows like these for us Indians where issues can directly be addressed while at the same time comedy and satire can be used. Shows like this will educate us about our current affairs as well as give us a good laugh. If this somehow reaches our famous OTT's like Hotstar or MX Player or even Netflix I hope they create an Indian satire show that would keep us updated of the issues and events around us.

P.S. - Comedy Nights with Kapil and many more are satirical shows but the post is not about that.

**Tl;Dr We need to get our OTT players to create shows for their Indian audience that would be satirical at the same time keep us updated with the headlines of the news.**

>	An investigation by Cobrapost has exposed 36 Bollywood celebrities ready to promote a political party for money by posting favourable messages on their social media accounts to help create a favorable environment in the run-up to 2019 elections. Among these celebs are actors, singers, stand-up comedians and dancers: Noted playback singers, Abhijeet Bhattacharya, Kailash Kher, Mika Singh and Baba Sehgal; actors Jackie Shroff, Shakti Kapoor, Vivek Oberoi, Sonu Sood, Amisha Patel, Mahima Chaudhry, Shreyas Talpade, Puneet Issar, Surendra Pal, Pankaj Dheer and his son Nikitin Dheer, Tisca Chopra, Deepshikha Nagpal, Akhilendra Mishra, Rohit Roy, Rahul Bhat, Salim Zaidi, Rakhi Sawant, Aman Verma, Hiten Tejwani and spouse Gauri Pradhan, Evelyn Sharma, Minissha Lamba, Koena Mitra, Poonam Pandey, Sunny Leonne; comedians Raju Srivastava, Sunil Pal, Rajpal Yadav, Upasana Singh, Krushna Abhishek and Vijay Ishwarlal Pawar; and choreographer Ganesh Acharya and dancer Sambhavana Seth. This is almost who’s who of the entertainment industry, both film and TV.

>	While we saw all these celebs succumbing to the lure of money and agreeing to indulge in this unethical and unlawful practice, there were some notable exceptions, though. When we approached Vidya Balan, Arshad Warsi, Raza Murad and Saumya Tandon with our proposition, these celebs chose to go by their conscience and straightaway refused to play ball.",0

                                     -Master Zafar.
I was reading an [article](https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge/features/elections-2019-the-ordinary-world-of-kanhaiya-kumar-1556255953373.html) about Kanhiya Kumar and this quote above resonated in me alot. I am the same age as Kanhiya working in a Corporate company, and i feel that what Kanhiya has done is to set an example on how to fight the MAN. He was accused, jailed, beaten, harassed, and humiliated. But all he did was keep standing up after being beaten to the ground with false accusation and intimidation. What was happening to Kanhiya is what happens to anyone who questions authority, and when I say authority i mean in bosses, government, police, RWA members, some old guy in your neighborhood. These people abuse their powers and try every trick in the book to attack you. I have faced these type of people myself and I can guarantee you this that if you stand up and fight you will win, but only if you hold that person responsible. 

Kanhiya Kumar is not only a resistance movement symbol but a symbol of how to respond to authorities. I have seen many leaders but this one stands out. Because he stood against such injustice and attack by the current government and started to rally the masses against the injustice of the government. 

 He not only is able to condense the most complex political issue into a beautiful explanation that everyone understands but is also able to connect with the people listening to him. He says the right things at the right time but can't say if he will be able to survive in that cesspool of hyenas in parliament. But, I am excited to see if he is going to make waves in the parliament or not. 

Warning to all, A citizen is not a politician, a politician is never a citizen. Always hold your politicians accountable and answerable. don not in any circumstances become a **political fanboi**.

"[Political] If you want to see content that exposes and explains the political atrocities of the recent past, watch 'Shut up ya Kunal' by Kunal Kamra.",9,biugvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/biugvm/political_if_you_want_to_see_content_that_exposes/,5,1556599330.0,"I've been a fan of Kunal Kamra's comedy for quite some time now. But I recently discovered his show where he invites political spokespersons/commentators/analysts to break down the problems with the state of Indian politics. 

His guests are well picked and mostly knowledgeable and the analysis is done in Kamra's usual piercing humourous manner. If you want a clearer view of what goes on behind the scenes or rather the hidden hypocrisies of parties and leaders, the show is a must watch. 

Again as is true with everything, there is a certain amount covering up and misguiding done by the participants, but it's mostly unbiased (atleast more than usual). Kamra doesn't spare his guests either as the interviews are interlaced with videos/images/statistics highlighting their hypocrisy at times. 

I'm including the links to some of my favourite episodes. Keep an open mind and it will definitely be a eye opening experience. 

[Ravish Kumar (Journalist) one of the very few ones still having the courage to tackle the government openly. He explains the deteriorated state of the Indian media in the past few years.  ](https://youtu.be/stNh_di8OM8)

[Javed Akhtar (Bollywood veteran) and Yogendra Yadav (Political activist/analyst). They talk about the rise of communalism and hatred contrasting today's state with conditions when they were growing up. Interesting conversation with some good examples. ](https://youtu.be/ZZCr0ypso6Q)

[Shweta Shalini (BJP Spokesperson) and Atishi (AAP).  Kamra questions various moves and policies of their respective parties and highlights the hypocrisy very clearly. This one is also just pure entertainment due to elaborate lies and covering done by the guests. (Mostly Shweta)](https://youtu.be/72kwFyLT8wI)

[Owaisi (AIMIM President). I'm conflicted over this because it does show Owaisi's hitherto hidden side. But you can also see him avoiding tricky questions. Overall good episode to gain extra perspective. ](https://youtu.be/2HMVMivv4A8)",0

"The very definition of an anti-national, according to BJP candidate Tejasvi Surya",131,bf1iv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bf1iv0/the_very_definition_of_an_antinational_according/,61,1555722169.0,"So Tejasvi Surya (the chud contesting from South Bangalore who's been doing the rounds lately on Twitter and elsewhere after being lauded by Modi and some other top BJP leaders for being the most intelligent young patriotic Indian ladka) had come to my college as part of his campaign. The 5 minutes that I listened to him talk honestly included some of the most cringeworthy and moronic things I've probably ever heard

One of the things that he said was that ""Youngsters criticizing elder BJP statesmen like Modiji"" are by definition, ""anti-nationals"", because the latter have been Indian ""nationals"" since before they were born.
He also said India is going to be in the top 3 biggest economies by 2023 if BJP was voted to power. 

In response to a girl asking him about the lowly 140th place given to India for press freedom and one of the worst scores for human rights in 2017, he said ""We very well know how international institutions have become blatantly anti-hindu and anti-India over the recent years"" and that we may not take their word for it and ended the Q&A segment right after (I'm paraphrasing some parts). 

Also there were instances of him failing to strike seemingly obvious applause lines and would just wait for applause but with very little reaction from the crowd for the first few seconds after which the teachers and others would gradually clap on cue. Like I mentioned, absolute cringefest

The week in which his talk was supposed to be scheduled was also the week of my department fest wherein students and teachers were told to wear a specific colour of clothing for each day of the 5 day fest. And conveniently enough the color assigned on that day was orange and all the teachers wore bright orange silk sarees and they had a bunch of cameramen lurking around at all four corners of the auditorium

The Bloody Cost Of Political Capital,81,avh6sf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/avh6sf/the_bloody_cost_of_political_capital/,20,1551323834.0,"With the news of [Amit Shah trying to grab votes on the back of the Balakot Strike](https://thewire.in/politics/amit-shah-uses-indian-airstrikes-to-appeal-to-voters-in-ups-ghazipur), I decided to share the following essay on the current administration's short-sighted machinations.

I don't condemn military action. I feel that any military strike with a clear strategic goal is an essential tool in a Nation's foreign policy toolbox. I am not averse to ""surgical strikes"" or raids provided the goals are clearly outlined and there is net positive outcome. 

I do however take umbrage when the actions of our Armed Forces are traded  in for cheap, short-term political capital. This is what I feel has happened in the last two days. 

The Balakot ""Pre-emptive"" attack is an albatross around Modi's neck. What should've been a low profile, covert operation was paraded in front of the wolfish Indian media. It was a blatant effort to save face, to live up to a manufactured image in the eyes of the Indian public which was enraged - rightly so - at the catastrophic loss of 40 CRPF Jawans in the Pulwama attack. 

In doing so, India lost sight of WHY such strikes are conducted and why they need to be covert actions. 

Pakistan is not a homogeneous whole - a singular entity of evil. It's a nation which is under Military rule at every possible level. The Pakistani military's raison d'etre is Indian aggression - perceived and real both. 

The Pakistani Military and 'Deep State' can only maintain control if there is a credible and immediate threat to Pakistan from India. Through proxy warfare and supporting sub-versive, terrorist elements in J&K they are assured that India reacts predictably to any major attacks - derail peace talks, incite Indian military action and retain a stranglehold through panic and fear-mongering.

The Balakot air-strikes ignored the above and the Indian Civil Leadership in typically short-sighted manner failed to account for the fact that if you challenge the Pakistani Military Leadership or Sovereignty in such a blase manner then there will be fallout which cannot be favourable. 

What bothers me to no end is the absolute lack of strategic vision the current Govt. has showcased by choosing to thump-chests and be overt about their ""strong"" retaliation. 

A covert, plausibly deniable attack on the same target - I have serious doubts that the air strikes cause 300 casualties - would sidestep a direct challenge to the Pakistani Military and Deep State actors. It wouldn't pressurize them to the brink of conducting air-strikes on their own. Things can spiral out of control within hours.

When you deploy Strike Aircraft you have increased the chances of escalation by a considerable amount. If you then brag about it in the news the next day, those chances shoot up to a 100%.

Net outcome - A Mig-21 lost, no confirmed effect on target and an IAF Wing Commander captured by the Pakistani Armed Forces. India and Pakistan reach to new heights of aggression and this further exacerbates our divide.

A covert strike via submarine launched cruise missiles or even an airstrike minus the flag waving and nose-thumbing would've lead to a far more favourable strategic outcome in the long run. But the Armed Forces of both Nations pay a bloody price for political equity.

At the end of the day, the posturing and hate-mongering confuses and obfuscates. It calls for escalation on both sides. More importantly, for India, it drops a smoke screen on the most critical issue:

Jammu and Kashmir

The political leadership should realize that at the end of the day this is an INTERNAL SECURITY problem. Foreign actors are only able to 'act' because the environment is conducive to such activities.

We cannot and should not fail the state and people of J&K. Amidst the war-mongering and cries for revenge it's imperative to realize that we have an insurgency on our hands and this needs CIVIC ACTION to go along with Military raids. 

Until we nip the insurgency in the bud by serious socio-political efforts to improve the quality of life for the average Kashmiri it will be extremely easy for Pakistan or any foreign entity for that matter, to foment terrorist acts. It's not enough to conduct surgical strikes, until We look inwards and start from there, we cannot achieve long lasting stability. It's not going to be easy, counter-insurgency never is - it's messy and drags on...but it can be done.

Senseless Pakistan bashing, War mongering and most importantly...the manipulation of information and military operations for short term, selfish political gain is going to be a bane for the internal security situation of India. 

tl:dr

Balakot Strike was leveraged for winning an election - this fucking sucks and is unacceptable. ",0

When we tested Agni 5 in 2012 it was a huge deal. All leading international media covered it with great importance. It was after all an ICBM. I even saw its coverage on US tv, and they rarely show anything related to India. But it wasn't a political issue back then. The govt didn't try to claim credit or blame previous govts. Now we are in a situation where every damn thing is made political. The govt has obvious plants (like the former ISRO chairman who is tainted and joined BJP to prevent arrest) who are assigned to blame the previous govt. I mean what if UPA didn't want to test ASAT. There could be any number of reason. Honestly it's not that important from national security POV and we knew that we already had the capability if needed. Testing ICBM Agni 5 was a much bigger deal as for the first time we were able to cover all of China with it. But I can't remember anyone chest thumping over it. I honestly don't know where we are going as a nation. Modi has set a very dangerous precedent here. No previous govt played with national security issues like this. If we're being objective, Pakistan actually came out with an upper hand after Pulwama and the ensuing air battle. We have never lost a perception battle to Pakistan before this. Can you imagine the chest thumping if Modi had executed something like Siachen? I am just sick of all of this. And these are just a few examples, they have been doing this from day 1. 

Rant over. Sorry.

https://indianexpress.com/article/india/terror-biggest-threat-global-summit-leaders-combat-pm-modi-maldives-china-indian-ocean-5771550/

And it seemed odd that Modi compared terrorism to climate change. My gut says that climate change is a much larger threat than terrorism, but how do the number of people who are affected by both actually compare? If you look at the number of floods, draughts and famines caused by climate change, and see how many people are affected by that and compare that to the number of people affected by terrorist activities, are the two close? Doesn't feel like they would be, but I could be wrong

Would love to hear your take on this

Edit: Would like to clarify that I'm not denying that terrorism isn't a threat. I just feel like it's not as big a priority as climate change",0

The sad part was the kind of questions that were being asked to him. One of the question was (I'm not kidding) regarding his relation with his sister, asking him how close are they?

I don't think we are asking the right questions and that's why we're being manipulated. The people are not even aware of the responsibility that this election entails them and that's the saddest part. We might be literate But I think we were more involved in out polity in 1947 than we're now. 

We should try to introduce a platform of debate similar on the lines of Presidential debate in US.

[Non-Political][Serious]: What's your thoughts on GST now?,38,6izxwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6izxwj/nonpoliticalserious_whats_your_thoughts_on_gst_now/,10,1498235539.0,"1st of all; I'm not looking for political circle-jerking. I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.

I think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I’m wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.


* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.


* I think it doesn’t solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn’t pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.

* It’s far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. “Given the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.

* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.

* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.

* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.

Last month there was a series of deductions from my balance amount for the so called VAS, none for which I have requested. Activation of VAS went on for 3 weeks in which.I lost amount 5 to 9 rupees and each happens on a day to day basis. I was refunded the first two times. But, as it started happening on a daily basis, I was denied access to  their customer  care dept.( It was denied because, i was able to connect them through other Vodafone numbers)

 I took resort in Twitter and contacted them . They did reply instantly with a message that their executive will be calling as soon as possible. None of those people called. ( I continued pestering them for two days, still those hyprocrites were in connivance).
Only after emailing and doing MNP message , i got calls from Vodafone to ask why i did the MNP messages.( they wanted to know what made me to port from their network [and after all these calls and tweets] SMH).  They did refund ,but only after 2 emails, 10 tweets, and 3 calls from another number.

So , that was last month. Yesterday , I unknowingly used up my 1 GB data pack along with my remaining balance . As usual, I proceeded to recharge through Paytm. Surprise!!! processing failed!! one, two, three, leave it,  six times, the processing failed. Tried with the Vodafone App, nope!! all the tranaction pages starting showing 'Request page cannot be processed ' messages( data packs can be activated  but no talktime ones)Tried calling their customer care, again surprise!! call doesnt go through.

Has anyone got any idea why those hypocrites are doing this to me. Is there any way I can sue them for my hassles?

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

How do I convey that I am more than that piece of paper? How much should I keep to myself?

.


I'm not too artsy, so how fancy should my portfolio look? Is a simple, plain, printed text sheet enough? (I'm really good at editing though, so I can handle digital stuff well)

.


How much weightage do my board marks carry? I scored well in 10th and stayed afloat in 11th and 12th. I'm hoping that my 12th boards will be reflective of my intellectual value, so I'd also like to know which standard is looked at more specifically or if it's looked at as a learning curve.

.


I might ask more questions later, so I'd love it if you could answer. Nonetheless, thank you so much for reading this anyway.",1

You can find the source by copy pasting some text from below and googling.

> I am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluation..there are few things u must know...
> 
> 1. GGSIPU pays Rs. 25 per answer book ....in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes Rs750/-  for evaluating one bundle....GGSIPU norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundle....so in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundles.....which makes a total earning of Rs.1500/- per day + a conveance of Rs.600/- per day making the total amount = Rs. 2100/-.
> Now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final year.....now actually what happens is....an evaluator reaches centre A at 9:30 am and get a bundle issued which he/she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hours...so they leave that bundle there and rush too the B centre and get another bundle issued there at 11:00  they check it by 12:00 now they rush back to centre A to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued there....the same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning Rs. 4200/- a day instead of Rs. 2100/-  a day..
> now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutes.....coz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marks....and all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books. This is done by around 20 % evaluators who comes for evaluation.
> 
> 2. To be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semester.....this form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution also......now the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjects....now imagine four subject for centre A and four subject for centre B which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjects...coz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued....
> 
> 3. Approx. 80 % of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solution.....they are just giving average marks.....that is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams.
> 
> 4. Most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluation....the people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between Rs.20,000/ to Rs. 30,000/- as salary from there parent college....so they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra money.....just imagine that there are evaluators who earn around Rs. 50,000/ or even more during evaluation......this should explain most of the reasons....
> 
> 5. The fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books....90% of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with it....so until the university takes some serious counter measures .....this will continue to happen.....

I work at an American tech company (Indian coworkers not surprising). I'm pretty sure she is Indian Indian (not American Indian) based on her style of dress -- so very likely either she moved here for a job or went to grad school here and accepted a job here and stayed (which seems to be a common scenario amongst many Indian tech workers).

She does this really unusual thing where she goes to the break room, drinks water from a new cup, then throws it into the trash (somewhat dramatically) -- wasting a perfectly clean styrofoam cup that's only had water in it. (Which I consider very wasteful -- it's a styrofoam cup and it's non-biodegradable). It seems a little unusual, but I’m not sure, it could be normal behavior where she comes from.

Though…

My feelings certainly wouldn't be hurt if she wasn't interested. The only reason why I feel the need to approach is because when I first started working at this company there was a lot of eye contact (her fault -- my fault -- IDK). And I have been getting the distinctive feeling that she'd like me to talk to her (though I'm not really sure).

So, what's an acceptable way to start a conversation with an Indian women? From reading about India on reddit and elsewhere, I've heard the culture is very chauvinistic, and that women shouldn't walk alone at night, and that generally woman are off limits in most cases. I’ve heard this from both non-Indians and Indians. And also heard that relationships between men and woman are usually arranged by their parents (and I think Gandhi practiced this, though I don't think it's common practice today) – and so maybe this is why there are no acceptable ways of approaching females.

I’m not trying to be offensive and I don’t’ mean to sound ignorant – but I feel like this is the only way to really gather acceptable cultural practices – through word-of-mouth and anecdotal, folk experiences. 

I'm only asking what's an acceptable way of approaching (as in starting a conversation) with an Indian female -- that could possibly be romantic in nature (I hate saying this..), but without any possibility of coming of as offensive, or as harassment, or in anyway seeming as ""negative"" in intentions.",1

I want to experience India as a country; culture, food, people etc. But one of my main plans is to find a good place for yoga. Ideally I would find an ashram where I could stay for 2-3 months. Maybe, if it's possible I would like to do a teacher training course, mainly because I want to deepen my own practice but maybe, some day, I could be interested in teaching.

BUT when I try to find places online it is really hard to determine the quality of the courses and, of course, I do not like being ripped of/wasting my time.

As I understand there are many places in India for yoga. Rishikesh, Varanasi, Mysore are the main ones that I have come upon.

I almost decided on not booking anything in advance and then travelling to a yoga city to find a course.

In this regard, do you have any advice? Cities? Specific ashrams? Ways to approach this?

I have tried in /r/yoga . I have tried different yoga forums. I have tried google. All without much result.

I really appreciate your help.",1

[Non-Political] Update: Udta Punjab - CBFC issue.,5,4n477u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4n477u/nonpolitical_update_udta_punjab_cbfc_issue/,6,1465407405.0,"The issue has just taken an interesting turn. 

1. Anurag Kashyap (AK) had apparently alleged yesterday that Pahlaj Nihalani (PN) & Co. had not given them their decision including the list of required cuts in writing. PN just said in an interview that AK & Co. were scheduled to collect it yesterday (June 7) morning. However, they did not do so and later in the day went to the media and said that CBFC had not given them the certificate. Now, the same has been collected by them today.

2. AK said that CBFC ordered them to remove 'Punjab' from the film title. PN says they never asked AK & Co. to change the film title and that AK is only doing that for publicity. 

And now for some extremely shoddy reporting from India Today (IT) (which I had some respect for before today):

A. PN specifically said in the interview (which IT showed like a hundred times continuously like every Indian news channel always does) that during his tenure, 72% of the films have been allowed without any cuts. India Today reported that PN claims that CBFC has approved 72% of Udta Punjab.

B. AK had made some wild allegations against PN including stating that he (PN) was a megalomaniac. PN unequivocally stated that he hasn't met AK after Bombay Velvet. IT, grossly twisting this, reports (quoting PN) that PN has NEVER met AK.

Now, yesterday, I was insanely furious against PN & Co. after watching my favourite director's (AK, not PN) passionate appeal in the interview. However, if I had watched only IT reports without having seen the interview, I would be fully pissed and transform into my keyboard-warrior mode against PN & Co. However, the shoddy reporting by IT makes me a bit skeptical about how much of this whole story, as portrayed by AK & Co. and the reporting by IT (usually), is exactly as true as they say it is.",1

In India, it takes a lot of guts to take up what you love and pursue it as a career because our parents love us too much to make some risky decisions. 

I am 21 years old now all I did was to follow the path showed by my parents. I never got to know what I love because I didn't there were many options in this world. All I knew was if you want to live a life decently you have to do an engineering job and get a job in a government organisation. 

Engineering opens your doors to the world it shows the all those things you left behind. It starts throwing things at your face saying ""You could have been a lawyer, you could have been an artist, you could have been an artist, blah blah"".With all these revelations about the world, I continued my engineering. I broke my heart, I became a writer, I became a poet, I tried everything in the last 3 years but I couldn't find something which I can hold on to or I can pursue it as a career. Engineering has something for me, it took time but it finally entered into my lazy life.

It took me off my legs, I suddenly felt this is something I can fight for, this is something I can think about all the time, this is the something for which I can wake up at sleep at 5 am daily, this was something I could do all the day and not get bored. 

I started working for The Monologue, NO NO, I don't work for The Monologue, it is something more than it. The Monologue is a platform for storytellers, poets and musicians in Gujarat, India. We are just a group of 7 engineers who have been working in and out al the day just one goal to become the best at what we do. One day I hope that we become the best at what we do.

Most of our parents don't know what we are doing or don't feel that it is a potential career to pursue to live a decent life. I hope one day we prove them wrong too.  

I told you this story because I am the guy who looks after the marketing of The Monologue. I stumbled upon a seminar of Seth Godin(I totally love his ideas on how the world and marketing should be) which can totally turn around the way I see things BUT that costs $745(huge money for an engineering student studying in India). So, I thought maybe someone can help with that kind of, but it doesn't matter now(You read this story that is enough for me). just follow us on Facebook or Instagram search for "" Themonologuein"" that will mean the world to me.

P.S: One day we will host an event in your city ",1

I contacted Amazon about the issues I’ve had with Bluedart and how I was going to end up disappointed with my first Amazon.in purchase. I was pleasantly surprised when I got a reply in a few hours (way before their 24 hour wait period for emails). They promised me that the couriering will complete in time and they will prevent any such issues from happening again.

I ended up getting two Bluedart and one Fedex package in the next couple days. This is the *first time* that Bluedart has been able to “find” my address, LOL!

Let me also add, this Amazon email I got as a reply was one of those rare customer service emails that didn't sound self-defensive but really genuine and helpful—when something wrong was pointed out against the company.

Thanks for your thoughts in the previous post, guys.

These are some uninspiring thoughts when we have poured in years of work to learn, unlearn, build, dismantle, and assemble again. 

Some jumping ship, some hanging around fighting for the cause; begging, borrowing, appropriating, somehow, you do everything to never let doubts creep into your mind. 

Some nights are spent, staring at a blank screen, unresponsive code, a sad prototype of the dream that you chase.

Some days are spent, evaluating yourself, if the sum total of your life was a failure that was staring you in the face each day, each night. Your self-worth becomes zero, you become completely undesirable to people who probably loved you once, you have already jerked off to all the porn that you could handle.

By this time, all your friends have become your creditors, with lines of credits exhausted, you scroll your contact list constantly to find that one person, not to seek funds, but to talk with.
We try to hark back for simpler times, reminiscence the moments that made us laugh, then, but we hope probably it would bring an honest smile to our face – our smiles that we had pawned off we did not know when, to users, downloads, sessions and GMVs.

Then one day, you come home, stare at the blank screen, try to make sense of things, break down, and just before letting go of everything seems like an option. You think of Ali, you think of Lincoln, you seek wisdom in the hymns of Nanak, and sagacity and enlightenment from Bhagvad Gita; but you know who comes to your rescue, Earnest Hemingway.

*You are not made for defeat, you can be destroyed, but not defeated.*

To further (mis)quote Hemingway, sometimes our actions are not immediately discernible and when we try for something beyond attainment, something that has never been done, and things that others have tried and failed, and perhaps with ‘karma’ you will succeed.

Indian Media Industry [Non Political],1,2n5ntn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2n5ntn/indian_media_industry_non_political/,4,1416765854.0,"Hey /r/india, long time lurker, first time poster (1st generation American desi btw). I'm writing an analysis on India's media industry (for an International Marketing class) and wanted to get some pointers on where to start: The purpose of my paper is to basically dissect the industry and then make hypothetical recommendations to a company currently operating in the country. Some of the subtopics I am most curious about are:

1) radio broadcast in India (popularity/demographics of listeners, types of shows, are they generally profitable? Does the Indian listener prefer Desi music or a wider variety?)

2) music industry: It is common knowledge that the most popular music is likely associated to Bollywood, but I wanted to know if there was an independent music culture as well? How do musicians typically make music outside of the film industry?

3) what kinds of TV shows are most popular? What American shows are popular in India? Are soaps/serials popular amongst the youth? How is Aamir Khan's satyamev jayate amongst the youth? Are there other similar shows as such?

4) Networks: what are some of the powerhouse network companies? what networks are popular amongst young adults?

5) News. how do young adults get their information in India? what news channels are popular/reliable?

6) Do young folk read the newspapers?

If there's anything you personally find interesting about the industry, I would love to hear it! Thanks for the help, this is the brainstorming session for what I hope becomes an interesting paper. Thanks in advance!

"Hinduism, conversion and the neutrality of the Indian Secular State: a non-political, theological exploration",1,2qlsrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2qlsrb/hinduism_conversion_and_the_neutrality_of_the/,9,1419784511.0,"tl;dr:

* Pagan traditions and Semitic religions are fundamentally different manifestations of religiosity. 

*  Traditions are difficult to proselytize because they do not consider other traditions as false. 

* Semitic religions believe that some religions are indeed false and so encourage and facilitate conversion. 

* The Indian state sees Hinduism as just another semitic religion. 

* The Indian state by allowing conversion is working within a Christian theological framework. It is not being neutral.  



Full length:

In India, we have two different kinds of religions: Pagan or Dharmic or Indic traditions (Hindu, Jain and Buddhist traditions) and Semitic or Abrahamic religions (Islam and Christianity). 

Hindu traditions exist because they are passed down from one generation to the other. Such traditions do not actively seek converts because they do not entertain the notion that other people follow false gods or have false religions. 

Such traditions see things like devas or puja pr bhakti as familial or traditional practices. They are followed in order to maintain some continuity between different generations, not because they contain some grand and timeless truth. The practioners of such traditions might try to justify their actions (a Durga bhakt would say that she is worshiped because she killed a powerful demon).  Such justifications are mostly offered to outsiders (non-bhakts or non-hindus) and are not theologically consistent. 

Observing ancestral practices need not be justified logically just as there is nothing logical about writing a sonnet using just 14 lines. Why 14? Its just tradition. There is nothing scientific or logical about it. 

 Semitic religions (namely Islam and Christianity) spread partly as ancestral practices and partly through conversion.

 Islamic and Christian theologians try (not always successfully of course) to be logically consistent because they  think that they are after some grand and timeless truth. Using the God-given faculty of Reason, they want to understand the nature of Creation and the Creator. Conversion makes sense to Muslims and Christians because they think there are false religions and false gods. And the people who worship such false gods will be punished after they die by the True God. To save the “heathen”, Muslims and Christians are encouraged to engage in proselytization and conversion. 

The heathen needs to be saved from his own spiritual blindness.
 

Indian secularism is defined as equal respect and equidistance from all religions. The secular state sees Hinduism as just another Semitic religion with an internally consistent theology containing a singular grand Truth. So a Brahmin is just another kind of Priest, and Gita another kind of “religious” text like the Quran. Having confused tradition with religion, the Indian state allows for proselytization thinking that it is possible to convert people from one tradition to the other. 


By allowing proselytization and conversion, the Indian state has accepted that:

1.	There are some True gods and some False  gods.
2.	It is possible and necessary and understandable that people can be “saved” from eternal damnation for worshiping false gods. 
3.	Hindu traditions can compete financially and theologically in the “marketplace of damned souls” on a level footing with Islam and Christianity.
  
None of the above statements holds up to  **neutral scientific scrutiny** . Do humans have souls? Can souls be damned? Are there True and False gods? Do Islam and Christianity contain some timeless truth? 

Within the framework of Hindu “theology”, the notions that there are false gods and that you can be punished for worshiping such goads do not make sense.

However, all of the above statements make sense within the framework of Christian theology. 

Faced with two completely contradictory theoretical positions (there are some false gods and there are no false gods), the Indian state cannot be neutral. It either allows conversion (as it has done for the past 60yrs) and accepts the semitic notion of false gods, heathens etc or it bans conversion and gives undue advantage to pagan traditions. 

Faced with two very different kinds of religions, the Indian state cannot afford to be equidistant or show equal respect.

"[serious] [reddiquette] [askindia] March End woes, questions regarding rent receipt submission and taxation and legalities.",5,b6uzbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b6uzbt/serious_reddiquette_askindia_march_end_woes/,0,1553879497.0,"Hello r/india! I have been living in a non-metro city for past few years and recently shifted jobs (Company A and B) and houses (House H1 and H2) both.

**Backstory:**

Concerned apartment (and other unknown businesses) is/are owned by a lady ""F"", whose husband ""M"" holds an ""Irrevocable Power of Attorney"" for all things owned/operated/etc by F. Account provided to me to transfer rent every month belongs to daughter ""D"" (no idea if it is joint account). M had sent me his HUF PAN card photo before the agreement was done.

Due to some issues, broker who showed the flat was out of picture during actual registration of agreement - which happened at sub-registrar's office and not online. M was never asked to submit his individual PAN or even present F's PAN.

All rent transfers were always online (IMPS or NEFT) from the my same account to the provided D's account.

**Actual Issue:**

From April 2017 to March 2019, I have been staying at the H1. The rent was initially little less than 14k and then after 11 months, me and my owner mutually agreed to extend the agreement (over a phone call), in which he also proposed an increase in rent of rupees 1000/-. Later, in a next call few days later, he asked me to 'pay rounded amount' as the rent which was exact 15k. I obliged to his terms all the times.

Now, when in January 2018, I had asked him for PAN, he said he'll talk to his lawyer and decide. Later, he declined giving it to me. Because I was not in any taxable slab, CA at company A only showed <1 lacs as rent paid and it was fine. This CA was not fine with M's HUF PAN as owner's PAN.

Coming to January 2019, I was confident owner would not provide PAN but still gave a call and to my surprise he said yes. He kept on prolonging actually giving it to me citing ""TDS would be cut"". I told him he's a Self Employed person, so no one is going to cut TDS from him. He still never gave it. LOL. So even for FY18-19, CA at company A used 8000/- as rent paid every month as I was still out of tax slabs (submitted original agreement copy and bank statement - was never asked to submit rent receipts, and no PAN was submitted here).

End on Jan, I switched jobs. Company B CA did not have a problem with HUF PAN and asked me to submit rent receipts with HUF PAN mentioned. Also, when I explained him the scenario, he asked me to address rent receipts to ""M"" instead of ""F"" as I had previously done.

Rent for H1 has been paid until March 2019, but I shifted to H2 (rent 22k) around mid March and paid equivalent rent there too. H2 has a registered agreement from March 2019 which allowed me to shift mid month because of an emergency.

**Important Note:**

I don't care how M or F move their money around (may be in millions, has political family and is from rural west MH).
All I care is saving my money and not paying his taxes - now that I am taxable. And not legally implicated.

**Questions:**

1. Whose PAN should actually have been provided/asked by me during registration of agreement?
2. Submitting rent receipts for first time: Legal issues for forging M's signature (for actual rent paid as he would never give signature voluntarily)?
3. Given that actual registered agreement period was over after 11 months but I was actually staying there for 13 months more and paying electricity bills and rents (all online) prove I was still a resident at the flat?

Question 3 assumes that I get IT query after owner declares signatures forged, declines I was resident or paid rent for period after agreement.

Thanks to all for your time and help.

TLDR: Verbally extended rental agreement has no PAN as owner/attorney does not wish to provide it. Forging signature on receipts for actual rent paid online every time. Implications?",2

While reddit is great for asking question on various communities, quora is the only place where I can get unironic answers for my questions related to various exams conducted in India. 


But what is up with these Indian quora users? Do they really think that giving a really long answer would make up for the lack of attention they received from the opposite gender in their school college. What is inhibiting them from giving a straight and concise answer to simple straight forward question. 


Now I know that there are quorans who wave around their degrees from IITs and IIMs, but truth be told, rarely I have seen an IIM grad irl who gives such long and lofty answer to anything. They keep it short and simple. The same cannot be said about IITians. Yes I know you worked hard to get where you are, but you don't have to rub it in on someone who doesn't care about your degree and is just here for clearing something up.

Coming back to the rant, does every answer need to be an essay on your life? Also, if I am asking an insightful/technical question of which I happen to know somethings  I am really interested in what I asked. I don't want the googled textbook definition  that you ripped off from a website to sound smart and I certainly don't need all the background information on the topic. For example, I recently came across a question asking if Arnab Goswami is a liberal or conservative. Now this randi quoran gave a 200 word explanation on what it means to be a liberal and a conservative. And then went on to the function of the government. In the final sentence was his answer. THE  ANSWER NEEDED WAS JUST ONE SENTENCE and he wrote 500 word essay. 


Also, the whole of quora is the r/askreddit sub. All the question that get answered are the questions which have nothing insightful.  I remember asking a question about the Rakhine situation, and ended up getting answers from an extremely xenophobic dude, who ranted how all bangladeshis should be killed who come to India. I mean dude, can you even read. I just asked why Myanmar refused to accept Rohingya as it's residents.


Also, what is up with these teenagers giving out life lessons?  They are 18 ffs. They have barely even experienced it. 

Tl:dr; Rants of a madman on quora users. I know there are subreddits such as r/indianpeoplequora and r/rant , however I chose this subreddit since the people at r/rant won't get what I am on about and it isn't exacty r/indianpeoplequora material.",2

[Np] Reddiquette. You Should Know : The largest combined arms operation after WW2 that resulted in the largest number of prisoners gained after WW2. India's brilliant victory in the 1971 war.,159,2dbsis,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2dbsis/np_reddiquette_you_should_know_the_largest/,107,1407872937.0,"The Indian victory against Pakistan in 1971 was one of the greatest examples of operational art and the largest combined arms operation after World War 2. It was a masterpiece of Political objective, Strategic vision, operational planning and tactical execution.


It is important to understand why it was seen as such a great victory. Warfare is usually divided into Positional attrition warfare (think World War 1, Iran-Iraq war or even the India-China war / India-Pakistan war of 1965) or maneuver driven situational warfare. The concept of maneuver warfare was propounded (at around the same time) by various European warfare experts, B.H.Liddel Hart (England) and Mikail Tucahavesky (shot dead by Stalin, and one of THE finest military minds the world has ever seen) was it’s greatest exponent. His theory was, 


Attack on a broad front > use air superiority and arty to make holes in the enemy line > Use this penetration to feed in highly mobile troops who would use maneuver to keep the enemy off balance. The Positional warfare suggests that you can win a war only by crushing the enemies main point of defense (mostly frontally – the British were a firm believer in this theory) while indirect / maneuver warfare suggests that you avoid the strong points, and hit the vulnerable rear of the enemy, keep him off balance, deny him his CCI structure and win the war by using terrain and encirclement (read up on Cannae or Kharkov / Smolensk for examples of encirclement warfare) .


India which had favoured the first theory in all it’s wars till then used the second theory to great effect.


**The Planning:**


In March 1971, Indira Gandhi came back to power with a resounding mandate, and was faced with an immediate crisis! The Bangladeshi refugee problem. A genocide in East Pakistan (estimated deaths vary from 3 million to 4 million) was pushing a massive amount of refugees into India. Her cabinet (especially Defence minister Jagjivan Ram) favoured immediate invasion to settle this crisis and to discuss this, she summoned the CoAS – Sam ‘Bahadur’ Manekshaw. In a very interesting and stormy meeting, she told him to prepare for an invasion of East Pakistan.  Sam Bahadur point blank refused to entertain this and offered to resign straight away. Indira who was used to getting her way, did not like this resistance but asked her advisors to leave the room and had Manekshaw speak his mind freely. He laid down three reasons why he preferred an invasion in the closing months of the year. In this he was going against both Jagjivan Ram and Indira Gandhi  and he was aware of this, but he refused to be a party to a botched up invasion.


•	The Passes with China would be closed because of snow, making it difficult for the Chinese to intervene. In June (when Indira was asking him to invade) the passes would be clear and would need a diversion of efforts to defend these.

•	Monsoon (in this he was proven very right) and the resulting quagmire. The Russian word for it was called “Raptistuta” and means a sea of mud! Mud is the worst enemy for movement (even hard snow can be managed) as it stalls movement to a very low speed. Monsoon would also mean rivers would be in spate so bridging & fording them would be eminently more challenging. August that year saw the worst tropical storm on record till date. It inundated whole parts of Bangladesh and killed half a million Bangladeshi’s.

•	The last was building up a strong and valid cassus belli (cause for war). If India was seen as the aggressor, sanctions would cripple an already crippled economy. It needed to make a case for itself. In the mean time it could use the Bangladeshi govt in exile (based in Calcutta) and the newly created Mutki Bahini to drum up support for itself.

Indira Gandhi agreed to his conditions and set about on a whirlwind tour of diplomacy. She went to Moscow, US, UK & France. She told the governments there that the situation was untenable, but Pakistan was a strong member of the SEATO and CENTO so the western democracies (in a blatant case of hypocrisy) stood by idly while a massive genocide was being perpetrated. Only the USSR recognized the problem, and shipped arms & ammunitions to India to build up her stockpile. India also signed a 20 year treaty of friendship and mutual assistance (this was to prevent any actions by the NATO / US / China)


Mankeshaw then went to work. He created a JIC (IB+RAW+Military intelligence) and a Joint Planning Command (India did not and still does not have a Combined Chief of Staffs like other nations do) to bring the civilians, army, navy and airforce together in the planning. Overall command was given to Lt Gen J.S.Arora who was CiC of the Eastern Command.


**Order Of Battle**


The OOB was as follows, Eastern Command > 3 Army Corps (2nd, 33rd and 4th) > 5 Infantry divisions + 2 Mountain that were on defensive mode. Attached to the infantry divs we had the equivalent of 1 armored division (broken up into regiments). 
Pakistan had roughly 3 Infantry divs and 2 divisions worth of paramilitary and a brigade of armour.


The odds were roughly 2:1 favouring India (conventionally 4:1 was recommended, 3:1 was the bare minimum). In the air India had total supremacy in the east(which was vital) and marginal superiority in the west.


The Mukti Bahini had roughly 60,000 numbers of irregulars. They played the exact same role the French partisans played in WW2 after Normandy. During the war, the Mukti Bahini contributed to the speed of advance of the Indians by providing ready labor and intelligence on the deployment of Pakistani forces. The MB sabotaged Pakistani lines of communication, they struck at weak points (in the rear) with brigade sized forces and caused the Pakistani defence to spread itself thin.


**The Indian Plan**

It was multi layered in it’s approach. Attack in depth to force the Pakistanis to thin themselves out, Cutoff river crossings (to prevent reinforcements and retreat from reaching the Pakistani troops) and finally capture the two key ports in Bangladesh. 

There was one major element of genius provided by J.S.Arora. He changed the Schwerpunkt from the logical south to the more difficult east. The South had it’s base in Bengal, had access to major railway lines and depots and Lt Gen Niazi (Pakistani commander) anticipated the main focus (Schwerpunkt) to be in this sector and aligned his defences accordingly. The East had everything going against it. The main base was inn Tripura, supply / logistics chains had immense difficulties but it was also the closest route to Dhaka. 

J.S Arora allocated the strongest force to the East and the weakest force to the South (the exact opposite of the Pakistani defensive alignment). This has it’s roots in classical warfare including WW2 and the battle of Cannae (which was positional warfare for it’s time). Operation Barbarossa focused it’s Schwerpunkt in the Centre and North while Stavka (Soviet high command aka Stalin) anticipated the key thrust in the South. The German approach to indirect warfare surprised the Russians and caused them a massive loss in men, space and equipment.


**The Pakistani Plan**

Counter offensive in the West and a tiered defense in the East using river lines and cities as strong points (very similar in concept to the Russian defense in WW2 – use river lines and force attritional warfare on the invader. Retreat to city holdfasts and engage troops in urban warfare. Hold out and delay the offensive till such time the UN forced a cease fire (like it had done in the Israeli wars). 

In Bangladesh, Niazi proposed retreating to just outside Dhaka and holding a region around Dhaka (using river lines and Dhaka as a central pivot). The Pakistani establishment rejected this. Once again we have parallels in World War 2. Poland had the option to withdraw it’s forces to the Vistula line, use Warsaw as a pivot and defend a limited area, both these sound ideas were rejected because…”Nationalism”! Not one inch of land would be surrendered etc etc. Niazi went for (as the Indian side had hoped) the WW2 Russian strategy of defending some fortified towns (or as Hitler called them – Festungs) and river lines (bridges). 

The idea was to cut down on the Indian freedom of movement by forcing them to engage in urban warfare. They did make a fatal flaw in their planning. They assumed that India would fight 10 different “Stalingrads”, and never reach Dhaka so they never allocated troops to defend Dhaka (the same mistake Hitler made in WW2 with respect to the defence of Berlin)


**The War**

•	3rd December, Operation Chingis goes in. Pakistan launches a preemptive strike on Indian airfields (in the West). The IAF fights a holding campaign before launching a massive bombardment operation the next morning. In the East, elements of 33 Corps go into action, their objective is to take a vital railway junction. Hilli however was one of the first echelons of Pakistan’s defenses and was very well prepared and supplied. The battle quickly became a battle of attritional warfare, however 340 Brigade spotted an opening in the flank and in a very German Blitzkrieg type of operation, formed combat groups (on the spot) of tanks and infantry and exploited the gap, and these combat groups raced to the river lines that Pakistan had intended to use as defensive strongpoints. Faced with Indians in the rear and forward of them, the resistance quickly collapsed.


•	In the South, using maneuver warfare (as against to positional warfare used by 33 Corp) 2 Corps makes rapid progress, 2 Corps launches a pincer attack using two infantry divisions to envelop Pakistani defences. They keep pushing on towards their target without giving the defenders time to rest and redraw their defensive lines. 2 Corps used the classic maneuver tactics used by Germany in WW2, Israel in the Sinai. They ignored strong points while rushing the rear of the enemy lines (the OMG of Russian doctrine came into play). The infantry pushed on into Pakistani frontline positions who attempted to withdraw to prepared lines only to find them occupied by Indian troops. Defense spectacularly collapsed in this sector. 

•	In the East, 4 Corps (the largest Indian grouping with 3 divisions) and a bold leader pretty much repeated what 2 Corps did. The CO (Lt Gen Sagat Singh) used the Russian concept of Maskirovka and set up a feint attack towards Chittagong, this drew Pakistani defenders (already facing 3:1 odds) to Chittagong weakening their centre. Here we come across a massive feat of arms – Airlifting of 2 entire combat equipped brigades. Rather than contest the Meghna river bridges, Singh sidestepped the exceedingly strong Pakistani defences by getting 2 brigades airlifted and dropped across the river (right into Pakistani lines). The eastern sector was decided as the Schwerpunkt (the focus point of the offensive) and it showed. The Indian troops rapidly outflanked prepared Pakistani positions, artillery was used to bombard these pockets into submission, the IAF flew CAS (Combat Air Support) / Interdiction missions all of which freed the infantry and armour to keep moving. This was classic Blitzkrieg minus only the Stuka sirens. 


The Pakistani forces were in headlong retreat towards Dhaka and this posed a big problem. If they gained the Dhaka region, they could organize a very stubborn defense which would cost 1000’s of Indian lives to capture. To prevent this, 2 Para was dropped BEHIND enemy lines into the region of Tangail. They were very less in number, and if the Pakistanis had grouped up and attempted to fight their way through, 4 Para could have been decimated, but thanks to the Indian Blitzkrieg tactic, the Pakistani C&C set up was decimated and they could not mount a cohesive response. After the drop, the demoralization (and destruction) of organized resistance was complete.


**Psycops**


The Pakistani resistance still numbered in the 1,00,000 and pockets could take a lot of Indian lives to break, so India went on a pysop campaign. Pakistani wirless networks were spammed with “surrender and live” messages (India had cracked the cipher used in East Pakistan before the war itself), Sam Bahadur himself went on air and told Pakistanis that if they surrendered they would be treated honourably, and this cracked any vestige of resistance. Pakistani soldiers began surrendering to the Indian army in droves. Niazi signed the instrument of surrender (a bitter man) on 16th December and went into captivity, along with him 91,000 Pakistani troops also went into captivity.

Reddiquette : On Israel,5,25ussa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25ussa/reddiquette_on_israel/,35,1400439278.0,"I made some obviously controversial statements that set many a knicker ablaze, didn't want to go about responding to each and every one of these individually, and also thought it would be good to have fresh thread talking from the non Israeli Pov.

Before I start - seriously, I now understand how it feels to be at the receiving end of my right wing brethren, I have been called an anti-Semite (how, questioning a country's policies and it's government makes me an anti anything is beyond me), weed smoking hippie, delusional Palestinian apologist amongst other stuff, my question to you folks who insist on needless ad-hominem is this, 

Can't one have a view which is contrarian to yours? Must everybody see the world only from your prism? Why needless ad-hominem? Everybody can indulge in it, but what would be the outcome? We would only be slinging insults at each other which mean nothing in real life and civil discourse is given the go by.

Once more onto the breech!!! but before I substantiate the claims I had made, some commonly repeated lines of reasoning need to be rebutted.

**Israel is surrounded by enemies & it's very survival is in question, so it has the right to do whatever it feels like doing**

* This was true in 47, this was true in 67 (which is where the seeds of the current conflicts were sown), but it is absolutely not true in 2014 (or not for the past 25-30 years at the least).

* It's major opposition has been completely neutralised - Egypt? It has a peace accord which both have respected, likewise Jordan, Iraq is out of the equation, Iran's nuclear plans have been neutralised and while on paper it remains a credible threat, the reality is that the whole world knows, if Iran even makes a hint of a hostile move in this region against any country, let alone Israel, it will feel the full impact of the US military (and maybe NATO as a whole)...so Iran is clearly not a threat. That leaves us states like Lebanon (which has it's own problems, largely caused by Israeli policies, and has shown that left to it's own tends to gravitate towards a fairly tolerant model).

* In terms of defence budgets, in terms of quality of manpower, training, equipment (all Uncle Sam's blessings mostly) the IDF is far and away miles ahead of it's closest competitors, so this whole ""Israel under siege"" nonsense needs to be put to rest.

**Israel is this utopia for Israeli Arabs**

* At the outset, one cannot but be blind to the fact that Israeli arabs have far more rights in Israel than in any other major Islamic country, only a fool will deny it, but it still has some serious questions raised on how Israeli arabs are treated as second class citizens with serious cries of even an almost apartheid like state in many areas and there are moves to constitutionalise this in the form of the [Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_proposal:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People), [some more on this](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/04/binyamin-netanyahu-israel-jewish-state).

Historically this goes against what it's founder David Ben Gurion wanted - he wanted (and had his way when the constitution of Israel was framed) Arabs to be treated equally, and no discrimination at all to be practiced. At the time Israel was formed, he went all out to assure Arabs that they will be treated well in Israel and requested Arab's to stay back in their villages and homes. Now in a classic case of fear mongering (similar to the one in India), Muslim leaders warned of a genocide of Arab's & Muslims and succeeded in winning over their people and thus began a massive exodus.

This hawkish stance of Israel in recent times is what I as an observer of that region deride - if when truly surrounded by enemies, Israel could afford to be magnanimous, what is the need now to disenfranchise Arabs? How different (in spirit if not in actual themes) is this different from the [Nuremberg laws?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws)

How can, *Arabs are second class citizens in Israel, but are better off than in other Arab countries ever be an excuse for this discrimination*? Is Tu quoque ever a solution? When a country like Israel with it's history of treating Muslims, Arabs well (Israeli) over time becomes exceedingly hawkish and discriminatory, does it not require wide condemnation? 


Now, to address the points I had made.

**Israel consistently violates agreement's it has signed or agreed to sign in negotiations with the PLO / Palestinian Arabs**

A couple of Wiki links on stuff like this alone will not suffice, they barely even scratch the surface of the reality that is Israel's duplicituous and perfidious stance when it comes to dealing with the Palestinians.

Let me as an example address Madrid. /u/pbdirigible says no agreement was signed in Madrid as that is what Wiki will tell you.

Reality went like this,

* As a precondition to Madrid, Israel wanted a UN resolution - resolution # 3379 struck off it's books (revoked), the US and the Arabs agreed to this and it was done.

* Yizhtak Shamir then wanted an unconditional loan guarantee of $ 10 billion from the US (which was later given without any fuss to the next Israeli regime to form the government), but the Bush proposal of wanting specific guarantees from Israel on troop reduction from the occupied territories was outright rejected. Bush stood firm on this, and Shamir had to back down.

* Then came the new effort at stalling the process - Shamir and Israel outright rejected PLO negotiators (though PLO was as per the previous resolution 3379 granted observer status and was the defacto political entity representing the Palestinians), he got his way.

* Then Israel played it's final trump card - Madrid won't see any Israeli negotiation, but it will broadly agree on the items to be negotiated (troop withdrawals, and Israeli withdrawal from the illegally occupied territories). These two items had been a condition of the ceasefire after the Yom Kippur war - [Resolution 242](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242) and [Resolution 338](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242), the Palestinians (secretly operating on behalf of the PLO) agreed. By this time Shamir had lost the elections (he was seen as too hawkish even by the Israeli's) and Rabin had come to power - he said **Israel WILL HONOUR it's commitments, and slowly start phased troop withdrawals and got the $ 10 BN loan**...and then promptly Israel went back on it's words. It did hold 5 other parleys, in which they stalled the entire process (Palestinian demands were simple, do what Israel has repeatedly promised to do) till it collapsed without anything emerging from it.

This level of duplicity was then seen in Oslo, to go into that at length would mean too much of a digression, but suffice to say that Israel played the same game of making promises (This time in an accord, so no disputing it) and then promptly going back on them. From the previous parleys and UN resolutions, Israel forced Arafat to something called three tier zones - in which Palestinian self governance was recognised ONLY in Zone A which was a very truncated area, this buried all Israeli promises, UN resolutions, Security council resolutions finally - of course, now, they are encroaching onto even zone A.

I will keep adding to this post as it is taking me time to draft these. I hope that my rabid right winger bretheren cool down on the ad-hominem, don't call me a pot smoking hippie who pulls stuff from his arse and respond with facts, figures and opinions formed out of those.

Interestingly enough, I was also a hard core Israel supporter till 5-6 years ago, when a lot of reading from the Palestinian perspective gave me a whole lot to think about.

Some must read to get a balanced perspective (if you are interested in a balanced perspective that is)

* [The Great War for Civilisation by Robert Fisk](http://www.amazon.in/The-Great-War-Civilisation-Conquest/dp/1400075173) - This is a MUST READ for anybody interested in understanding the politics in the Middle East

* [Lords of the Land](http://www.amazon.in/Lords-Land-Settlements-Occupied-Territories/dp/1568584148/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400410129&sr=1-1&keywords=Lords+of+the+Land%3A+The+War+Over+Israel%27s+Settlements+in+the+Occupied+..) - the paperback is atrociously expensive, but most uni libraries stock it, or the Kindle version is only Rs 500 or so.

* The Arab-Israeli Conflict: A History by Ian Bickerton - provides some solid insight into the roots of the conflict. I paired this with some fictional work by Leon Uris, gave me a good flavour for the period.

* Fictional works by Leon Uris (just for the flavour, he does some solid research)

* Israel the West Bank and International Law - The definitive work on the legal aspects (various UN resolutions, the whole legality of the Israeli occupation etc), a little dry, but interesting if you can break through the whole dry style.

Note - I have referenced Wiki as a starting point, but my main citations would be from the books I have referred, though please don't expect me to start quoting page numbers - I am not quoting directly from these (and other books I have not mentioned here), but my ideas and opinions were framed by these.

Lets talk about future, suppose a service like Netflix is started in India, which becomes so famous, that almost, 50-60% of population is on Netflix on sunday, using more than 50-60% of total bandwidth available with that technology, wouldn't it decrease the bandwidth of an emergency service, or Hospital, or research lab, or defense services.

Take the rise of Sonia, she quelled all dissent, ruthlessly shut down eminent people like Narashima Rao, chose to operate the PM via remote control, thereby denigrating the role of the PM as the head of state who constitutionally has only the President above him, has her ""eyes & ears"" in all aspects of governance, who has despite holding all the reins of power been a reculse and has given maybe 2,3 interviews at best in 10 years.

We need not even go down to the regional parties where people like Mulayam, Maya or Jaya lord it up like kings & queens.

Modi on the other hand, has had to fight his claim to be CM of Guj, has had to fight his way to be the face of the BJP, he still has his powerful detractors within the BJP.

Reading Group #2: 'Qazzaqi' by Munshi Premchand (English translation),29,bvggge,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bvggge/reading_group_2_qazzaqi_by_munshi_premchand/,11,1559387757.0,"Sometime back /u/doc_two_thirty and I had [floated the idea of having a reading group](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpaan5/are_you_interested_in_being_part_of_a_reading/) for Indian literature, and since there was some interest, we decided to share a story every two weeks for the group to read. We are limiting ourselves to publicly available short stories by Indian authors. Our first story was '[Delhi' by Vandana Singh](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpnh70/reading_group_1_delhi_by_vandana_singh_sff/). This week, the story is: 
> 
> #['Qazzaqi' by Munshi Premchand](http://outofprintmagazine.co.in/archive/sept_2017_issue/munshi-premchand_qazzaqi.html) 
> This story was first published in 1926 in a Hindi magazine called Madhuri, and if you have Premchand's Collected Works in Hindi, you will find this story in vol 5 of 
> Mansarovar. This English translation is by Fatima Rizvi, and was published in Out of Print Magazine, and was a runner up for the Jawed Memorial translation prize.
> A Hindi audio narration by Jameel Gulrayys is available on Youtube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=902y-a1VIZg).

For those who aren't familiar, Dhanpat Rai Shrivastava, who wrote under the pen-name of [Munshi Premchand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premchand), was a prolific - and popular - writer of short stories in Hindi, in the early 1900s. 

This story is interesting for many reasons - 'Qazzaqi' means outlaw, although in the story, the qazzaqi in question is a mail-carrier. Premchand's acute understanding of poverty and class is very apparent from this story of the friendship between a the qazzaqi and a young child. 

The rules are simple - read the story and tell us what you thought about it in the comments. If you haven't read the story yet, I'd suggest you stay away from the comments as people's comments may contain spoilers! Please observe reddiquette - be polite and respectful.

Since we got a good response, our first reading group story is: 
> 
> #'**Delhi' by Vandana Singh** 
(Lightspeed Magazine, 2016) [approx 7000 words] 

> Read the story here: http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/delhi/

This story, written in English, is about a man who can drift in and out of different periods of time. This temporal (i.e. time-related) travelling takes him through different historical periods of the city of Delhi, as it was under different emperors and rulers. 

For our first time with this reading group, I wanted to pick a story by one of my favourite speculative fiction authors from India - Vandana Singh. She was born and brought up in India, and she now teaches physics at an American university- though her stories, written in English and Hindi, are mostly science fiction and fantasy drawing from life in India. You can read more about her at her [website](http://vandana-writes.com/about-vandana/) or on Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandana_Singh). She recently published a short story collection called [Ambiguity Machines and Other Stories](https://zubaanbooks.com/shop/ambiguity-machines/) (Zubaan Books), but this story is from an earlier anthology of science fiction called '[So Long Been Dreaming](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/847409.So_Long_Been_Dreaming)'.

The rules are simple - read the story and tell us what you thought about it in the comments.

"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",23,ai7392,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/,17,1548078786.0,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",2

We really need to talk about Flairs.,104,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,1494883276.0,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",2

[MOD POST] /r/india needs your help to maintain civility and a balanced discourse. Please spare a few minutes to give this a read. 2 new flairs introduced.,231,2cnzjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2cnzjy/mod_post_rindia_needs_your_help_to_maintain/,420,1407248975.0,"Hi /r/India,  
Standing close to the 26,000 subscriber mark, today we kind of have a bitter-sweet moment here on /r/India. Most of you must be aware of the blatant hate-mongering, religious intolerance and rumors being spread on our subreddit, riding safely under the pretext: Freedom of Speech. Any action taken by us to regulate this, is met with an army of hateful comments, downvotes and outcries of censorship. 

This propaganda is in no way the combined sentiment of /r/india and is basically the work of a few dedicated individuals using this subreddit as their personal weapon. With their strong language, and hateful comments, these radicals have kind of succeeded in discouraging people with opposing views to even bother participating and questioning their false, bigoted propaganda. 

We let this go on for quite a while now, hoping the community will self-moderate and drown these seemingly hate-filled radicals with their voice and votes, but after seeing comments openly asking for genocide of certain religious sects (you know which) getting upvoted to the top, we have decided to put an end to this ourselves.

Following are a couple of new rules and re-iterations on existing ones:

1. **Unverified Flair**: Posts making claims without any credible source are liable to get flaired as Unverified by the mods. This flair will be removed swiftly if OP or any other user provides substantial proof  for their claims. NOTE: Facebook updates and/or tweets by unverified parties do not count as *credible source*.

2. **Moderated Flair**: Starting today, *all religious posts* are *liable* to be marked as **Moderated** by the mods. Off late, we have seen discussions going from *Manusmriti to cow-urine, riots to burning people alive.* Moderated posts will be actively monitored for hate speech and off-topic comments inciting hatred and bigotry. This flair can *also* be applied to non-religious post which are controversial by their nature, based on our discretion, to keep the discussion civil and on-topic. Moderated is similar to the [\[R\]eddiquette flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/reddiquette) and all the rules that come with it.  As a suggestion, please remember, /r/india is a subreddit about India, Indians and matters that directly related to India. Please use theology subreddits for generic discussions on religions.

 Before the questions about censorship come up, let us clear things up (to the best of our abilities) as to what the Moderated flair will ensure (just one from million examples):  
 * We will NOT remove your opinions on how Kejriwal is a drama queen, playing appeasement politics, or why Modi doesn’t care about Muslims (provided it is relevant to discussion at hand)
 * But if your opinion is how all muslims need to be deported to Pakistan and Hindus need to drown in cow piss, I’m sorry we really don’t need your brilliant opinion in moderated threads.  
 * *+1 to OP*: No thanks, we have votes for this. Take your love for OP to PMs  
 * *OP is just wearing saffron glasses / OP is secular*: Stop! we are better off without your insight. 

 There are infinite such examples which cannot possibly be covered, but this should give you a basic idea.

3. **Self Posts:** /r/india is a social media platform to share links, and for thoughtful discussion. This is not twitter or facebook to share biased and unsubstantiated opinions. This is not your soapbox to vent in the title and leave an empty post behind for people to squabble about. All self posts that have no OC in the body will be removed. Context is important. Self posts with incendiary titles will be removed.

4. **Banning of users:** We issue warnings to users as a courtesy, and to give them a chance to realign with the rules on /r/india. As such, banning people is solely a moderator’s discretion. The nature of the ban (temp ban or otherwise, number of warnings) depends on the user’s history and the kind of comment(s) in question. Hate speech, users with singular agenda will be banned instantly with no warnings.

5. **Use Reddiquette Flair:**  If you’re looking to have a serious discussion on a topic, if you're sick ad tired of the same bunch of users turning every topic into a religious/political shitfest, please use the [\[R\]eddiquette flair.](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/reddiquette) We’ll make sure the trolls and hate-mongers stay away, 

**Lastly, Please Participate More:** Your votes make a difference. 

We really want to request each and every one of you to help us in keeping this subreddit a clean and civil forum for discussion. At the end of the day, /r/india is as good as the vocal participants. If you want to see a thoughtful community that is able to discuss important issues without petty squabbles, **go and Vote! Speak up** and be part of the voice. Upvote all the relevant and quality comments. Downvote irrelevant comments/posts, bigotry, name-calling and hatred filled comments.  
You don't have to limit yourselves to Random Daily Discussion or a few fun threads, just because some devious users can't make a coherent sentence without calling you names. Systematic harassment and bullying will not be tolerated on /r/India, and if you're on the receiving end of this behavior, feel free to drop us a message anytime.

We are just 10 mods spread across different timezones, and it’s very difficult to do his without community’s support. Thanks for reading and hope to see a better /r/India tomorrow!

---

**TL;DR**:  

1. Unverified Flair for posts without credible source
2. All religious posts might be flaired as *Moderated*: which is essentially R enforced.
3. Please participate more: Vote, and make your voice heard. Question bigotry and don't be intimidated by a few hatefilled users

Few observations about this sub.,84,3my4q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3my4q2/few_observations_about_this_sub/,71,1443635836.0,"I have experienced the power of hiveminds many times on reddit, the most recent one being in this thread:

https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3mx2b5/next_door_to_delhi_mob_kills_50yearold_injures/

Not ranting specifically about the downvotes here, but it would be nice if people understood that following Reddiquette is essential to maintain the standards of discussions on reddit. Reproducing a part of Reddiquette here specific to voting:

>Vote. If you think **something contributes to conversation**, upvote it. If you think it **does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted** in or is **off-topic** in a particular community, downvote it.

>Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and **examine your reasons for downvoting**, rather than doing so **out of an emotional reaction**, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

Few observations that I want to highlight:

1) People are always going to have a different opinion from that of yours. And this forum should be used to understand that differing opinion and the thought-process behind it. After all, we are trying to learn from each other here. If you still don't agree with that opinion just move on. No one is on a mission here to brainwash people into agreeing to something over here.

2) We are all educated folks here. We know that every human being is complicated and he cannot be labelled and put into neat square boxes. Still,we always want it to be either 'this' or 'that'? If someone is opposing BJP, it makes him a AAP loyalist. If someone is criticising the government it makes him an anti-nationalist. If someone is finding fault with a road project through Western Ghats, it makes him a Maoist.

3) If you don't understand something, ask for more explanation. Don't assume things, vote and then carry that incomplete knowledge elsewhere. Ignorance spreads like wild fire and what you mention here might actually end up in someone's serious coffee-table discussions. Always, support your comments with sources when possible. Also, keep in mind just because a comment has lots of sources, doesn't necessarily mean that opinion is unbiased.

4) Jokes and funny comments - Make them all you want and share the lulz but don't use them to attack someone because his opinion is different from that of the crowd. Doesn't really serve the purpose. You wouldn't do that if you are having a serious discussion with your friends, would you?

5) Generalising and stereotyping - Makes your argument weak if you indulge generalizations and stereotyping (Hindus are blah blah, Modi always does blah blah). We have an issue with /r/worldnews having bad stereotypes about us. Have we checked our own sub before pointing fingers at others?

6) Put yourself in the other guy's shoes - I see a lot of comments criticising people without actually trying to understand their PoV. Why they do/say whatever they did/said? What were the circumstances? Would you have reacted differently if you had been in their place?

There are users, I know of, on this sub who gets downvoted on almost every thread because they generally make unpopular comments which differ from the common opinion (not troll comments, genuinely good sensible comments). The same users get upvoted like crazy if they make a lulzworthy comment. Kind of shows you that there is something seriously broken with how this sub functions sometimes. 

I know this post would probably be downvoted but I wanted to post it nonetheless. I learn a lot from this site and it is still one of the best sources of lulz and learning for me on the internet. I don't want to go hunting for other better sites at least for few more years.",2
PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,44,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,1461362094.0,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc. 




TLDR: Nope! Read it.",2
Do your bit to make /r/india a friendlier place! (Please upvote for visibility),215,18mkwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/18mkwq/do_your_bit_to_make_rindia_a_friendlier_place/,157,1361024865.0,"Hi /r/india! 

The most common complaints about /r/india arise because of it's culture. Downvoting, abuses and hostility towards differing opinions are very common. We've all had our days when we recoil, aghast, from the cesspool of comments on a particular thread.

Nevertheless, the cloud has a silver lining. Older users will agree that things have improved significantly since the days of the multiple -ki-baap, -ki-maa, and _spokesperson accounts. How can we nurture and sustain this delicate green shoot of civil discussion? Here are some guidelines, adapted from [reddit's ettiquette guide.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

###1. The downvote is not a ""dislike"" button
Please do not downvote a post or a comment only because you think it's wrong, or you're not interested in it. 

Downvote **posts** if you think these kinds of posts do not belong on /r/india, or if you've seen the same content being posted multiple times before. Multiple posts of a single breaking news events, million photographs of ""farmers"", and links to FB flamewars are good examples of posts which I would downvote. 

Downvote **comments** if you think it is harmful to the discussion. Rude attacks on other users, paranoid conspiracy theories, and _some_ trolls are examples of comments I would downvote. I don't like Modi, but many times I have upvoted comments which support him because many people have different opinions, and I respect that. 

###2. Redditors are real people too!
This is an anonymous internet forum, and it's easy to temporarily forget that the user you're speaking to is a real person, with family and a life and her own problems, likes and dislikes. So before you call someone an idiot, retard, chaddi, Congie, etc., please think: would you do this to a real person in your life? What makes you think it's okay to do that to people on reddit? 

###3. /r/india is mainly what users make it
A subreddit is mainly determined by what its users do. If you want more self posts, submit more, and upvote them when you see them. If you want less politics, ~~downvote~~ IGNORE politics posts, and submit and upvote more non-political content.     
If you are not okay with insults and rudeness, then leave a _polite_ reminder asking people to be more civil. Downvote only the worst comments.

----

tl;dr: The next time you feel an urge to downvote someone politely saying something about Modi, Sachin, rape, SRK, or how your hometown sucks, please DON'T. Even worse, don't insult them for their opinion. _Explain_ why you disagree, instead.  
Don't _only_ complain about content, please contribute content you would like to see. ",2

[R]Political Threads - A new way forward,0,2rv4tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2rv4tw/rpolitical_threads_a_new_way_forward/,462,1420846854.0,"Greetings /r/india
 
Over the last few years we have seen a steady growth of subscribers. This has brought in great participation and some unpleasant behavior. To combat the latter, we have implemented a detailed set of rules and added members to our team to help enforce them. This has resulted in a much better place to discuss ideas without being threatened physical harm.
 
However, this still gives a few people room to circumvent rules and indulge in low-effort comments that meant purely to rile other users or to insult people of a certain religion or political belief. So going forward, we'd like to elevate the state of discussions on this sub.
 
For the next 3 weeks, as an experiment, **all** political and Religious threads will be [Rediquette enforced](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/reddiquette) by default. We Indians love to talk about politics and no one can take that away from us. What we do ask is that people put a little more thought into what they say, so that /r/india is a little better place to talk than the rabid comments section of the Times Of India. Incidentally, this was one of the changes requested in the feedback thread by a few people.
 
What will be blocked in the comments
 
* Slurs
 
* Invectives such as ""seculars/sanghis/bhakts/*tards/communal"" - this list is not complete, but serves as an example. Armchair lawyers trying to circumvent this, please don't take this as a challenge but understand where we come from and cooperate.
 
* Low-effort comments such as ""Lol what can you expect from these fascists/rightwingers/leftists"". Make a point, but put some thought into it.
 
 
What will still be allowed in the comments (as long as they don't belong to the categories above)
 
* Sarcasm, jokes and humor - make jokes about apparel all you want, just put some effort into it
 
* Memes
 
 
Quite simply put, we're trying to enforce the [No Asshole rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_No_Asshole_Rule). If this trial period succeeds, we will make the changes permanent.

You can help us out by reporting comments that do not belong to political threads.
 
Thank you for your participation and we look forward to building a better community and dream of a 24 hour period where we won't be asked to fornicate ourselves.",2

Greetings /r/Indians Old and New: A word about comment score hiding feature,36,1jq5iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1jq5iv/greetings_rindians_old_and_new_a_word_about/,184,1375712879.0,"Hello /r/india,

I feel we got off on the wrong foot here. I can narrate the series of events which led to this miscommunication but it’ll be in vain. Over the past week we realized that there is a major communication gap between the users and certain moderation initiatives we have under taken. To be precise I am talking about the ‘comment score hiding’ feature test initiated by mod /u/rahulthewall 2 days ago. The feature was introduced to the mods by reddit admins a couple of months ago and since then a lot of communities have tested and implemented it successfully. We realize that there are a number of new users in /r/india and reddit in general who do not understand what this feature means or what it is supposed to achieve. In fact a lot of old users also seem to be either confused about its utility or are against it for their own valid reasons.

I would recommend that the community read the following links to know more about this feature and then discuss its relevance in /r/india in the comments of this thread.

• **[Voting on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting)** 


• **What is comment score hiding?** : Minutes to hide comment scores is a subreddit setting accessible to moderators of a subreddit. If set, comments in the subreddit will have their score hidden for the specified number of minutes, after which the score will appear as normal. For example, if set to ""60"", any comments less than an hour old will not show their score. Voting still behaves normally, and behavior of the page will not otherwise be affected (best/top sorting will still use the scores, comments with score less than the user's threshold will be collapsed, etc.), but the comment's actual score will not be visible until it is at least that many minutes old. [Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/)

• **Goal**: The goal of this feature is to try to reduce the initial bandwagon/snowball voting, where if a comment gets a few initial downvotes it often continues going negative, or vice versa. By hiding the score for a while after posting, the bias of seeing how other people voted on the comment should be greatly reduced.

Some other notes about how this feature works:
 - The maximum for the setting is 1440 minutes (24 hours). 
- Scores will remain visible to moderators (and admins). 
- Scores will also be hidden for RES users, mobile users, etc. (will display as the comment having the default 1 point in mobile clients)

* /r/india on Comment score hiding: [2 DAY OLD POST](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1jjx0b/to_the_mods_of_rindia_about_hidden_scores/) | [3 MONTH OLD POST](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1dew7v/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/)

• **General Reddit Feedback**: The community opinion is largely divided about this feature, but many subs have found it extremely useful. [Further Reading](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1e0dyz/moderators_general_feedbackfollowup_for_the_new/) 

Some users have reacted more negatively than others and accused the moderators of being on some sort of a power trip. Please be assured that every action we take here is to make the community better. We spend all day keeping your subreddit free of a variety of innovative spam, shameless self promotion, page-view mongers, porn among others things. We make sure that your real identities are secure and that no one incites a witch hunt against another user and that things never escalate to a level where the subreddit gets banned or hot listed. If you ever have any questions or need clarifications (heck we’ve even answered questions about comment formatting) about any aspect of /r/india then please feel free to write to us on [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia). Our response time is pretty quick usually; those of you who have written to us or who write to us regularly can vouch for it.

**Next step**:

• It is our suggestion that the feature be kept active for another 5 days to complete at least a week of testing. (The ideal testing time is usually 2 weeks)

• The poll will be active for the entire duration of the test and we will announce results at the end of the week.

• This is the Official Community discussion thread on the ‘comment score hiding feature’. Please put your point across in a civil manner, use your vote wisely and don’t downvote just because you disagree.

• **[Take the doodle poll](http://doodle.com/yzqqd5fyh87kktpn), and register your official vote.**

It is my suggestion to the moderation team to keep their interaction on this thread to a minimal [except answering questions directed at us]. The community has heard from us; let’s hear what the readers have to say. I encourage /r/Indians to upvote this thread for maximum visibility and use their votes and comments in a civil manner without getting into rage fights with other users.

"Hey r/india, I'm planning on making a sub purely meant for se[r]ious debate and discussion.. Interested?",9,5lmmmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5lmmmj/hey_rindia_im_planning_on_making_a_sub_purely/,6,1483409643.0,"/r/debateindia 

Had started this sub a while back and even posted about it here. Unfortunately I couldn't get much traction and only a few people ended up joining, so I stopped working on it.

While /r/india is a decent place for most things, it's impossible nowadays to have any form of discussion here without having to wade through unfunny jokes, troll accounts, mass downvoting and all (no offense meant to anyone, including the mods). 

There's no real platform for good, India-centric, discussion. Facebook is... well, you know. Quora is an IIT/IIM circlejerk. Reddit can truly be an amazing place to have amazing conversations. Especially if proper reddiquette is followed (and maybe enforced?).

This is why I'm considering maybe putting up more effort and maybe resuming /r/debateindia. I'll need your help to get more mods, set the rules, and start it up.

What do you guys think? :) Any interest?",2

"A small appeal, r/India",61,qk432,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/qk432/a_small_appeal_rindia/,114,1331069367.0,"*This is regarding the act of up-voting and down-voting on this subreddit.* 

Before I start, here's a link to [Rediquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). I sincerely hope all of you, at some point, have gone through it. 

Now I understand how making a post regarding the voting could seem against one of the tenets of Rediquette, but I must, at this point, emphasize that I'm saying this with concern that a community, I feel attached to, is/could be discouraging other users, existing or prospective.

Now, it is a simple observation and I'm sure most of you would agree with me when I say, for reasons unbeknownst, most comments and posts here attract lots of downvotes. With due regard to the vote-fuzzing explained by the admins, in comparison to other subreddits, I can only observe there is heavier downvoting here. At this point, if the mods or users have an alternative plausible explanation to the phenomenon, the rest of the post could be deemed pointless. 

By rediquette, which I hope is something we agree upon, the only reasons why anyone should downvote is if you find that the content to be irrelevant to the topic or against community guidelines such as posting personal information, abusive content etc. It is suggested against downvoting someone just because you disagree with them or if they are critical of your views. It's also an encouraged practice to state why you downvote someone so it acts as constructive criticism. 

Coming to the noticeable practices in r/India, 

* users attract downvotes because they present alternative views in thread which are predominantly about one topic and not inviting discourse or diatribe.
* some users attract downvotes because they have at some point, divulged their personal information like religious beliefs, regions etc and they choose to comment with a counter-view. This info. is pointed out relentlessly under the said comment and turned into an ad-hominem attack. 
* some users attract downvotes because of their handles although it might have nothing to do with the content in their comments.  
* some users have repeatedly been mass-downvoted because they are considered trolls by a lot of other users. At this point, I'd just like to point out that viewing a comment unto itself is understandably better than holding a cumulative of their opinions every time you vote. If a said 'religious troll' is making a comment about auto-rickshaws in a city, he/she is still heavily downvoted.
* grammar, quality of comment etc also attract downvotes. Please bear in mind that not all users may be very comfortable with English. 

Karma means nothing and its hardly indicative of users' seriousness here. However, while downvotes needn't be paid any heed, they can discourage serious users who don't quite mind contributing to the discussions here. As someone who has been a regular here for over two years, it's disheartening to see so many well-meaning members leave and/or repeatedly feel discouraged. 

It's only a sincere request to the various members and trolls here to give others a chance, be open to ideas and more importantly, stop discouraging other users through blatant and oftentimes abusive criticism or the quintessential downvote. 

This isn't and needn't be a serious concern to me or most people here but it's a practice that doesn't take much to follow and could only be viewed, imho, as a constructive step.

P.S. [Obligatory Indian cat picture](http://i.imgur.com/INzoO.jpg)

**EDIT:** Far from surprise, this post also has started receiving its share of downvotes. 

But more importantly, I'd like to add a point on trolling. There are some obvious troll accounts who comment on most threads. The whole exercise of trolling is to be seek negative attention. Kindly refrain from downvoting Or upvoting the said troll accounts. You're only fueling the act and that's not desirable. Please ignore and carry on.  ",2

I found that threads like Fibonnaci number (TIL sub), India dropping it's claim off the coast of Bangladesh (World News) more informative in the global subs while in our dear /r/India I found the usual name calling and the eternal kulcha vs non kulcha debate.

As a suggestion could we all (again, cutting across party lines) post stuff on topic, pertinent and eschew from the pointless personal attacks? When the community gets going we generate some awesome discussions even on topics such as [AAP](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2chvdi/serious_question_to_aap_supporters_reddiquette/) or [Colonial era India] (http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2chllt/you_should_know_the_arthashastra_is_not_just_a/) (usually very polarising subjects)

A Humble Request,59,k27id,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k27id/a_humble_request/,57,1314974115.0,"This is a humble plea to all my fellow redditors in r/india and to whoever is trolling us in the name of maula and his sock-puppets.

The forum has gone through so many changes in the last year. We have grown from a small community of 3000 subs to close to 6000 subs within 8 months. 

Reddit as a community has contributed to many positive changes in the US. Look at what kleinbl00 did for youngluck, or look at communities like r/favors, r/assistance, r/randomactsofpizza and their likes. 

I'm not asking or even suggesting that r/india to do something on that level. All I'm asking for is civility in discussions and to users to stop abusing each other. 

From a community that was robust in its discussions, we have devolved into a community of name calling, hatred, trolling and religious hatred. Debates are healthy and enrich the knowledge of everyone involved if done in the right manner. But here the only response seems to insulting each other and their family members

The experiment of banning users was something that I myself was not convinced on. But I didn't have the foresight to see the limitations of it and couldn't find an another acceptable way of maintaining civility in the forum. After discussing with the new mods, we decided to implement it as they were in agreement. 

What followed was something everyone knows. I will honestly accept my mistake of banning sniperinthebushes and apologise for it. My fellow mods ensured that it was reversed and I immediately realized what I had done and unbanned him. It was purely an emotional moment when I was called names and I acted on that. I have learnt much from that episode personally and have ensured that internet abuse does not affect me anymore.

I believe that r/india as a community will not stop growing and if this uncivil behaviour continues, we may end up attracting the wrong attention towards us and the community may suffer for it. 

Now that dirtyd0ggy has gone, can we, as a community, move on to making r/india a positive forum for discussion? 

I humbly request each and every one of you and the troll brigade to please, stop the religion bashing and hatred and abuse [also the ascii goatses] and the incessant downvoting. 

Let us make r/india as an example of what goodness we are capable of from our country.

[Rediquette] Want to get a healthy discussion going rearding the interpretation of The Puranas on the topic of Age of Universe.,5,300jvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/300jvs/rediquette_want_to_get_a_healthy_discussion_going/,17,1427150216.0,"Serious Discussion. Please avoid pointless downvoting if you don't like this post and let some people, who dont have views that are same as yours or modern science, have  peaceful discussion in the name of tolerance.  
  
So, i have seen confusions around this topic, so i will divide it into two parts. First will be the part that has no confusions.  
And in the second, i will try to answer confusions with my own interpretations and understandings which come from 7+ years of studying the puranas and 'living' the life of meditation (some questions are welcome):  
  
Non-Confusion Knowledge:  
--------------------------------------------  
  
1) The Lord Brahma comes into being at the start, lives for 100 of his years, each has 360 days, each daytime = kalpa and has 1000 chaturyugas, followed by an equal length of the night.  
  
2) Pretty much soon after coming into existence, The Lord of Creation starts to create the universe. So the lifetime of his is the same as age of universe 'till it will end'.  
So to calculate the complete age and not age as of today, we have:  
100 x 360 x 1000 x 2 kalpas. The two at the end corresponds to nighttime.  
The length of a kalpa I will cover in my interpretation.  
  
3) We are midway somewhere. To be exact:  
51st year of brahma  
Xth day of brahma (my interpretation later)  
7th manvantara  
28th chaturyuga  
Exact current yuga detail in my interpretation below.  
  
Confusion Part (and my interpretations):  
-----------------------------------------------------------------  
  
**1) Length of a chaturyuga in human years.**  
This I have inferred to be 24000 human years. The interpretation of some was 24000 celestial years which would mean 24,000 x 360=8,640,000 years. But this has recently been pointed out to be a wrong interpretation attributed to the effect of kaliyuga on the mind.  
Thus going by this, the final age of universe would be about 100 x 360 x 1000 x 2 x 24000 = 1,728,000,000,000 years or 1 trillion and 728 billion years. Of course, it is reasonable to agree that The Lord Brahma would have taken the equivalent of some human years before he actually began with his retinue and will end it not at the 12th hour.  
  
**2) Exact day of the 51st year of the Lord Brahma.**  
This I have interpreted to be 54th day.  
  
**3) Exact time in the current chaturyuga.**  
Again, as has been recently pointed, we are in the ascending dwapara of the 28th chaturyuga. And the Kaliyuga ended in the year 1699.  
These can be googled.  
  
Thus going by these, my personal interpretation of the 'current' age of the Universe is:  
a) For 50 years:  
50×360×1,000×2×24,000 = 864,000,000,000 years.  
  
b) For 53 past days:
53 x 2  x 1000 x 24000 =  2,544,000,000 years
  
c) For the current day:  
We are in the 7th manvantara (each has 71 chaturyugas + .5 in between manvantaras) and 28th of its chaturyuga, so  
6 x 71 + 3 + 27 = 456 chaturyugas gone, so:  
456 x 24000 =10,944,000 years
  
d) For the current chaturyuga:  
Since last kaliyuga ended in 1699, so since then we have had 2014 - 1699 = 315 years. Adding 12000 years for the descent, we have,  
12000 + 315 = 12315 till 31st december 2014.  
  
So, the final tally for the current age of the universe would be (adding the above a, b, c d calculations):  
 864,000,000,000 + 2,544,000,000 + 10,944,000 + 12315 = 866,554,956,315 years.  
  
**That is, the Current Age of the Universe is 866 billion, 554 million, 956 thousand and 315 years as of 31st december 2014.**
  
For the Final Age of the Universe we have:  
100 × 360 × 1000 × 2 × 24000 = 1,728,000,000,000 years.  
This is how long the material universe tends to last.  
  
Now, you are welcome to share your interpretations.   
  
Ok, I will add this reddit thing :  
**TLDR : My interpretation of the Current Age of the Universe is 866 billion, 554 million, 956 thousand and 315 years as of 31st december 2014**  
  
And this Hindu thing:  
**By the grace of the Lords and the blessings of Mothers, I release this knowledge to the world.**  
  
Edit : This blind downvoting is the sign of intolerance. Those who think they have understood too much of science, I would like to point it to them that the civilization of the west is a civilization of light. Go spread some light if you identify so much with it. Why do you get so insecure when other viewpoints are put up? Even interpretations? If you want to have your own space, dont call it india.

Yesterday, I was downvoted to oblivion for pointing out that beef is costlier than chicken in TN and Kerala. Apparently some motherfuckers who've never touched raw meat in their whole lives know better than this motherfucker who buys beef, chicken or pork, week in and week out. And it didn't stop even after I posted links proving my point. Obviously, you dimwits just prefer to ignore facts that go against your narrative.

If you assume that I'm crying about karma, you cunts are mistaken. I hate it when facts are buried in favour of continuing the circlejerk. It simply is detrimental to the health of the sub.

Announcement: New mod and change in submission rules,14,k54bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k54bk/announcement_new_mod_and_change_in_submission/,54,1315234726.0,"Please welcome rahulthewall as our new moderator. He has been an r/india regular for ages now and has contributed immensely to the positive development of our community. With the new mod team in place, r/india should be able to continue its growth in the right direction. 

With this announcement, I would also like to bring to your notice on few changes in the submission rules. 

The direct linking to blog rule is removed. You can do direct blog submissions from now on. But strictly no self promotion. Self promotion is defined in the reddiquette. 

Submitting articles from one blog and not submitting any other links and not participating in discussions are defined as self-promotion. Submitting blog links are fine once in a while [definition of this period is flexible]. But if you are spamming us, you will be banned.

I would like to explain the history beyond the old rule and why we removed it now. Between 2008 - 2009, r/india was spammed with direct submissions from blogs incessantly. This led to a rule of banning submissions from all blogs [blogspot, wordpress, tumblr, etc] 

From the end of 2010, we have seen this trend drop. So we relaxed this rule and allowed linking to blogs in a self-submission. Now this self-promotion has dropped completely. 

**Also, strictly no porn links.**

Most of us browse r/india in our workplaces and we would love to keep the access.

If you have any issues with the change in the blog submission rule, please let us know.",2

"Are no ""personal attacks"" allowed on /r/India? Is it a rule now?",0,205rfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/205rfs/are_no_personal_attacks_allowed_on_rindia_is_it_a/,46,1394592626.0,"I just noticed an /r/India mod threaten another commenter for using a personal expletive in one of the threads. The mod's threat was worded as follows:

> Can you stop with personal attacks??

> Please consider this as your first warning.

**It was not a Reddiquette enforced thread.** So, is it a general rule now that no ""personal attacks"" are allowed on /r/India on any thread? I checked the ""Rules"" in the side-bar, and there was nothing there about ""personal attacks"". There is something under the ""Requests"" which is worded thusly:

> Do read the Reddiquette and refrain from personal/vindictive attacks while commenting.

Several questions:

1. What is the difference between ""Rules"" and ""Requests""? I thought Requests are nice-to-have requests which can be ignored.

2. What constitutes a ""personal/vindictive attack""? Specifically, are the use of expletives now considered as considered as ""attacks""? What about calling someone a moron, an idiot, stupid, etc.? Where does the ""vindictive"" part figure in this?

3. Are ""personal attacks"" not allowed anywhere? Not even on non-Reddiquette enforced threads? So, no use of expletives?

4. Is ""no personal attacks"" an enforced rule or a suggested request? If it is the latter, please move it to the rules section. If it is the latter, please don't threaten people for ignoring a request.

5. Also, the request I quoted above suggests that we ""read the Reddiquette"", but nothing about following Reddiquette. Is that the intention?

I am being told that I am a Hindu. I am also told that my parents, relatives and the caste in which we were born and brought up are Hindu. This totally baffles me.  I, indeed not only I, but all of us, the dalitbahujans of India have never heard the word - not as a word, nor as a name of a culture nor as a name of a religion - in our childhood days. We heard about Turukoolli (Muslims), we heard about Kiristianiapoollut (Christians), we heard about Bapanoolu (Brahmins) and Konaioolli (Baniyas) spoken of as people who were different from us. Among these four categories, the most different were the Bapanoollu and the Komatoollu. There are at least some aspects of life common to us and the Turukoollu and the Kiristianapoollu. We all eat meat. We all touch each other... The only people with who we had no relations whatsoever were the Bapanoollu and the Komatoollu.

Now, I think this is a horrible and hollow idea. Political posturing at it's worst. What is the logic behind pouring such a large sum of money into a project like this when there are millions of people who are actually alive that the money would serve better? 

A large portion of the population goes hungry and cold every night. Why spend such a vast sum 'honoring' a dead man who probably wouldn't approve of this himself if he were alive to see it? Wouldn't empowering the poor and the destitute of our country be a better use for the money? 

I do not want this harebrained idea to see the light of day and I doubt that I am alone in this. What can we do to make our voices heard? What can we do to ensure that reason prevails in this matter? 

I understand that it will help tourism, but is that really worth the cost of letting the poorest among us go hungry? 

I speak as a layman who is quite out of the loop as far as politics is concerned so if there is an aspect of this that I am not considering, please, let me know.

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",13,bdfid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,27,1555360902.0,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.",3

The information there is quite old (I traced it back to at least 1878) and I find it a little dubious. Is - or was - there a group so named?

Recommendations for books on Indian history written by Indians?,17,avt1qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/avt1qx/recommendations_for_books_on_indian_history/,9,1551400322.0,"Hello r/India.

I'm British and would like to learn more about Indian history, but most of the most prominent scholarship on the subject in the UK has come from non-Indian Brits, and often comes with particular biases (particularly regarding British colonialism). I'd therefore appreciate it if anyone can point me towards good written histories of the country by Indian scholars.

For the history of British colonialism in India I've started with Shashi Tharoor's *Inglorious Empire*, but of course there's a lot more to India's genesis than British imperialism.

Cheers.

[Also, hope this isn't the wrong place to ask this, but r/askIndia seems a bit dead and the other thread I found about this topic seemed more focused on South India.]

"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",21,ai7392,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/,17,1548078786.0,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",3
Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,53,bemcxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,24,1555627392.0,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends.",3

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

Thank you very much for reading and commenting. ",3

AAP is out of the question as Kejriwal has demonstrated his greed and hunger for power again and again. He keeps allying himself with all the wrong parties in order to protest against whichever the incumbent is.

I will never vote for INC until they change their top leadership and overhaul the party structure as a pro-development secular party with centrist policies.

Who do I vote for?

BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them. 

Are there any good candidate/parties that are not affiliated to the Sangh Parivar/RSS/VHP?

If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state.

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here: 

https://www.amazon.in/Letters-My-Ex-Nikita-Singh-ebook/dp/B07938VDLS/ref=sr_1_2_twi_kin_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535473766&sr=1-2&keywords=letters+to+my+ex

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

We really need to talk about Flairs.,108,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,1494883276.0,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**

"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",7,4qepvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4qepvz/older_more_experienced_people_of_india_what_will/,14,1467222673.0,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

[Shower Thought] Subsidies and cheap favours by political parties make people happy enough to vote those parties most likely because people have low standards due to poverty.,22,6voqzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6voqzs/shower_thought_subsidies_and_cheap_favours_by/,15,1503580625.0,"Think about it.

So he is planning to abscond from his current workplace(as the notice period is 3 months) and join the other org as early as possible.

BUT, what he has done is, he hasn't told the new org that he has already joined another org and will be absconding from there. All the documents for background verification are of his previous org.

So, is there going to be any complications in the future after he joins this new org? He is worried because he has got one month salary and PF from the company he joined recently but has not disclosed the same while getting another offer. He has told them that he is not working currently and can join immediately!!

This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.
*Edit: Kindly ignore the [askreddit] in the title, wanted to write ask india:)

**Second Edit**: Sorry if i came across as childish or immature. Truth be told, i was drunk when i made this post and perhaps it impacted my replying to some of the posts. Some of you have suggested  
to talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love. Perhaps talking to her is the only way to get out of this misery. I have decided to do this in the next week. My birthday is in Feb. and I pray to God that by that time i would be able to invite her to my b'day party. I will give an update, irrespective of the result.

PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,43,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,1461362094.0,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

"NEED HELP - People working in the IT Sector who have absconded a company in the past, can you please share your experience afterwards?",6,9afobq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9afobq/need_help_people_working_in_the_it_sector_who/,11,1535320431.0,"I joined a MNC as a fresher with a 2 year bond of 1Lakh rs. Initial 6 months was training period after which we would have been put into projects. However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?

I know it's a long post but I need some suggestions.(I have been all over internet and discussed with other peers but couldn't decide on a final thing). Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.

[Mod Post] Introducing new flairs for better organization of content.,54,3ecyjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ecyjp/mod_post_introducing_new_flairs_for_better/,33,1437709097.0,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

---

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

---

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon.

**Edit:** We renamed the Regular flair to Scheduled to better reflect the purpose of the flair.",3
[R]Feedback thread the sequel. Results and announcements.,28,2o2rpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2o2rpl/rfeedback_thread_the_sequel_results_and/,256,1417579232.0,"Dear Subscribers,

Thank you for all the comments and thoughts on the feedback thread. Based on that here are the most popular suggestions and our decisions

**Edit** - **check out the clarification about user's posting history, please**

* Bring back old “United We Stand Banner” - **done**

* New link flairs  to be introduced - 

   * Old article (older than 6 months)

   * Technology (phone reviews)

   * Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)

   * Finance

  * Twitter

  * Sports

  * AskIndia


* Clarification on Flairs: User flairs have been enabled for a few months now. Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**

* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**

* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**

* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**

* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. 

* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** 

**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.


* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones. 

Thanks!

"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs",29,3huilc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3huilc/r_updated_wiki_rules_flairs/,98,1440193031.0,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

India and its Independence,3,6t9ik5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6t9ik5/india_and_its_independence/,0,1502585580.0,"ASK India. I am Indian, born and bred in what can only be explained as a regular Indian home (4 walls of metal and a few tiles of terracotta). I received public education as a child but now that I have read a considerable amount of literature on the Independence movement, I feel that it was taught in an extremely hateful way. Indians weren't completely victimised and they were treated with a fair level of respect. Has anyone else thought about it like this?",3
[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,166,66u52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,82,1492863549.0,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",3

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)

[NP] Which Tax Return to file if I'm both salaried and making money from side-gig?,6,6jnnbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6jnnbm/np_which_tax_return_to_file_if_im_both_salaried/,2,1498536793.0,"Hi, throwaway account.

Need some help / advice from you guys.

I am a salaried software engineer in Bangalore, but I'm also getting offers for freelance stuff. I am mulling over a few of these.

One of them seems promising. Three dudes in US are asking me to help bootstrap their startup, and I think I'd take this one.

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

I am worried about the tax return filing next year. Up until now, I have only filed ITR based on Form-16 from employer. Never had to worry about foreign payment for services provided.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018? 

Or can I just mention it as ""income from other sources"" under ITR-1?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

I am sure there are plenty of you folks here who have faced a similar situation. I google a lot (my google-foo isn't that good), and posted in some CA forum, but no reply.

Thanks for the help.

I'd like to stress here that though the process is considered simpler now, it seems far too bureaucratic  for a IT simpleton like me. From what I have read and understood:

* LLP or Private Limited are better than OPC (why?)
* LLP or PL need 3 people, while OPC needs one and one for nomination
* register company, get some secure USB token
* register trade marks (but no idea how to register different company names and products - like One97 and Paytm) for apt classes (35 to 45) or in all of them
* dedicated Office : needed or not?
* GST, VAT, etc :  what's needed and when?

And then there is freelancing and creating your own product - for which what and what not's are not clear anywhere. because presumably you'd need trademark and stuff there too and you also need TAN and PAN and DIN and current accounts and etc.

What I am interested in creating my web based product, and deploying it and making money. problem is I don't know if it is actually that simple.

Hello all, My sister got a 49,000 rank in JEE Mains with Delhi domicile. She has got MAE in IGDTU till Round 1, but hasn't been upgraded till Round 3. Our options below in order of choice filling - 

1) IGDTU - ECE Electronics - I was expecting her to get this till round 3 but haven't till now, so a bit worried

2) NSUT - MPAE Manufacturing Process & Automation Engg - Very difficult to get considering last year cutoffs - may get only after Round 4

3) DTU - MAM Mechanical & Automotive Engg - May not get - high cutoff

4) NSUT - BT Biotechnology - Not a lucrative branch, but I have preferred it over other slightly better or similar branches of DTU because of lesser number of students (= better chance of getting placed)

5) IGDTU - MAE Mechanical & Automation Engg - Allotted

6) DTU - PIE Production & Industrial Engg - All of below branches are almost alike in placement scenario as all of them have very less/poor Core placement options. Students from these branches either go for Software, other Non-core profiles, MBA or MS. 

7) DTU - Civil

8) DTU - EP Engg Physics

9) DTU - Polymer

10) DTU - ENE Environmental Engg

11) DTU - BT Biotechnology

Of late I have been thinking if we should prefer BT, Polymer from DTU (far better college than IG) over MAE (better branch than BT) from IGDTU. I myself am from an IIT but from Civil branch and couldn't get a placement from campus. So I would totally prefer a better branch in place of better college but MAE is not an exceptional branch either. And she won't get IT in IGDTU either. 

Q1. Should I move DTU branches above MAE from IGDTU?

Q2. Considering no. of students, should I keep NSUT BT above DTU branches?

Q3. I have read some post on quora stating that NSUT is better for circuit branches, and DTU is better for rest. How true is that? 

Q4. Is ECE at IGDTU good enough? (if she gets it in further rounds)

1) what the hell is with the landline, how could anyone be stupid enough to connect the landline with the router, fuck i have to keep the modem switched on a 24*7 or no landline connectivity. these fucktards ever heard of overheating

 * how is your wi-fi speed, please tell me it gets better  
 * and yes any data hoarder or torrent user, does gigafiber have port forwarding, i have made all firewall exceptions, enabled upnp and still not able to open a port

She told she loves me. She says she is currently not into me sexually. She has a crush on another guy, who lives in same building complex. She says she may be interested in him sexually.

[AskIndia] How many of you would support marking 50% seats in Lok Sabha for women,0,c1k14d,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c1k14d/askindia_how_many_of_you_would_support_marking_50/,18,1560780180.0,"When 50% of the population is women and not even 30% of the parliament is made of women, we have a major problem at hand.

The quickest solution is to mark half of all seats for women so that any party contesting it has to have female candidates. (Maybe we can push for marking some percentage of seats for non binary gender people as well, but baby steps for now)

While I expect most people to complain about merit or whatever. I'm wondering about people who can think past that. Yes, it will mean women will be set up as puppet candidates, but then men are set up as puppet candidates all the time. So we arent losing on anything.

I run a small engineering firm and make more then enough to live a happy, comfortable and also few luxuries. Worked very hard to be where I am.

So I found out that my wife is cheating. I am 39 and she is 33 and we have two kids, a girl and a boy. I am very upset. The marriage is broken irreparably. I want out.

I have an appointment with lawyer next monday to discuss this over. The wait of next two days sees unbearably long. 

Knowing my wife, I know it's going to be a big drama which I want to avoid at all costs. I just want to put evidence of her activities before her and part our ways silently. What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? I will also hire a PI the first thing the next week.

I'd like to have full custody of our children. Does anyone know under what conditions will I be able to get that?

EDIT:

Thanks for all your responses. Few were helpful, few disturbing and few others distasteful. Anyway, I am just normal at home as if nothing happened. I have a strictly predictably routine and I intend to keep it that way. I am off to drop my daughter at her friend's place who is celebrating her birthday today.

I am very methodical and I'll deal with this issue just like that. I am going to write down everything I plan to do, rehearse it multiple times with my lawyer (he responded), plug holes and build a solid case.

There are many suggesting that I don't monitor her activities as it's illegal. I can appreciate that. But I am anyway going to do it. What's important to me primarily is the evidence, the truth and the full picture. What I do with it is totally a different matter altogether. I may not tell her, I may just poke and see the response, I may not not use the evidence for legal proceedings (and that's up to lawyer anyway) or I may just burn it all.

Non-news should be a thing in today's world of instant news and instant shit. Sanity in this insane world that we've never imagined we'll ever be is non-news. And it should be yesterday because you've been through it and it's fresh in mind. I'll go first.

1. Yesterday I saw three donkeys after a very long time. I used to see and hear them almost everywhere. They've become a rare sight while I am growing up. They look old and don't look like they are in a good shape.
2. Yesterday I thought for few minutes why wasn't I am seeing monkeys in my neighborhood? They used to be everywhere in my childhood. That once again reminded me of a video made by one History professor on Pigeons in US. In early 19^th century 
2. Yesterday I watched a video on retrograde motion of Mars ~~mercury (and also sun)~~ again after a very long time. This time around I really wondered what it takes to observe such a motion. 

    a. First, curiosity of what's out there in the space; instead of just ignoring because it's been always there and can be seen everyday.

    b. Keep seeing one specific part of space, notice a specific object in the sky

    c. Identify the same object the next day

    d. Notice that that specific object has shifted it's position in fucking space and not a coordinate plane.  mean, you've got to have much more than a photographic memory to keep track of location of an object in space

   e. This comes before (d). The idea that I should keep track of it's location when you never knew it could move around/rotate/revolve.

    f. And the notice that the movement is strange. How many of us (in India) would do this in 21^st century? Apparently, this was observed by Greeks back in ~ 200 BC.
   
4. One auntie got mad at her husband/children and was screaming and shouting in no particular direction for a long time, even after they're gone. It seemed to stop at lunch time
5. I thought I should try making dosa using Chik Peas (Channa?) Yesterday I made batter and today morning I tried making dosas. It was a disaster. Was able to make just one dosa and it did taste dammed good. I am trying to make idli with the rest of the batter. It's work in progress.
6. All of a sudden Elpy mode is freezing my emacs. Need to find out why soon. I can't stand a monster memory guzzler Intellij.
7. Yesterday I bought 1KG really good tomatoes for 11 bucks.

I find it baffling to see a lot of South Indians on Social Media vociferously supporting RSS. In a Hindi-Hindu Rastra they are ethnic minorities with second class status. And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India than they are towards non-Hindus. Which begs the question, why is there even a single South Indian Bhakt?

As of now I have two years of workex, and an acceptance from a top 10 MBA college (1.6LPM Hojaega in a few years). My father however has his own project management consultancy, and is suggesting I join it.
I enjoy the consultancy bit, and the engineering part, but it doesn't pay as well as a Top MBA job would. So now I am confused, primarily because :
1. Dad's company = My company, plus staying at home (I've had loneliness induced anxiety before)  is a big thing.
2. MBA has a huge loan attached (25L+interest) which I need a lot of time to pay off.
3. Even if I stay home, I'll have to get some specialization in my field of engineering. So more padhai, along with work.
4. I can always work and make the consultancy bigger, expand it. 
5. From various people that I've talked to, once you're making good money, it's difficult to come back and start working for yourself.

[AskIndia] Is there an Indian equivalent of Hikikomori taking place in our society?,272,a7m150,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a7m150/askindia_is_there_an_indian_equivalent_of/,131,1545251798.0,"Hikikomori is a social phenomenon observed in Japan. It's a case of social withdrawal, where young people just stay indoors for years and years. They don't go out, or work (becoming NEETS - Not in Education, Employment, or Training), or socialize IRL. Their whole lives just revolve around the apartments they stay in (some alone, some with their parents).

Their reasons can vary - fear of societal disappointment, anxiety, depression, heartbreak, etc. It has much to do with the work culture of Japan, with its insanely long working hours, high expectations, conformity, and rigid social rules. I'd suggest reading about [Hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori) and checking out some of the IAMAs done on it. And the anime, Welcome to the NHK.

**Now, the point: would you say that this is happening to some degree in India as well?**

Some of the factors that cause this are common here. Japan is very different from India so let's get past that bit. However, we do have similarities. Indians are [increasingly overworked](https://qz.com/india/1030594/indian-millennials-are-overworked-and-sick-of-office-politics/) with most of our workers [burning out](https://qz.com/india/1401250/indias-unhealthy-workforce-stands-in-the-way-of-economic-growth/) from unhealthy conditions. [Indians are lonely](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/india-obsession-with-sons-millions-of-lonely-men-after-dowry/7903134) and many millions will, statistically, die alone. This is not to count the actual problem that we have no dating culture in India, and the fact that most men are unlikely to be well-socialized with women - who then watch movies about romance and start to wonder why their lives don't match up with what's on screen. Indian male loneliness is crippling, and prevalent, in my opinion.

Like Japan, we also have strong family structures, so that an unemployed youth staying at home and slowly rotting away isn't uncommon. In fact, in Kerala, I would say every family has one. There are cousins and uncles - people who for unexplained reasons end up doing nothing but staying at home. We have people who strike out into depression after failing the IIT-JEEs and AIEEEs or back papers, who stay home and seldom if not never come out. I'm sure many have posted on this subreddit as well. 

**One strange parallel I feel we have with the Hikikomori is the IAS aspirant**. There is a degree of social isolation and staying-at-home-for-years that happens with both IAS aspirants and Hikikomori that really strikes me. OFC not all IAS aspirants are the same but I know one shut-in and one on his way to becoming one, perhaps. Anyway this is just my view.

What do you think, though? Are a lot of young Indians locking themselves away from society as well? Have you ever felt the urge? Any discussion appreciated. 

I write as someone who's been unemployed for a good year now and I can feel the yawning chasm of social reclusion approach. Most of my year was at home, though I took gaps to travel. This was more a recluse from my career than from socializing, though I do feel I've been meeting fewer new people than I normally do.

I do believe that his is happening, though quietly. In a country like ours, it's easy to be forgotten.",3

[AskIndia] Situation with parents - Am I wrong?,60,as8cj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/as8cj5/askindia_situation_with_parents_am_i_wrong/,43,1550595226.0,"27/M/Mumbai/Single/Only Son. Working a decent corporate job. I make \~14LPA. My parents are now retired. I've lived with them my whole life.

&#x200B;

I've had a good upbringing but my main problem has been that throughout my life, my family has been a group of over-thinkers, which has caused anxiety in me (and I'm sure in them) over things like ""What will you do?"" ""What if this?"" ""What if that?"" in every social, career, relationship position possible.

&#x200B;

Till they were working, this was fine, but ever since they've retired, they are finding it tough to deal with such situations. They have a good networth, we own 3 properties (live in 1, rented 1), they have a good corpus in the bank and they've invested money in good mediums. We are debt free. They feel they will run out of money, inflation will eat them up, they won't have food in their old age etc. This leads to fights daily among my parents and I am in the middle of the it playing the referee. In their fights, they demean each other calling out each other's weaknesses and failed ambitions in life. I felt this would happen a few days after retirement, but it's almost been a year now and it's non-stop.

&#x200B;

I do contribute to the house here and there but I feel that it'll hurt my father's ego if I start paying for household expenses. My father restricts a lot of travel to other cities citing expenses. My mom tells me in her fits of anger to ""pay"" for her to travel to other cities. I have volunteered but never followed through cause they never decided to go anywhere. **Are they waiting for me to take initiative / is their ego stopping them from asking / will I hurt their ego by paying?**

My mom has to feel in control of the house. With the timings of the maid to the food brought into the house. Even on the ocassions that my parents are back in their village for a week or two  - it's non stop. She cannot let go of things. **Does she feel she will lose control of the house if I take care of things?**

&#x200B;

There's a fight every second week over something or the other and the parents are not on talking terms for days. They had one today morning as I came to office. **Is this normal?**

&#x200B;

Now, this is leading me to a situation where I am :

1. Worried to make any big spends of my own and having the independence to do so - be it a trip with my friends, maybe a property on my name etc. How do I tackle this when it comes up? I don't want to be in a situation where my mom is like ""we aren't taking that train trip but you are going on joytrips with your friends?""
2. If I get married and live with my parents (Which my mom pretty much expects me to) will this be a conducive situation to start off my married life?  Specially with their fighting and all. How do I draw the line and be clear without hurting their feelings?
3. Has anyone moved out of their parents' house with some level of resentment (before or after marriage) and kept good cordial terms with their parents?
4. I feel a bit burdened and tied down in my house cause of few of the things here and otherwise. I am not always the happiest person when I get back home and look forward to office even though it's dull at times. Is this normal?
5. I have thoughts of getting a new job in another city and moving there alone and starting afresh (easier to change cities than get another house in the city). Is this okay? Does this make me a horrible child for abandoning 60 year old parents at home after retirement?

&#x200B;

Any other general pointers would be appreciated. Thanks in Advance.

Troubled, Yellow!

""Where is your native place""

""Where are you from?""

These are common questions but I have no answer to it. I grew up in a different country, had my schooling in a different city, have my parents from two different parts of Kerala and have my (recently) permanent address in a different city.

I could say I am from the city I live in and have my family home in, but I've not lived here more than a year and know nothing about it. I could say I'm from the city I was born in , but again, I know nothing about it. When festivals happen here, I see them for the first time. I don't have any local friends.

I could say I am from the metropolis that I spent the largest chunk of my life in but then I am not Kannadiga.

I could say I am from the foreign country I grew up in and had my childhood from but then LOL that country doesn't give anybody citizenship. And I don't want it even if they paid me for it.

The more I think about it, the stranger the question of where you're from becomes, if you, like me, have no fixed roots. Where are you from if your parents come from two different cities? Where are you from if you spent many years in Bangalore but feel no affiliation to one city over another? Where are you from if you don't speak the local dialect and language of the place you are from?

inb4 ""I am from India"" because using that in a conversation is going to get you significant eyeroll. That only works on passport officers.

I think I can speak for many when I say that it's what I turn to when shit gets dark. Looking back over a decade, I can see that as long as I've been depressed I've had some anime to turn to on the side. 

I've never really become an Otaku though the last year has been tough and perhaps I've been on the path, as a NEET of sorts. Either ways, I felt there would be some here who would empathize.

One of the challenges of discussing anime is that everyone has their own personal list of must-recommends, and not many seem interested in your own lists. I guess it's like YouTube, everyone has their space and curations.

I've just started watching EVA. It feels nice to go back to the 90s for a change. And while I always perceived this as a 'weeb' anime for some reason, I watched a few YouTube videos on why people love it and realized it's sort of about depression as well. Four episodes in and I can see how compelling this show is.
 
The last anime I fell in love with was Samurai Champloo (which introduced me to Nujabes and the genre that evolved to become Low Fi). I watched that show for the music and the smooth storytelling. I wanted to be like Mugen - badass hardened street rat who's seen the world and is wise to it. But also like Jin, someone who has a deep inner calm. And a bit like Fuu, who creates the adventure, and who knows it's about the journey over the destination.

Starting a thread for people to talk about the anime they watch and how it makes them feel. Like, for example, why do you watch shonen anime - and do you feel it's inspired you to make your lives better?

I have even come across people who on being asked to put on the seat belt reply with 'There's no traffic police in this area, so it's alright'

Isn't the entire point of having traffic rules to avoid accidents and major delays in transportation? And yet everyone seems to be completely oblivious to this and then start cussing at random people with their arse seated in the car wondering how it happened in the first place. Literally no one is exempt from this phenomenon - rickshaws tuck themselves in everywhere, bikes try to slip between vehicles, almost all car owners leave little to no space between consecutive vehicles.

No one seems to grasp the concept of staying in their own lane, if people were caught breaking the signal or speeding above the allowed limit everyone would get stopped one by one - it's just a crazy shit show. I have had several occasions where I had to personally point out to the traffic police themselves that vehicles are breaking the red light while I was crossing the road. Am I really expected to be okay with this?

You can say that many youngsters are to blame, but I don't see any elder people following a lot of rules either. It's only when someone goes through a major accident themselves, even after which they will follow only certain rules selectively so as to avoid harm to self.

Why doesn't the locked Mukesh Ambani page on Wikipedia have a controversy section?

It is locked, fairly simpering in nature, and lacks any controversy section.

The equivalent entry on [Dhirubhai Ambani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani) is not locked but is also fairly blank in its description. 

Wikipedia is supposed to a neutral entry for human knowledge curated by the community. In instances where an article is repeatedly vandalized or at constant risk of vandalization, it can be expected to be ""locked"" from edits that are not approved by a higher power.

I'm not the first to mention this. One Quora user (in a post titled ""How corrupt is Mukesh Ambani?
"") described his attempt to edit the page and how it was stumped by higher-level editors.

In the case of India's richest and most powerful person, it is understandable that certain information is undesirable in the public realm. However, that does not mean we should bow our heads.

Finding out anything about the Ambani's is notoriously difficult. Sure, you could follow newspaper headlines over the least few years but they have a tendency of being fickle. Remember when Ambani's kid mowed someone over in an Aston Martin? Or when the family was involved in a [bitter feud](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19890831-bombay-dyeing-reliance-feud-ril-executive-arrested-on-charge-of-conspiring-to-kill-nusli-wadia-816444-1989-08-31) with Nusli Wadia (that culminated in a murder charge)?

The saga of Ambani is too vast to remember everything. Only a person who reads the paper every day for the last 75 years will know their true history and even then he knows just a fraction. I admit, I don't know enough. But I do know that there is a concerted attempt to control information about Reliance.

We see it in [Reliance ownership of the media](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/the-big-five-the-media-companies-that-the-modi-government-must-scrutinise-to-fulfill-its-promise-of-ending-crony-capitalism), in their purchase and regulation of our satire ([they even bought out FakingNews.com](https://www.medianama.com/2013/05/223-firstpost-fakingnews/) in its early days - understanding early that such sites could be far more critical than investigatory journalists and far more apt as well). We see it in [near billion dollar](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-row-anil-ambani-files-rs-5000-crore-defamation-suit-against-national-herald-congress-leader/articleshow/65546040.cms) defamation cases. We see it when books that try to tell this story [are banned from being published in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Polyester_Prince).

You know what is happening. I know what is happening. We all know it. Anyone on the street will tell you this and that about how Ambani pulls every string. And I will be the first to be realistic. 

**However, an open ledger of information does not have the same weakness as a media organisation that has to pay salaries.** 

Use a proxy and edit. Cite your sources well. What are you doing wrong when it is done in the name of the truth? But before this can even happen, don't we need to get past that lock?

To get an edit made through a semi-protected article, you need to propose an edit on its talk page. 

Honestly, if I knew enough and wasn't afraid myself, I'd make the edits. But I think there might be smarter and better people on here who could give me added perspective. I don't have experience editing Wikipedia and I believe in this happening to a fair standard.

"[AskIndia] As a pet owner, what rights do I have?",44,a6mylq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a6mylq/askindia_as_a_pet_owner_what_rights_do_i_have/,27,1544970655.0,"I didn't post this in groups specifically for pets because laws for pets in India may be different from those in the U.S or other nations. Please let me know if I should be posting this elsewhere. 

I am from Delhi NCR, and live in a posh society. You know, the kind with clubs, swimming pool etc. We are a tenant here and while shifting into this society, we did not take into account the kind of douchebags that live here. 

Anyway, last year I got a dog. (A golden retriever, and he is big now!). Lately my society has been imposing rules which I don't know if they can. 

1. Dogs cannot defecate inside the society premises. (Which if not illegal, I agree is a sanitation issue. However, at night I don't want to take my dog outside where there is no light.) I ALWAYS clean up after my dog when he defecates inside the society premises. (It is still a public place.)

2. ""Keep them off the grass"". I don't understand this rule. Unless my dog is actually harming someone or defecating there, I don't see a reason for this ""rule"". I have seen people with really well behaved dogs (like they (dogs) don't even give a fuck if kids are there, they just mind their own business and follow their owner). They do not keep those dogs on leash in the park, but again, like I said, those dogs are REALLY WELL BEHAVED. My dog isn't like that, so I keep him on leash at all times. But I would like to have a place where he can run around without leash, since dogs like him need a lot of exercise. 

3. Today, I took him outside of the society premises, like I always do during the day, and still the watchman came and told me to take him elsewhere, cause ""they are making a park"" outside the main gate too. This ""park"" is only going to be for the looks, no one is going to use it for anything really. 

So how many of these rules are actually legal and can be imposed on us? Don't I have any rights?

I have been living in a non-metro city for past few years and recently shifted jobs (Company A and B) and houses (House H1 and H2) both.

**Backstory:**

Concerned apartment (and other unknown businesses) is/are owned by a lady ""F"", whose husband ""M"" holds an ""Irrevocable Power of Attorney"" for all things owned/operated/etc by F. Account provided to me to transfer rent every month belongs to daughter ""D"" (no idea if it is joint account). M had sent me his HUF PAN card photo before the agreement was done.

Due to some issues, broker who showed the flat was out of picture during actual registration of agreement - which happened at sub-registrar's office and not online. M was never asked to submit his individual PAN or even present F's PAN.

All rent transfers were always online (IMPS or NEFT) from the my same account to the provided D's account.

**Actual Issue:**

From April 2017 to March 2019, I have been staying at the H1. The rent was initially little less than 14k and then after 11 months, me and my owner mutually agreed to extend the agreement (over a phone call), in which he also proposed an increase in rent of rupees 1000/-. Later, in a next call few days later, he asked me to 'pay rounded amount' as the rent which was exact 15k. I obliged to his terms all the times.

Now, when in January 2018, I had asked him for PAN, he said he'll talk to his lawyer and decide. Later, he declined giving it to me. Because I was not in any taxable slab, CA at company A only showed <1 lacs as rent paid and it was fine. This CA was not fine with M's HUF PAN as owner's PAN.

Coming to January 2019, I was confident owner would not provide PAN but still gave a call and to my surprise he said yes. He kept on prolonging actually giving it to me citing ""TDS would be cut"". I told him he's a Self Employed person, so no one is going to cut TDS from him. He still never gave it. LOL. So even for FY18-19, CA at company A used 8000/- as rent paid every month as I was still out of tax slabs (submitted original agreement copy and bank statement - was never asked to submit rent receipts, and no PAN was submitted here).

End on Jan, I switched jobs. Company B CA did not have a problem with HUF PAN and asked me to submit rent receipts with HUF PAN mentioned. Also, when I explained him the scenario, he asked me to address rent receipts to ""M"" instead of ""F"" as I had previously done.

Rent for H1 has been paid until March 2019, but I shifted to H2 (rent 22k) around mid March and paid equivalent rent there too. H2 has a registered agreement from March 2019 which allowed me to shift mid month because of an emergency.

**Important Note:**

I don't care how M or F move their money around (may be in millions, has political family and is from rural west MH).
All I care is saving my money and not paying his taxes - now that I am taxable. And not legally implicated.

**Questions:**

1. Whose PAN should actually have been provided/asked by me during registration of agreement?
2. Submitting rent receipts for first time: Legal issues for forging M's signature (for actual rent paid as he would never give signature voluntarily)?
3. Given that actual registered agreement period was over after 11 months but I was actually staying there for 13 months more and paying electricity bills and rents (all online) prove I was still a resident at the flat?

Question 3 assumes that I get IT query after owner declares signatures forged, declines I was resident or paid rent for period after agreement.

Thanks to all for your time and help.

TLDR: Verbally extended rental agreement has no PAN as owner/attorney does not wish to provide it. Forging signature on receipts for actual rent paid online every time. Implications?",3

About 10-15 years ago there used to be just a few swamis on TV once in a while, Now we have them 24 hours a day. 

Also looking at pop culture, I feel like movies from before 20-25 years ago didn't go crazy about God. The issue was there but these days the reverence, blind acceptance, following seems to be pervasive. True, there are movies like Piku and others but majority of them just don't want to offend religion. It's because everyone walks on eggshells when talking about religion these days, who knows who gets offended and kills/shames you. 

Do we have one popular figure in the country that claims he is an athiest? Hinduism actually accepts atheism to be a valid way but I strongly feel an ahtiest will not be tolerated today. 

Demography wise, from observation, people born in the 70s, 80s, 90s feel like don't question religion at all and do a lot more puja and vrath. They are more afraid of God and consequences, as all these hundreds of puja varieties sprouted up just to meet the needs of that people.

Details: A urban property has emerged with a sizeable share on my late father's name which is duly being transferred to my name. There is another shareholder who is related to me distantly.

Now dispute is neither me nor him is in possession of said property and third party has refused to leave said property nicely. A verbal notice has been duly given. A written attorney notice will be despatched in a week or so.

Please note: neither me nor my partner or original owner collected any rent. Nor was this property ever given on rent.

Now, as per one of solution suggested, it has been advised to pledge this property for a loan and thereafter default and push this property to auction where we(another member of extended family) will purchase this property and subsequently keep.

Is this possible? If yes, is this lawful? 

We just want to circumvent showdown with people who have this property in possession.

I will be travelling to India next week, for the first time.


I had planned to initially stay in Delhi for a few days as that is where I will be flying into. However, the air pollution is making me reconsider. The air seems to have stayed at extremely hazardous levels for the past couple months.


I am now seriously wondering if I should immediately hop on another plane to Jaipur to avoid staying in that air for even a day. I am also carrying respirator masks.


I'm thinking that the more chill, cleaner Jaipur and state of Rajasthan would be a better introduction to India and to the travel lifestyle than having to worry about my health in Delhi.

To some extent I can see how colleges with 85 or 90% limits might be pushing it beyond reasonable student error.

And of the people I know who didn't make 75%, it was usually because they just slept in during classes or were getting wasted or high the night before.

I notice people are quite opinionated on this topic here but I'd like to ask what you actually do when you bunk class. Someone once claimed that you could read your material online or take MOOCS but I somehow doubt that's what most people do. It takes a great degree of self-discipline to stick to a MOOC or avoid getting distracted online - and when you're in college I can hazard a guess and say that self-discipline faces severe competition for its attention.

So. No judgements. But what do you do when you bunk class?

I tended to only bunk morning classes as I suck at waking up woke. Sometimes, I'd miss an afternoon class if we ended up getting bombed during lunch break though I'd usually just attend it bombed.

Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.

**Childhood in my Hood, Spider-Man and INS DEGA**

As you can see, I am from Vizag. I was brought up and still live in the middle of an Industrial-Estate. My entire childhood revolved around [all sort of machines]( https://imgur.com/a/EdN3Xvj), machinery and welding sparks coming from the never ending fabrication works that went on in the hood. This sort of environment made me a naturally curious kid thanks to my dad and Uncle who both hold a Diploma in Mechanical Engineer for choosing the right neighbourhood. All my questions regarding these machines were nicely answered by my father and that in turn made me more interested in how things worked. This got a boost when I first met [*Spider-Man* and his amazing friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0FJNBRP8P0). This show and other Sider-Man shows had a huge impact on me, so much so that I used to play with common house spiders in hopes that its bite would turn me into a Spider-Man. Thanks to Universe, venomous spiders are not that common in a typical Urban Indian household I guess, I’m still alive and well. Besides that stupidity, Spider-Man being a student of science and using science to solve problems or for fighting villains made me interested in sciences and I started to pay attention in classes and made me question and think about things in universe and nature. This helped me have good foundation in Maths and General Sciences. 

On the other hand, our neighbourhood is in the close vicinity of a Naval Airport, INS DEGA. This helped me develop a love for things that fly. Our Neighbourhood used to be perfectly aligned with the runway path of the airport, this gave me really up close view of the planes touching down and taking off of the airport. Being a Defense airport there were special aircrafts in addition to the commercial ones. Navy Week was and still is the best season for some flight watching. At the age of 11, this interest in flying things pushed me to apply the science I learnt in school to make an object that fly with the help of DC motors it failed, of course. But that failure has set the path which I would follow in my higher studies. My father introduced me to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam who has been a huge inspiration. I may not know the name of the degree but I decided to study the science of flight and how to build things that fly. That was the idea of a child. 

**Finding an admission for Undergrad, IITM- Shaastra 07 & 08, Job Hunt & Masters in UK**

I was good theoretically but competitive exams are not my thing. I knew, I wouldn’t succeed neither in JEE nor AIEEE so any dreams of doing Aerospace/Aeronautical Engineering were smashed, my parents are kind enough to not force me into that machinery and left me to my choice for EAMCET. I just have to get a Mechanical Engineering seat in Andhra University or GITAM. That’s good enough for me because, Mechanical engineering also covers the science of flight and these two are the best engineering schools of my city and I don’t have to leave town if got an admit. 

So I found myself in GITAM, it has been a fun ride there. I always loved hands on jobs since I am a kid. I love to build something or do something with my hands. In second year of undergrad I attended Shaastra’ 07 at IIT MADRAS and it changed my outlook on engineering as a whole. I was awed by the students who built and gave a demo of the [VTOL flight built by them, Team YU-FLY?]( https://imgur.com/a/jj7DiUk) It was the coolest thing I saw. It was when I started taking an interest in research and technological developments in my field and in general. Target was set to Shaastra 08, me and my childhood friends made a contraption built by our own hands using a lot of Jugaad and tools found from the hood. Have a look here [GIF 1]( https://gfycat.com/KnobbyCompetentBear), [GIF 2]( https://gfycat.com/ImperturbableDefenselessIberianmidwifetoad). That was the demo video we sent in with the abstract. We are the Mighty mavericks but we got of Lots of weak links in the plan and it worked only partially. This set the stage for my participation in a series of technical events that I would attend over the last two years of my Undergrad. 

My communication skills were really bad by the end of Undergrad and this meant I wasn’t doing good in the Campus Interviews. I only wanted to join a core company and I couldn’t find any. I did the 5 day assessment for technical engineer post in IAF but didn’t make that list too. Couldn’t get a good rank in GATE. But found myself an admission at a really good Mechanical Engineering School in UK. Education Loan was the only way I could afford this and my parents had to put our house on the line to get a loan. EDWISE has given me immigration support free of cost as I secured my own admission. Went to UK and finished my degree, visited London twice and returned home. That’s it. I did not make much contact with the life in UK, its land and its culture. I was limited by time and money. But with the help of High-speed internet, I did learn a lot about world, science and technology, history and was introduced to reddit, student guilds, game of thrones and a whole lot of popular culture through university life. This helped with my English and subsequently my communication skills.

**Shock after returning home**

After finishing the degree, I returned home only to find that the degree I just received is not valid in India. Even a private engineering college didn’t want to hire me as a lecturer because my degree is not considered a Master’s Degree. That was a huge blow to me. I had to look for opportunities abroad again. Thanks to my thesis supervisor in UK, a well-known name in his field, gave me a good recommendation letter which helped me secure a full scholarship to do doctoral research in Australia. I was so happy and my parents were really proud of me.

**My way Down Under and How life changed there: RA Job, Research and Cooking**

I never thought I’d end up in Australia of all places. I went there with no expectations and the first few months have been the most difficult months. Then I made friends at student housing, who pushed me to apply for RA position and that changed a lot of things. I got the position and during my term I would be promoted to a senior RA and would organize the best parties and events over the next couple of years. This gave me a huge exposure to Aussie, International students and cultures from around the world. I had to be outgoing for the job so I became an outgoing person. [My love for cooking, adventure, camping and off road driving]( https://imgur.com/a/w6k2kIk) helped me go to some of the remote parts of Australia and make some amazing friends along the way. People around me at uni and housing were mostly younger than me, were not judgemental at all and I could do what I want without fear of judgement. I was earning good money while having the best time of my life and cleared my education loan in no time. [Perfect song to describe my time down under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpjvJdomfM) 

My research on the other hand was not going as expected. I am a hands-on person and I always enjoyed experimental work rather than simulations or numerical work. My research problem has been changed by supervisor from being heavily based on experiments to one that was half cooked right from the beginning which consisted mostly of Numerical work and only some namesake validation by experimental work. On top of that one of supervisor who is supposed to help me with Numerical work has moved to another university in another country all together and I was left with a supervisor who is Experimental guy guiding me on numerical work. From there it was a downward spiral and I ended up losing interest in the research I was doing. I produced two papers which in my opinion are not really great. 

On a parallel, I was doing really well as a RA, was cooking and trying some amazing recipes to whole lot of people from around the world and at one point [I cooked Indian food entirely made from scratch for the entire student village of 300 students](https://imgur.com/a/NqswIa9). Since I was a kid, I loved cooking and it was a life-long dream to own a restaurant someday and this idea was there in the back of my head all the time. And when it came to point where I can no longer continue my research work due to various reasons and I had to make a decision to change my line of work. It wasn’t easy, I had to consider so many things into account and had to find the confidence that I can cook commercially. 

**First Job in a Commercial Kitchen and How I found myself in a Road trip**

So I went searching for a job in a commercial Kitchen. After a lot of failed attempts, I went door to door along a popular coffee strip giving out [my new culinary resume](https://imgur.com/a/xVMIt9s) which I had to make up using the things I did so far. I got a call back from a Chef who loved my resume, my passion for the craft of cooking and gave me a job in his kitchen. Being the only computer literate among the staff I got to know the ropes of making stock lists, recipe cards, the numbers behind making a menu and running a commercial kitchen basically /r/kitchenconfidential. This gave me the confidence I needed. 

I rented a big motorcycle above 700CC which I always wanted to drive and just left for a drive. I covered 1400 KM in next two days along the southwest corner of Australia. This journey gave me the opportunity be with myself, think about myself and helped me come to a decision on so many things I wanted to do in life. The trip was really dangerous, I was driving 130-120 KMPH because I only rented the bike for two days and wanted to make the most out of it, I cannot lose sight of the road ahead because if I hit a kangaroo or things crossing the roads I’d crash at high speed and before I know it I’d be dead as Australia being so huge it would take hours for someone to notice me or get me to help. This fear for life made me so vigilant, self-aware and made me concentrate on the road like I never did before and that too hours on end. I was a different person at the end of this trip. I am not even exaggerating on this one. I felt like I conquered all my fears in life.

It was clear to me; I just had to do what makes me happy. I quit my research, quit the job in the kitchen and was finally on my way back home with the most daunting task ahead,  telling my parents about it, convincing them to help me start a Food Truck and to believe in my dream. After all is said and done, they still don’t get why I am doing this but decided to support my cause. 

**My Friend**

I could not do this alone; I needed a partner to do this with. The first person I got in mind was my lifelong friend. We went to same school since kindergarten and grew up together in the same neighbourhood and in a way we see thing uniquely in our own ways. He was not a brilliant student in class but he was the best when it comes to real world, he is creative, he can see things which no one else can in places nobody else even looks. He is brave and always helped me with my phobia for dogs; he has been a huge support in my life. I spoke to him regarding this and he immediately wanted to join me. He quit his job in Mumbai and came back to our city. He has his share of troubles at home, more than me and for that I really admire him for believing in my dream and to make this decision to join me on this journey.  

**Straight Outta Vizag**
	
I named our little venture Straight Outta Vizag because I truly believe this city has shaped my life so much, in a way it defines me and for that I love my city like how Peter Parker loves his city, New York. Although we are not the webbed vigilante we too try to do some good in our city. For our first socio-event, thanks to my sister and Good Universe, a NGO, [we organised an awareness campaign on women’s health in our neighbourhood](https://imgur.com/a/uKaRy2d) and it was a grand success. 

We started operations with this [Menu](https://imgur.com/a/WIlbGXU) and was getting a  good response. Then, Kerala floods happened so we decided to donate our earnings during this run towards the Kerala flood relief activities as you can see from our post history.

**Cold hands of the City governing bodies**

No matter how good our intentions are, we are not welcomed in the city. Before going on road, we went to various government offices like, Food safety and standards, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation- GVMC and its Public Health wing, City Police and Fire Department to get permission according to this [Notification by Hyderabad City Police](http://www.ctp.gov.in/PressNote/NotificationFoodCourtVehiclePermission.pdf), I found online. It appears so that, none of the people I met have no idea if such a regulation existed in my City, Vizag. No one official has given us direction with this regard. No one has responded to us properly, most of the people claim that no one has come to them like us, asking permission to put up a food truck and that they won’t allow it, mostly because they haven’t done that before. But there are lot of food trucks running in the city. 

[I submitted a letter to the Commissioner, GVMC]( https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) in May but got no response even after all these months so we started operations with only a FSSAI license in hand. Where ever we go Police or the GVMC personnel has asked us to remove the truck. Why are other trucks allowed then? Later I learned that other food truck people formed into Unions area-wise and are running things according to their made up rules within the area like a “dhandha”. Why do I have to join a union of a particular place or all the places if I intend to set-up my truck?

**More Social Activism**

During the month of August 2018, we had rains for a couple of days and our street got flooded due to improper storm drains. We have had this issue for ages and our colony people have approached the municipality but nothing was done. In lieu of this, we brought it to the notice of [GVMC commissioner through an open letter](https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) on our facebook and twitter profiles, which talks not just about our problems in the hood but also other problems that I have seen in my city. This time we got a response but I did not mention my problems with the permits because it didn’t seem right to plug the same with problems in the hood and my city. 

GVMC responded promptly and started the restoration of storm drain works in September and finished the work during the second week of November. Due to these works happening we had to put a comma to our operations and resumed our work during third week of November. 

**What happened after we are back on road…**

This time we wanted to try a healthy breakfast menu and we set up shop on the way between VUDA Park and YSR statue Roundabout on the beach road. We were asked to vacate the place by an Assistant City Planning officer from GVMC Zone II. The next day we moved to parking in front of YMCA on beach road and two days later, this time, a sanitation inspector warns us not to put up the truck and it will be seized if we do so again. So we removed the truck and went to meet the GVMC Zone-II commissioner, Mr. Palli Nallanayya. Here’s how our interaction went by: 

Me n My friend walk into commissioner’s room who appeared to be in a staff meeting. 

Me – ‘trying to hand him the letter we already submitted to GVMC’-- utters the words: “Sir, memu food truck okati start chesam mee...” “Sir, we are starting a food truck…”
He cut me off there and with a growing frown on his face he just utters the word “ivvamu”... “Alantivi ivvamu ma zone Lo” “Stop it there, we will not give you a permit. We don’t do this sort of thing in our Zone.”

Looking at his body language and the way he didn’t even bother to hear what we have to say made me sick and we left the room. 

Because of these obstacles we are now without a proper location for our truck. Many have suggested me ways to get a contact in GVMC who knows “how to get things done” But I do not want to go that route because it is not the right way to do it and as stupid as I am I will fight for what is right and we are planning to meet the commissioner regarding this and File a RTI with GVMC and City Police regarding what they know about already existing food trucks. Meanwhile, we found some gigs with adventure agencies and started arranging food for trekking and camping events in our beautiful and untapped eastern ghats.  We also cater to small parties, family gatherings, speciality events, college get-togethers and many more. We met some amazing people along the way, particularly youngsters who seem to respect and admire what we are trying to do which in turn gave us energy to continue on our journey. We intend to bring cooking and the joy of making food closer to our patrons and give them a well-rounded dining experience wherever they choose to eat.

Is MSM contributing to the radicalization of the country ?,14,9wphbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9wphbo/is_msm_contributing_to_the_radicalization_of_the/,11,1542147933.0,"Lately, it seems like you can hardly watch a TV channel or read a newspaper without encountering a ton of stuff with communal undertones.  Several of the talk shows seem to be doing it quite blatantly but there are also other subtle ways in which it is being done.  

For example, a majority of the questions on any given episode on a programme like KBC are based on religion and mythology. For a programme that claims to be ""knowledge"" based there seem to be very few questions based on science and technology. Is this what we expect of the younger generation ?",4

The thing is that from the beginning of my college life, I have been depressed. All around me people have been constantly talking about job. I don't want to pursue engineering. I feel trapped and depressed. I spend time sleeping or browsing Internet to distract my mind. Instead of having a goal in my life, I'm always thinking of dying; I'm always thinking of running away. I wanted to study math(and sciences), but due to people telling me to go for the college instead of course(and also because of me not knowing the difference between science and technology), I landed up where I am. And the thing is that now I can't do anything. I'm 23 and living off my parent's money. I don't want to disappoint them. My ability to think rationally has diminished. Now I cannot concentrate for more than a few moments before getting anxious. I think I am depressed but I don't know. I want to die but I cannot. I hate myself to be born. I don't want money or job or anything. I want peace. There is nobody to help me. All people around me think I am an idiot for not thinking rationally. They all want job and money. I want to rest.

We really need to talk about Flairs.,108,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,1494883276.0,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",4
Pride and Prejudice,93,6s6xir,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6s6xir/pride_and_prejudice/,76,1502154342.0,"I was having a beer while reading a book in the cafeteria in Deutsches Museum. A middle aged couple sat next to me. The lady said, ""Hello"".
""Hello"", I replied. The gentleman joined in, ""Studying in Munich?""
""No. Working"", I said. 
""Where you are from?""
""India"", I said. 
""Oh we are also originally from India. We live in USA. 20 years. Came here to visit our daughter and our grandchildren. We are originally from this city of that state in India"". I smiled and nodded and started speaking to them about that city in that state in India because I also lived there for 7 years. He started saying how much he misses his city and his country, being 20 long years in USA. I smiled and listened although I wanted to return to my book. Here I was sitting surrounded by the statues of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, Leibnitz and hundreds of scientists and mathematicians, the descriptions and depictions of their work in one of the best technical museums of the world containing hundreds of machines of the past, computers, ships, aircrafts, telescopes and what not and suddenly the gentleman said, ""No matter what one says, we are far ahead than them"". I was puzzled. ""What are we talking about?""

The man said, ""In shastra it is written - Everything comes from water and fire. Have you read Veda?"" and then he unfurled a shloka from Veda. I was quite amused. He then continued, ""Our Munis and Rishis have written everything about nuclear physics 5000 years back"". I interjected, ""That I would not know but I think that the contributions of the likes of Ramanujan, Bose, Raman and Chandrasekhar were enormous"". He skirted those names and said, ""I am an engineer. I have to tell you that India is at least 1000 years ahead than any country in science. One has to read Veda"" and then he fired another sloka. His wife was not getting impressed just as I was not making much sense of the sudden outpouring of Sanatan sentiments. 

I realised that it was better to move. But then he did not stop, ""You see it is a matter of what I call perspective. We knew thousands of years back what scientists here are knowing now. Chemistry, atomic physics, space everything we knew. At that time Europe was what? A dark continent. They knew nothing. We invented Zero, you know that?"" 

This is when I lost it. I asked him, ""Sir, you miss your city and your food and friends. That is quite understandable. But I do not understand why you have spent 20 years in USA and your daughter is married in Munich while you miss your country so much and you cannot stop praising it. Why don't you go and live in India? I also do not understand why you are even here when you should be in India digging Vedic spacecrafts. Why do you come to a Science and Technology museum in Germany to claim superiority on others' achievements? Indeed one can take the Indian out of India but one cannot take the India out of the Indian.""

His wife tugged at his arm before things escalated because I guess he was about to throw another salvo of slokas. They got up and left. I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. It is not the ignorance that hurts so much, it is the misplaced pride that left me dumbfound and sick in my guts. ",4
History of India where Indus valley civilization survives and latter is conquered by vedic aryans,3,9b4xnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9b4xnx/history_of_india_where_indus_valley_civilization/,2,1535535497.0,"Pre vedic age 1500 BC to 1000 BC
While the Rig Veda was composed in our time line during 1500 BC and was penned down during 1200 BC . The core philosophy of the rig Veda was formulated prior to 1500 BC and the scholars debate the exact time during which it was developed.While it is agreed that the core philosophy evolved during 1800-1600 BC . The rig vedas were written in vedic sanskrit which a closely related to the early avestan language.
While the rig Veda goes into details of the life lead by the vedic Aryans and contains hymns sung in praise of gods and some parts of rig vedas deal with philosophy and metaphysical matters

vedic Aryans in our time line left central Asia around 1800 BC well before Iranians left for Iran. While I don't want to get into the arguments of whether the vedic Aryans came directly from the andronovo culture or from andronovo to oxus river valley civilization and then to Hindu kush mountains and then to mordern day Greater Punjab and from there to the rest of India

But in this time line rig veda or any other is not composed during the 1500 BC but latter during 1000 BC . In our time line the vedic Aryans did not encounter any resistance when they settled down in mordern day Punjab as the remnants of the indus valley civilization had disappeared and only a few people resided in the Punjab. These people were absorbed by the vedic Aryans. While there was certain conflicts between the natives and the vedic Aryans and also the vedic Aryans and other indo Aryans tribes but not on the scale of Iranian tribes conflicts with Scythians, Elamite, urartu and neo Assyrian empire and also other people of the iranian plateau. These conflicts played a crucial role in the unification of various Iranian tribes .With the vedic Aryans the lack of serious threats resulted in conflicts between themselves eg bàttle of ten kings on the banks of the river Ravi.

Further since the collapse of indus valley civilization the urbanization in the Indian subcontinent received a huge set back since no major urbanization takes place till 500 BC and that's after a gap of nealy 1300 years from the collapse of indus valley civilization

In our time line The indus valley civilization collapsed in and around 1900 BC which was caused due to the change in the course of the indus river and also due to the change in the climate which occurred during that time period which caused the collpase of river valley civilization around the world and also caused the movement of various tribes including the vedic-aryans and the Iranian tribes . The collpàse was further accelerated because of civil war and diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis.

In this alternate time line the indus valley civilization survived though it initially suffered from the climatic changes and the change in the course of the indus river but it never had to suffer from the outbreaks of diseases and civil war . Thus the civilization survived and The people of this civilization adapted to the change and built new cities and settlements though the new settlement and cities were not in the size of the former cities and settlements But nonetheless the civilization survived and was recovering.
It was during 1700-1600bc that the vedic Aryans began to settle in and around the modern day Afghanistan in otl and by 1500 BC they vedic Aryans began their raids into the river valley civilization. Most of these raids were resisted and the vedic Aryans were driven back beyond the Khyber pass. The indus valley civilization at that point in time was made up of a single empire that sprung up from the times of trouble of 1900 BC . While much is not known about this empire but we know from the vedas that the empire was a centralised entity and worshipped false gods. The indus valley empire was able to defeat certain vedic Aryans tribes and Indo Aryan tribes and subjugate them. These tribes were made to pay tribute and in return the empire offered protection from other vedic Aryans tribes thus forming a effective buffer states.

This state of affairs continued till 1300 BC when the vedic Aryans in face of threats from migrating Iranian tribes and also from the pressure of the indus valley empire united under the leadership of Bharatha tribe . While this confederation intially did not cause a lot of trouble to the indus valley empire as the confederacy of vedic tribes were busy fighting Iranian and other indo Iranian tribes further north . These tribal war lasted for a century. While the vedic Aryans were not successful against the iranian tribes they were successful against other indo Iranian tribes further north and assimilated these tribes into vedic Fold further increasing in size and territories.

This increase in size caused concern to the indus valley emperor who sought to break the conferdacy up with tact and diplomacy and also by military campaign. It was during these times according to many scholars that major political changes took place in the vedic Aryans confederation. The vedic Aryans tribes over a period of time went from being nomadic pastorialist to settled farmers even though significant number of tribes were nomadic . The vedic Aryans were also influenced by the governance style of the indus valley empire and began to adopt the system of government of the indus valley empire. They aslo began to combine the elements of warfare practice of the indus valley empire with that of their own . Soon the vedic Aryans were strong enough to take on the indus valley empire.

In and around1200 BC the vedic Aryans tribes under the leadership of Bharatha tribe declared war on the indus valley empire on the ground that the empire was interfering with the internal affairs of the vedic Aryans tribes. At the time the vedas noted it was like an ant declaring war on an elephant. The empire though concerned did not make much of the threat and was thus ill prepared to deal with the new and powerful vedic Aryans

The vedas of this time line noted that this war lasted for 22 years but the major conflicts were decided in the first ten years and the last revolt of the subjugated empire occured in the 22 year after the war began . This leads us to a conclusion that the war was over by ten years and the rest of the 12 years the vedic Aryans spent the time putting down revolts

Consequences of the conquest of the indus valley empire on the vedic-aryans and history of the Indian subcontinent

A. Popularity of centralised state with a absolute monarch ruling a vast empire

Any person who has studied political science knows that vast empires create centralised state and favours absolute monarchy and vicea versa especially in a time before the advent of mordern day communication

In our time line the Bharatha merged with the puru tribe to create the powerful kuru kingdom in mordern day Pakistani Punjab but in this time line the merger does take place but there is no change on name as Bharathas in this time line were leaders of the vedic Aryan tribal confederation and as such name change is out of the question. While not much is known of the kings of the Bharatha tribe before 1200 BC but post 1200 BC there is a complete list of kings . While scholars of our time line and this time line agree that Bharatha tribe before it's meger with other tribes had a tribal council called sabha and samithi and it's society was egalitarian and democratic in nature but in this time line after the series of merger with other tribes and absorption of non Vedic Indo Aryan tribes and after assuming the leadership of the tribal confederation and more importantly the influence of the indus valley empire lead to creation of a new form of political structure ,the absolute kingship . While in our time line it was only around 500 BC that strong monarchical states emerged and it would take another two hundred years before the first empire known as the Nanda empire would emerge the same empire that Alexander the greats troops who were already de moralized refused to face the empire in war as it was said that Nanda empire had the largest and the most powerful army in the world but the concept of absolute kingship did not emerge with the nandas it was the Mauryan Empire the had the concept of absolute kingship and this evidenced by the hatered of the Maurays to the Mahajanapada and vice versa and also from Arthashastra

In this time line absolute kingship was known to the vedic Aryan tribes as it was followed by the indus valley empire and it's adoption by the vedic Aryans and the subsequent conquest of the indus valley civilization by the vedic Aryans caused a huge butterfly event . The concept of absolute monarchy much was unknown to the vedic Aryans is championed by them in this time line and this was the first major consequence and change from our time line. The consequences of this change are many folds . The obvious one is a centralised government is popular with the elites and the masses than in our time line. Further an absolute monarchy combined with a centralised state encourages unity and uniformity in political level and to some extent even in cultural level as religions in this time line in general and Hinduism in particular now champions the cause of absolute monarchy and a centralised state including large empires . Further with a history of centralised control and absolute monarchy creates an incentive for large empire because to achieve centralised control and to regin as an absolute monarch in a reasonable manner large empires are a pre requisite so instead of small to medium sized confederation that was characterized in our time line the history of India in this time line is characterized by strong authoritarian central government ruling a large empire

B Urbanization of the subcontinent

While in our timeline second wave of urbanization takes place around 500 BC but in this time line since the indus valley civilization survived and people continued to live in the 1052 or so urban settlement spread throughout the indus valley civilization at the time of its collapse in our time line. The vedic Aryans after conquest soon begin to adopt a urban life style and many more who are nomadic pastorialist settle down to become farmers in the indus valley whose population has been recovering since the times of trouble in the 1900 BC this massive influx of people from the west who begin to settle down and cultivate the fertile indus valley resulted in a revival of agriculture in the river valley not seen since the days of mature harappa civilization of our timeline

The indus valley civilization for all its advances in science and technology did not have much knowledge of irrigation system which in our time line was the main cause of its decline . While in this time line they did learn to irrigate the land and survive as a result their knowledge of irrigation was poor at best when compared to vedic Aryans who had good experiences and knowledge of irrigation systems as they irrigated the arid lands of central Asia during the middle bronze age . The vedic Aryans just like in our time line began to irrigate the land by building canals and small dams this brought in further lands under cultivation and made agriculture in the indus valley less dependent upon the unpredictable monsoon and increased the agricultural output from the land by many folds. This over a period of time lead to an increase in population of the indus valley but more importantly it resulted in further urbanization of the indus valley because of the surplus agricultural production. Thus the foundation of urbanization was secured
Further urbanization requires a strong central government as this was discussed in the previous point we can say the logical consequence of this that the central government will built new or renovate old cities to increase the control and to bring in further revenue in the form of taxes from industries ,trade and commerce
The retention of the knowledge and experience of the indus valley civilization has already been discussed in the beginning
These factors will cause an increase in the urbanization aswell as primitive industrialization which latter on spread throughout the sub continent

C Increase in foreign trade and consequently increase in the knowledge of foreign lands

While it may come as a surprise for many but the people of the indus valley civilization were proficient in conducting sea voyage and were experts in building rocks and ports . The best example of their proficiency is the docks and ports of lothal in present day indian state of Gujarat. While vedic Aryans who were not known much for their sea trade aswell as land trade . This resulted in the indian subcontinent being cutoff from the social and technological development of foreign lands as consequence of this isolation the social and economic and scientific development of the subcontinent was not shared with the foregin lands or it resulted in delayed or stunted development of the subcontinent in various areas .

An active foreign trade will have further accelerated impact on urbanisation as artisans and metal smiths and other industries have a much larger market to cater to and from the point of view of the government it will increase the amount of revenue in the form of taxes
In this time line the vedic Aryans because of the inhabitants of the indus valley civilization come into contact with Elamite, neo Babylonian empire, neo Assyrian empire, various Iranian tribes of the Iranian plateau and as a result of this contact apart from increase in prosperity as a result of foreign trade the people of the subcontinent also come into contact with foreign ideas and scientific development and the people of the middle East with that of India . While this will not cause huge butterfly effects in the political arena but the impact of this contact on religion and science and technology is not clear. There will be an increase in the speed of scientific and technological advances than what we see in our time line but in my opinion this will not result in major changes in the course of political and military events but rather a change in the standard of living of the people around the ancient world. To give an example by having contact with the people of the Iranian plateau who had advanced knowledge of irrigation systems the people of the subcontinent begin to use some of the irrigation techniques of the Iranians to improve the irrigation system of their own thereby increasing crop yields or using it to deliver water to the cities in a much more efficient manner

D. Socio religious changes

The indus valley civilization of our time had by the mature stage developed a very complex social heirrachy . While the details of this social order is not known in our time line and in this time line also the deatils are not known but the caste system that emerged in this time line may be same as that of the social order that prevailed in this alternate time line indus valley civilization but with certain changes. While this caste system is not as rigid as the caste system of our time line as it did allow individuals and communities to improve their status . It is a fact that the caste system in our time line was not rigid until the Gupta's lost power due to the invasion of hepthalites and during the islamic invasion of india this caste system further de generated into a ridiculously stupid system that emerged as a parallel power to the state authority but on the filp side it helped hindus preserve their customs and tradtion by locking them in a state of perpetual stagnation but in this time line the caste system will remain liberal when compared to our time line ,the reason for this is a strong central government and a Monotheistic religion combined with a high level of urbanization and industrial growth. Any person who studied indian history knows that when a strong Hindu state emerged the caste system always weakened and even during the zenith of caste rigidity that is during the 10th to 17th century the Monotheistic movements within hinduism emerged as the enemy of the caste system as the common doctrine of all these movements was all people are equal in the eyes of god as there is only one god we are his children. They stood against discrimination on the grounds of caste especilly the parctise of untouchability ( which in my opinon is kinda stupid) and had a common values and ethics system which kept them united and promoted group solidarity. In this time line as the form of government is centralised autocratic monarchy and the religion being Monotheistic the caste system is more like a class system and the practice of untouchability is never heard of and people of all social classes are given access to place of worship and other public places . Further in this time line the concepts of karma, papa, punya,janma , punar janma etc are present but they don't develop into a complex concepts which was used to justify the caste system as the concept of free will is more popular than vidhi or Brahma lipi or Fate in simple English fate ( but for non Indians reading this i do suggest that you google the concepts that I have written herein before and their impact on social development of indian subcontinent)

As I stated in the beginning the hinduism of this time line is MONOTHEISTIC and the hindus worship lord Brahma and regard fire as the image of Brahma and thus much like the zoroastrian people hindus in this time line also construct fire temples

The reason why hinduism in this time line borrows heavily from proto Zoroastrian ideas and beliefs is the fact that vedic sanskrit and early avestan language is very similar and since hindus of this time line are in more active contact with the Iranian tribes in the Iranian plateau which is the place where proto Zoroastrian religion was practised a lot of concepts of that religion makes its way to hinduism . While the gods of indus valley civilization are assimilated into the vedic Aryan religion as Demi gods

The reason why hinduism in this time line is Monotheistic and puts more emphasis on free will and good vs evil is because the birth place of hinduism or Brahmanism as it will be known in this time line is not limited to Punjab as it was the case in our time line but the whole of indus valley Afghanistan and Balochistan and further since the development of Vedas and other religious concepts are delayed because of the wars that the vedic Aryans fought with the Iranian tribes and other indo Aryans tribes and also the indus valley empire the vedic Aryans put more value in unity and order and the wars have a crucial impact on the society of the vedic Aryans in that the warriors and noble family establish their dominance over the priestly class as warrior are valued more than the intellectuals or people who recites hymns. Further since the place of development of hinduism is more extensive in geographical terms and is subject to foreign influence because of trade in this time line the vedic Aryans come into contact with proto Zoroastrian ideas of eastern Iranian plateau as vedic sanskrit and early avestan language are similar making it possible for the ideas of free will , good vs evils aand Monotheistic ideas to cross over from the Iranian plateau to the vedic Aryans tribes in the indus valley. What may also makes a cross over into hinduism is the concept of good and evil which has a similar concept in Hinduism of our time line as Dharma and Adharma but the concept of Dharma is much more complex than the concept of good and evil as the equivalent concept of Dharma is justice and the lord of justice is lord Yama the lord of the under world so if the concept of good and evil does make it into hinduism then it may become more mazadyasna than Brahmanism but in this time line hindus will still have the concept of Dharma and Adharma but since it is a Monotheistic religion in this time line the lord of the underworld and justice is also the lord of the universe that is the one and only God Brahma . So in this time line while the goal of moksha ( freedom from birth and rebirth) the ultimate goal of all hindus but the complex ideas of punya and papa will not be so dominant and makes its way to other concepts. In our time line the idea that deeds of a man in his previous life determined in which caste he was born in this life will not see the light of day in this time line as free will is the most important concept as God made every person capable of taking one's own decisions and if a person doesn't lead a life of righteousness he will be born again into the world . While the concept of heaven and hell is present , as a result of cross over from proto zoroasterian concepts with the concept of 7 janamas after which a person is judged for this deeds by the lord himself . Salvation or heaven or moksha means becoming one with the supreme being that is becoming a part of god ie Ahambrahmasmi which is a concept of Rigveda of our timeline remains a important concept in this time line also . As for hell well there is nothing much to say other than its hell.

While being Monotheistic the hinduism of this time line also has a concept of Demi gods that is souls of great individuals who on their death earn super natural powers but are not god . This is not a vedic Aryan concept and strictly speaking a Dravidian concept as is the case in our time line. Demi gods can be any person or an object or a natural formation such as an outstanding warrior , a great emperor, a great administrator, a mountain, a river , the sun etc while fire temples are not built for these Demi gods but shrines are build in their honour and prople evoke both the supreme being that is the Brahman and any of these Demi gods in their daily life . While intiallly any individual or object could have been raised to a status of Demi god if the people approve of it . But latter on in history the status of granting the status of Demi god became regulated by the Hindu religious order that is the clearical class of the Hindu faith interfered to preserve their power .

Being Monotheistic has an advantage of having simple religious practices unlike the complex religious practices that characterized the Hindu faith of our time line . The effect of this is there is no Buddhism or Jainism or any other counter religious movements as the main cause of all these movements is the pointless of the Hindu rituals and ceremonies whose meaning had become lost to time by then. A simpler religious ceremonies and better social system will ensure stability at the same time progress

The religious changes have been explained to some extent here and the evolution of Hinduism will be covered in other eras for example in the vedic period when the vedas are composed details of Vedas will be provided and in the changes during the Nanda empire era, the Greek invasion and the introduction of Hellenistic religion into the subcontinent and it's popularity in the indus valley and the Hindu Kush mountains, the Mauryan Empire era when the vedic hinduism reached its zenith , the civil war era when the challenge to the vedic orthodoxy became prominent, the Gupta empire era when the vedic Brahmanism was revived by the Gupta emperors some of whom were religious fanatics introduced the concept of forced conversions and religious persecution of certain religious movements, the prathihara empire which was more like a confederation than a empire they were tolerant towards the people of all faiths and it was during their watch that the Sassanian elite flee to India and the lands between khorasan and Hindu Kush mountains were absorbed, the shansabani the eastern Iranian tribes who in this time line remained Hindu it was during their regin the kings of India took the title shah Shahenshah ud Aryan ya anaryan, the various Turkic dynasty that ruled India from 1256 to 1730 the Turks in this time line some of whom convert to hinduism are usually tolerant in their outlook but some persecuted minority religion, the Maratha empire 1730 to 1905, the republic of India 1905 to present

The social structure

While not much is known about the social structure of the indus valley empire the vedas of this time line goes into depth as to how the new social structure came into being. The king of the Bharatha ,the king of kings of Aryans pratipa knew that the new subjects especially the elites will never reconcile with the vedic Aryans so he together with his samithi ( the elite of the vedic Aryans conferderation) formulated a plan to integrate their newly conquered lands into their empire. While intiallly they did not have plans of converting the people of the indus valley into their faith but latter on in 900 ad as brahmanism became powerful did religious conversion in the indus valley convert to brahmanism but even then majority retained their original faith . The vedas does make vague reference to the faith of the indus valley civilization. The faith described by vedas of this time line tells us that the people of the indus valley followed predominantly proto shaivism and shaktism while a significant minority also adhered to nature worship with host of other gods and goddesses. There were no temples or religious buildings where religious ceremonies were performed as all such ceremonies were performed in their houses or in outdoors.
The vedic Aryans flush in their victory engaged in rape and ,plunder of the inhabitants of the indus valley inhabitants and those particularly hit were the nobility as the military commanders of the vedic Aryans ordered their troops not to rape the ordinary inhabitants of the indus valley but it is documented in the vedas it self that the orders were disobeyed by a few but the orders did not cover plunder so as a result a lot of wealth was plundered from the ordinary citizens
.
The nobility and the family members of the army of the indus valley empire got the worst not only had they content with the death of their husbands fathers and brothers being slayed in the battle field now they had to put up with plunder and rape. It was this that came back to haunt pratipa ,the vedic Aryan emperor as he had to content with a hostile populace but king pratipa was a man of incredible intelligence while the plunder was going on the king emperor tried his best to ensure that no important members of the community are affected thus the traders, merchants, artisans, religious official, civil servants, engineers were safe and the merchandise of the traders were protected and this act of shrewed political calculation on the part of pratipa ensured that he wins the support of these prominent individuals who are essential to the running of the affairs once the dust has been settled .
The lands that once belonged to the indus valley nobility was confiscated and re distributed to the prominent individuals of the Indo Aryan tribes who happen to be prominent military commanders as well . While this does not lead to feudalism as only land is handed out not any legal or administrative powers and these new nobles are liable to pay taxes to the king emperor

The fate of these former noble families is tragic many were given away as wives to the elites of the vedic Aryans while the rest became peasants working in the lands that once belonged to them but some noble families who collaborated with the vedic Aryans were spared .
The caste system is as follows
1 These new land magnets formed the top caste of the society ,the fact that these families held prominent military rank aswell as vast tract of land gave them significant influence only next to the king emperor and his family in politics and latter on the top caste would also include top civil servants of the empire and the super rich of the society who were usually from the trading community and it was not unusual for these individuals and their families to be given the rank of nobility
2 The next in rank were the members of the military and the religious clergy and latter all the members of the civil service who are not belonging to the top rank and men of the books and science
3 The people in third place are the traders , merchants, metal smiths , tenants of the noble farmlands, peasant proprietor of the crown lands
4 The labour class
5 The slaves
While the details of the caste system will be dealt latter but for now let's get back to the indus valley
King emperor pratipa knew a revolt was only a matter of time so he began preparation to meet the revolt and also began to tàke steps to reduce the scale of the revolt

"How an ambulance rushed through 500+ kilometers of narrow roads in Kerala in 6 hours to transport a critically sick baby - A true story of unity, determination, and togetherness.",127,7dkd0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7dkd0z/how_an_ambulance_rushed_through_500_kilometers_of/,15,1510947910.0,"I had written this as a late comment on [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7decjh/np_this_is_thameem_the_ambulance_driver_who_drove/) which blew up to get 1000+ upvotes. Someone suggested me to write it as a post to get better visibility. So, here is it.

The baby was sick in a pretty good hospital, but possibly had some serious heart issue, and one of the best specialized cardiac hospital in the country is this hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. They have researched and developed even their own prosthetic heart. 

The hospital where the baby was taken to is a super specialized hospital made exclusively to research and treat the heart disease of kids. It's name itself is Pediatric Cardiology Medical College due to its specialty. They only take extreme referral cases like this one. 

This hospital was founded before the independence by Maharaja of Travancore because his son, crown prince Sree Avittom Thirunal Rama Varma had an untreatable heart disease since his birth which led to his death at the age of six and the Maharaja wanted no one to suffer the same fate, hence such a super specialized hospital to research such diseases was created in his memory with the name Sree Avittom Thirunal(SAT) Hospital at a time period when even normal hospitals were rare in India.

Later, another bigger hospital was also started by the last Maharaja next to this hospital with more departments called Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum. And, this hospital was pioneers of various things in the field of cardiac medical science in the world. The baby was taken to this hospital.

This was the reason why the baby had to be transported there instead of any other hospital in the country. It was just the best option for the survival of the baby.

**Air ambulance** was ruled out because of the critical condition of the baby who had much better chances with a land-based ambulance.

Kerala has a good road network, but the roads are narrow due to the population density of the state. At many places, it is just one lane in both directions. Any traffic can delay by a lot. The normal journey in this route will take over 14 hours, yet this ambulance reached in less than half of that time - 6hours 40mins.

This was done due to the help of some volunteers across the state. A GPS device was attached to the ambulance and the location was transmitted to everyone. There were WhatsApp groups with people around the state.

When the ambulance is near any of the volunteer's location, they will remove the traffic of that location so that the ambulance can pass without any traffic. This was how they were able to travel at such speeds through so many towns. During the entire journey, they only had to slow down once at Alapuzha. Other than that, everything went smooth. There are lot of [videos on social media](https://twitter.com/Advaidism/status/931063525493022720) of people controlling traffic at various parts of the state

Along with volunteers, police also helped. Police vehicles escorted the ambulance during the entire journey and traffic police of each district made the arrangements to make the roads as clear as possible. It helped the Ambulance maintain 100 to 120kmph speed.

This story is not just about the ambulance driver. It is not just about the driver who drove the police escort vehicles in front of the ambulance. It is not about any single individual. Instead, it is about what we can achieve if a lot of people come together as one force. It is about togetherness. It is about unity. This story is awesome because so many people came together that day to make this happen.

Few such incidents have happened in the past too. A Malayalam movie named Traffic (2011) was made loosely based on a real incident similar to this. It is an excellent movie worth watching.  Traffic movie was remade into Tamil as Chennaiyil Oru Naal, in Kannada as Crazy Star and is also remade in Hindi, with the same name Traffic (2016). The best one is, of course, the original movie.  Watch the original movie if you can, as it is a unique movie which is shot from the perspective of a dozen people in a way no Indian movie has done before.

While police firing led to death of one protestor there are conflicting reports on whether the woman killed was part of protesters or was she looking at the events from her verandah and was hit by a stray bullet.

>The people were protesting against killing of a militant in an encounter with police and army.
Officials said that police and army cordoned the Kharpora area of Kakapora this afternoon. “Some militants who were walking in a street fired towards the forces which were retaliated, triggering an encounter,” officials said.
“The encounter continued for two hours in which one militant was killed. However three others managed to escape from the spot,” they said.
The killed militant was identified as Adil Ahmad of Banderpora, Pulwama.
“As the encounter was on, hundreds of people from neighbouring villages staged massive protests and pelted stones on the forces in order to help the militants break the cordon,” officials said.

This will be long, so please bear with me. 


Many months back, I came across this [interview](http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/aatish-taseer-india-is-semi-literate-and-chetan-bhagat-is-the-best-it-can-do/20150205.htm) with Aatish Taseer, where he calls India a ""semi-literate"" country. I was quite baffled then, by his words. Why would someone with such deep connections to India make such a disparaging comment on its citizens? Its true significance has finally hit me and it's making me sad.

We're a country of a billion people with few opportunities and deep contrasts. However instead of trying to bridge the divide, mend the fracture and soothe the pain, we keep insisting on magnifying the gap and adding salt to the wounds. 

How did we become so politically incorrect as a nation? How did we let bigotry define us to such a large extent? How did we let education fail us?

As Indians, our single goal as kids has been reduced to clearing entrance exams without realising the kind of studies that we're getting involved in, to get there. We're not broadening our minds to ideas, we're not enhancing our understanding of ourselves, we're not experimenting with out of the box ideas on science and technology. No. As 15-16 year old kids, we're solving questions. Recognising patterns. Trying to understand the examiner's psyche in order to get the most questions correct, sometimes spending months and even years in those hallowed halls they call coaching institutes. If you manage to set aside all the hoopla around coaching institutions, they're merely *cram schools*. Even our neighbouring China has them. But we as kids, and more importantly our parents, don't want to be told of that. Because deep down, that term *cram school* conflicts with our idea of what education should be all about. I, like many millions, was also a victim of this. Yes, I made it though. But I'm under no illusion about exactly what I've achieved. I've crammed and smarted my way through entrance exams by recognising patterns and understanding ""important concepts"" without ever learning to think for myself.

And then the results are in front of us to see. This [video](https://youtu.be/Rfw5nQy5_pw) popped up on the front page of my YouTube yesterday and I ended up watching it. One of the kids here appears to be incredibly cocky about what he thinks of people who weren't able to qualify for IIT. I don't blame the guy, maybe a few years back I'd have behaved the same way. But he exposes how limited our understanding is, of education. Our entrance exams, be it medical or engineering, are tough *because* we have such a huge population. That and because the number of institutions of repute (even though the IITs don't even rank among the very best institutes in the world) in this country is embarrassingly minuscule. 

College education is a similar tragedy. Teachers merely teach. Students merely attend classes. Teachers get promoted after a few years, students graduate every year. The teachers have no incentive to teach, they don't get promoted because of the performance of their students, they don't get recognition for using exemplary methods of teaching. And yet they expect students to do well, grasp concepts and become contributors to the society, magically. Our respect for teachers in this country runs deep. Unfortunately, that blinds us to the gross callousness with which most of them do their *jobs*. As a result, we graduate not as informed educated citizens, capable of engaging with a wide range of people on a variety of topics, but as robots. Robots capable of working efficiently, without having the ability to position us in the grand scheme of things, without having the ability to question and without having a worldview. 

But enough about institutional education. What about how we think? Do we even know *how* to think? Are we tolerant enough and respectful enough to differences of opinion? Are we accommodative enough? Do we know our history? Do we know who we are as a country? 

In the comments section of the same video I shared, you'll see many plainly abusive comments about SC STs made without realising how bigoted they sound. The hatred for the lower castes is clear. The hatred, often, isn't even about reservations. It's about a group of people who we think don't deserve to be where they are, or more specifically, where they are being allowed to go. How oblivious, how shallow and how deeply rotten do we have to be, to pick on the weakest section of the society, the SC STs?

The tragedy is not that we are bigots. The tragedy is how we *fail to recognise* how bigoted we are. The tragedy is not that we are inherently casteist as a society. The tragedy is that we constantly *fail to recognise* how casteist we are as a society. 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ1EgsRT1zk), an interview by Ravish Kumar of an African student, exposes just how limited our understanding is of race. He is referred to as a ""gorilla"" in nowhere else but the capital city of the country. How can we as a nation, as a colonised nation in the past, not empathise with Africans? How can we be racist to a group of people who were treated the same way as we were by colonial powers of the day? In other words, how deeply has our education system failed us, that we have lost the ability to recognise our shared history?

If you go through comments on Twitter (and no I don't mean just the hateful comments directed towards a particular group of people), you'll realise how incredibly easy we find ourselves to be insensitive, even when we're not hiding under the hood of anonymity. An Indian woman, from a religious minority, was rescued by the government from a foreign country, in an astonishing attempt that brought out in me a deep sense of respect for government officers and diplomats. And then I read disparaging comments about her family on Twitter on the same day, by religious nut jobs. Add to that the hegemony, a certain group of people hold in our society, and the whole thing becomes scary. 

Bigotry and hatred, borne out of ignorance and pure cluelessness, have become a disease. And I will not even mention Facebook here because that is a cesspool of hideous ideas. Even some of my friends and colleagues, who I've known for a long time, have in many cases become absolute hypocrites, espousing hatred towards the disadvantaged and more importantly, towards the *different*. It's not about conflicting ideas of conservatism and liberalism. Its not even about the right and the left. It's about basic decency and having a semblance of understanding about our position as Indians in the world.

I do not excuse myself of this prejudice, of course. Having become a product of this system, I've also become a victim of the same kind of regressive thought processes that haunt many. May we all strive to, at least, *recognise* this, and if possible, mend our ways. 

We deserve better compatriots. Our children deserve better peers. And most importantly, this country deserves better citizens.

Let's discuss the state of Indian intelligence agencies in terms of cyber power.,51,5kssg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5kssg6/lets_discuss_the_state_of_indian_intelligence/,30,1482989774.0,"While almost every week there is a story or another about the NSA, CIA, GHCQ invading the privacy of the citizens, launching attacks against cyber criminals, putting people on certain _lists_ for using Tor etc.,  Indian intelligence agencies have been off the radar. I have a strong feeling that it's not because they choose to, but because they lack the skills.

Why do you think that is?  The NSA, SIS, GHCQ, FBI etc. make it a point to hire top security professionals and even hire interns directly from universities. The candidates selected consider it as a good career path, both in terms of serving the nation and in terms of intellectual satisfaction. Compare it with the state in India, where RAW and IB don't even have a dedicated website. I understand the need for secrecy, but at least have a fucking portfolio! One cannot even directly apply to RAW. One needs to join some other government department and then one gets transferred. (like seriously?). Just have a look at [NSA](https://www.intelligencecareers.gov/nsa/), [GHCQ](https://www.gchq-careers.co.uk/recruitment-process.html), [FBI] (http://www.fbiagentedu.org/careers/cyber-crimes/), [SIS](https://www.sis.gov.uk/science-and-technology.html) career websites and then look at Indian [IB's](http://mha.nic.in/vacancies) (No, there isn't even a webpage specific to IB and like I said, one cannot directly get into RAW). Would a person who is **actually** skilled even want to apply or work here? I don't think so.

I believe that India has not paid enough attention to strengthening its cyber power. I believe that we need to have some _Kevin Mitnick_ sort of personalities to wreak havoc on the cyber security front by unlawful activities. (Instead of fakers like Ankit Fadia). Why?

* There's huge money to be made in it.
* The Indian intelligence agencies won't be able to catch you (unskilled that I think they are).
* Even if they figure out you were behind it, you could easily hide in the 1.252 billion population that India has. 
* The infrastructure to attack is highly outdated and vulnerable (For instance [this](https://www.troyhunt.com/43-203-indian-patient-pathology-reports-were-left-publicly-exposed-by-health-solutions/).).

My worst fear is that if there is a war in the future, it will be a cyber war, and India will be left devastated. It's not that we don't have the skills, it's just that the government needs a slap on its face. Like seriously, our government needs to change. How can a few babulog sitting behind desks who have no clue about technology properly shape the laws concerning cyber security and privacy? Why can't our leaders debate about such technical issues during election campaigns (like Hillary and Trump did) ? They don't because they don't feel such issues are important enough. Like I said before, we need some big hacks to happen in order to stir things up.",4
Anti-intellectualism in India,14,711g4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/711g4o/antiintellectualism_in_india/,8,1505835828.0,"Welcome the country where 'hard work is greater than Harvard'. (Oh! The Irony.) In a country where the top man expresses such a ridiculous sentiment, no wonder we see WhatsApp messages becoming policy (demonetisation) and ridiculous blog posts becoming sufficient to call into question decades of dedication (the defamation of JL Nehru). 

What I fail to understand is the reason behind rising anti-intellectualism in this country. 

Take history, for example. Historians like Romila Thapar reach their conclusions after years of research, have them validated through peer review, and they are held in high esteem across the world. But in our country, random Quora posts are enough to call their work into question. 

Now, education does not make you more intelligent than others. But it definitely gives you expertise, because of the time and 'hard work' you put into a learning about a subject. 

What is education worth if we don't recognise this? Why spend years and years doing 'hard work' if at the end of the day people are going to give more value to some hairy baba spouting ridiculous crap. 

We talk about our great contribution to science and technology, to philosophy and mathematics, but I fail to see any similarities between the great ones of the past and the petty folk of today. 

Everything is really sad and disheartening.

This is the Story of my relationship with religion - A Long Read!,20,6nu3gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6nu3gu/this_is_the_story_of_my_relationship_with/,12,1500337123.0,"This is the Story of my relationship with religion:

I was in my 2nd Standard at an excellent Jesuit school in Ahmedabad when my class teacher Mrs Sinha asked “How many Hindus in this Class?”. It was for some Government count as far as I can remember. A majority of my classmates raised their hands. Then she asked “How many Muslims in this class?”, a few raised their hands. She proceeded to ask 1 or 2 more questions. I didn’t raise my hand at all. I didn’t know what those words meant, I didn’t know ‘what I was’. My bench partner on the day noticed this and complained at the end: “Ma’am, he didn’t raise his hand”. “What are you?”, Mrs. Sinha barked at me. “I don’t know”, I replied. She looked into my admission documents as I’d just joined that School and got back “You’re Muslim!”. That day I returned home and told my mother what happened. I asked her: “Mumma, what is Muslim?”, “It’s a name beta, we are Muslim”, she replied. That was how I discovered religion.


I was born & raised in an elite locality of Ahmedabad, which was predominantly Hindu but had a mix of a few others at the time. My first few years were spent in ‘Shri Krishna Apartments’ where out of 300-odd Apartments, we were the only Muslim family and this never became a problem with any neighbour ever. Our neighbours loved us and we loved them. Then in 1992, my grandparents’ home got burnt down in another mixed locality in Ahmedabad, right behind the famed IIM Ahmedabad. Some neighbours too came and joined in the loot, they were told. By this time, I had also learnt that my great-grandparents' home in the old city of Ahmedabad had been burnt a good 5-6 times over the years. Coming back to my immediate family, in 1992 our neighbours still stood by us but some people in the adjoining neighbourhood had noticed that we were Muslim and began threatening my parents to leave the place. They would wait outside our gate to threaten us when we passed. The builder of our Apartment - Kiran bhai stood by us and told us “Don’t you worry, I will deal with them”. But things kept building up. A few days later, when my father was driving his car, he was brought to a standstill thanks to a huge jam. It turned out that some BJP/VHP workers had stopped all cars and were climbing on the windshield of each to paint a Swastik. He was obviously shit scared but he stayed calm, waited for his turn to arrive, quietly got the swastik painted on his car too and then sped away like a madman.

On another scary night when rumours were growing of more riots brewing across Ahmedabad, we ran away to a family friend’s place. He taught at IIM Ahmedabad and my parents must’ve thought his on-campus-home would be a good place to hide at. Somewhere in the midst of our conversation with our hosts, loud noises from what seemed like a large group of people started coming from a distance. My parents were certain that a mob had entered IIM-A, maybe they’d heard about us hiding there. Our hosts too were obviously scared and the predicament we had put them in further troubled my parents. Then our host got an idea and said “Let me dial the watchman at the gate and ask where the mob has reached”. When he called, the watchman told him that the noise was from a Basketball match that was going on in the IIMA Campus.

Eventually things took a decisive turn. When we returned home one night, there was a paper stuck on our door, which said something on the lines of: “Last warning! Leave or else!”. That this had reached our doorstep was the last straw and my parents relented. Still, my mother was adamant that she does not want me to grow up in a ghetto and hence we moved to another mainstream locality, near the famed NID this time. Our lane was a mix of Hindus and Muslims at the time. One of the first neighbours we befriended was a lovely inter-religious couple - Indian Architects who studied in Paris. Their home in a similar Hindu-majority locality had just been attacked and they too had fled and come to this new place.

Although I was just four at the time, all these things made me further aware of Religion as a concept. As I grew up, often I was asked after a first introduction: Arastu??? Are you Parsi? First, I used to say “No, I’m Muslim”. As I grew up further, I would often lie: “Yes, I’m Parsi”. Sometimes I would say: “No no no no, I am Hindu!”. A few times when I dared to let it out: “No, I am Muslim”, I’d generally get a second response: “Oh! You don’t look Muslim”. Sometimes there would be no response but just a weird look on their face.

But regardless of whatever I said, I never felt as if I belonged to any religion. My family didn’t pray, we didn’t fast. The only time I would go to a mosque would be when my father used to take me on Eid mornings and I’d look around and rise, kneel and appear to murmur copying whatever others around me did. Post 1992, in the new Society we had moved to, gradually all Hindus moved out and it became a Muslim-only lane. So all of the boys used to gather, pray, fast and stand outside the mosque. But never me. They’d bully me from time to time, although my father’s hostility to everyone also contributed to that. I remember being bullied even for things such as wearing shorts! “Maulana says we shouldn’t wear shorts”, they’d say. “Maulana says we shouldn’t watch TV”. Sometimes when the Maulana from the nearby Madrasa used to drive by on his bicycle, they’d abandon the cricket match we were playing and hide inside the car parking waiting for the Maulana to pass. I’d be the only one still standing there wondering what just happened! We had two lovely dogs for a while and multiple complaints were made since dogs and their drool are considered unholy in Islam. I remember being called a ‘Kaafir’ and much more multiple times while growing up. My relationship with religion then could best be described as ‘indifferent’.

I remember two more instances during that period. One was when we had made a rare visit to one of our Muslim neighbour’s home and their daughter asked me to confirm the rumours she’d heard: “Tum namaz nahi padte?”, I said “Nahi”, she went on “Tumhe pata hai na ke 2 Jumme (Friday) tak namaz na pade toh Musalman nahi rehte”. My usually ultra-aggressive father too stunningly remained shut and just made an awkward face. 'Namaz nahi padhoge toh yeh hoga, aisi saza milegi, waisa gunaah chadega' - Have heard this umpteen times, yearned for someone to tell me what good it will do or at least expected them to tell me to pray out of gratitude and not fear but no one ever did, not one time. The second instance was when I got into a fight with a classmate from School over something on our Football ground. He came, pushed me to the ground and yelled: “Saale miye, ghar jala dunga tera”. I remember my first reaction to that being: ‘Shit, now the others too know I’m Muslim’. That fact had been considerably concealed otherwise because my name seemed secular (deliberately so, my mum had insisted I have that kind of a name) and my appearance or accent didn’t betray signs matching any stereotype people had in their heads either.

I don't remember seeing a Muslim girl in my lane after the age of around 10-12. They were either in burkhas or just indoors. I saw some of them the only time in their own weddings but there too, almost always, their faces and heads would be hidden. I remember another instance from this time. I have addressed my mother as ""Mumma"" my entire life, at times that ""Mumma"" would get abbreviated to ""Mu"" pronounced as ""Mo"" of ""Mother"". My school auto had come to pick me and as I came out, my mom waved goodbye and I said ""Bye mu"". A Muslim auto-mate laughed: ""Yeh toh Hinduyo ki tarah mummy ko 'Maa' bolta hai!"".

Then around 1998, I remember that one day when I heard that my best friend’s parents’ general store had been burnt down. There was no riot in the city, just a minor communal rumour somewhere and just that one shop had been burnt. I remember going to their rival’s store next door to buy something the next day. As I stood there, that shop-owner was speaking to another man and their conversation went on the lines of “You saw what I did!”, “Ya but I gave the Kerosene” came the reply.

Sometime around this, I discovered one day that my father, who had a habit of making powerful acquaintances had been communicating on inland letters with the then RSS chief K. S. Sudarshan. He used to keep some of those letters with him whenever a communal rumour flew around. Those letters would help him escape a potential mob he thought! Sudarshan called us one night for dinner to an RSS headquarter somewhere near Ahmedabad. We were escorted by a car, the time was around 8.30 PM when we reached. I remember walking past a group of about 20-30 stick-wielding men in Khaki chaddis practicing their drills, it was really scary for a child. As we walked in, Sudarshan was seated on a sofa in a reasonably austere room. 3-4 people sat around him. The first question we were asked was: “Aap ka ghar aur office kaha hai?”, my dad replied and two men got up and went to the other room, returning after a while. Till this day, it is my suspicion that none of our properties were ever targetted because of something those men noted down that night.

This became something that possibly helped us just a few years later. It was around 4.30 PM on the 27th of February 2002. I was about to leave for my tuition class when my mother called me from office. “Beta, don’t go, there’s some news of a riot, we too are returning home”. By then, I knew the drill, I cancelled all my plans and just stayed indoors. I remember my parents coming home soon after and us having a very interrupted half-sleep that night. When we woke up the next morning and stepped outside our ground-floor home, I could see thick, black smoke on 2-3 sides. One of those seemed to be from quite close by, could it be my father’s office building we suspected, as that was just at the next crossroads. Soon we heard from neighbours that every single Muslim establishment in that building had been burnt down except my father’s office. Maybe it was the note those two men made that night that helped, maybe it wasn’t.

The local TV Cable channels were playing ‘Gadar’ that day. Soon after, neighbours began gathering in the entire lane. Despite being raised by an abusive father, the tension I felt at that moment as a fourteen year old was new to me. I was scared for my life and that was because some people suddenly wanted to kill everyone who had the name I was born with! People around me were talking in a language I didn’t understand. There were talks about where we could run, who lived in what direction, people from what religion stayed in which neighbouring lanes. I had never felt more aware of my surroundings! Women and children were asked to go to the terraces to prepare kerosene bottles and throw them in case a mob attacked. Some of the more enterprising men said they will stand guard on both sides of our lane. ""Mob aa bhi gaya toh yeh aadmi kya kar lene waala hai!"" was the hushed response to that offer!

I remember my father trying to be brave and walking to one end of the lane that evening. He returned soon after and said he saw the now slain BJP Leader Haren Pandya leading a mob that was gathering at the crossroads just outside. It was many years later when my father happened to meet Mr Pandya when he told him: “Had I not been there that evening, your lane would have been burnt, I was trying to pacify the mob and steer them away”. But seeing that mob then obviously scared my father. In the meantime, my mother tried calling one family friend - A senior policeman. Always in the past, when we had called him in similar situations, he had immediately gotten a police point set up just outside. This time, to my mother’s astonishment, he replied: “Sorry, this time there’s nothing I can do”. My mother knew right then, this was different! After 10 years, it was now time for us to run again. 

That same inter-religious couple who were our first friends in the whole lane approached us saying that one of their friends leads the Police Academy, lives in the Muslim ghetto of Juhapura in Ahmedabad and has offered to host us in his farmhouse. Then we tried asking some families in our lane if they wanted to join because some space could have been arranged for them too. All of them said ‘No’. Some said they were worried about the black money, jewellery etc in their homes, some said they didn't want to run, some just didn't like my father. The police academy chief was smart, he made the watchmen outside his home wear police clothes and drive down to our home in his police car. We then rode in our car escorted by them and left our home yet again. I remember seeing this burning flame in a provision store owned by a Muslim uncle right outside our lane. I also remember seeing 2-3 mobs of 4-5 men on our way, all had trishuls in their hands, all wore saffron headbands. Suddenly this mystical area of ‘Juhapura’ seemed to be a saviour. 

I had never visited this area ever before. As we entered Juhapura, I remember someone in the car saying “Yeh border hai, hum aa gaye Juhapura”. The relief I felt entering a place I’d never been to still remains fresh in my mind.

I remember the next few nights. We stayed awake late into the night sitting on our host’s porch. We could see burning yellow lights (maybe flames) and hear loud noises and chants of mobs from 2-3 kms away, I discovered new practical laws of Science. The days would be no different. Every now and then black clouds of smoke could be seen in the distance and then it’d be a guessing game: “Woh Cargo Motors jala hoga”, “Woh so-and-so dukaan gayi hogi” and of course the phone too kept ringing. Gujarati newspapers too did their thing. I remember one popular Gujarati daily having a photo of a terrace taken from many terraces away with what seemed to be the vague figure of a man wearing something white having something in his hand and the following (translated) headline on their front page: “Who is this gun wielding Muslim?”. We returned to our home after a week or so, I was about to enter our door when one of our next-door neighbours saw us and screamed aloud: “Lo bhagode aa gaye vapas” (‘See, those who ran have returned’).

There had been no damage done to our lane but a few homes had been vandalized in the vicinity. One of them belonged to a school friend and classmate of mine, “One of the neighbours took our TV”, he told me much later. A few days after returning, I remember my mother speaking to a family-friend from our previous home - the one we had fled in 1992. She said they were so scared for their lives and even stopped going for their morning walks because they heard strong rumours of trucks full of Muslims coming to burn them from Juhapura. I think I almost laughed. I also remember how one night, many months later, when my father and I opened the door to the room where my mother was sleeping, she woke up startled, stood up and started howling at the top of her voice. She thought we were rioters who came to kill her. After pacifying her then, we eventually laughed it off over the years.

Two memories stand out additionally from this time. It was somewhere in March 2002 I think. We barely left home and everything seemed gloomy all the time. I got a call from a school classmate of mine inviting me to his birthday party. I couldn't understand his frame of mind and I think he couldn't understand mine. The second memory relates to yet another major change that happened in my life. My parents didn't feel comfortable sending me to my beloved School anymore as it was in a Hindu area. Remember this was March, final exam time was close and I was in my 9th grade. My father had a few calls with my school administration, they understood and gave me a promotion that year. For the next academic year, I was moved to another Jesuit school in the old city that had a healthy Muslim population. I have been asked several times why I made this strange move since the school I left was the one everyone wanted to go to, I have often cooked different stories up each time.

Soon after, my parents began working at riot relief camps. I remember my mother going to those camps quite often. I had been once, some NGO was getting kids there to draw. I remember this one girl having drawn a red haired monster. Soon my dad revived his old NGO and took it up full-time with my mother. I remember this one survey my father got conducted with some pedestrians around Ahmedabad. One of the questions was: “What do you think of Juhapura?"" (the same area we had escaped to). Some of the answers were: “It’s mini-Pakistan” to “There is a helipad there where helicopters from Pakistan bring missiles for war with India”. I also remember us stumbling upon these pamphlets from somewhere. They claimed to be published by the VHP/Bajrang Dal and their text in Gujarati read something on the lines of: ""These Muslim boys are very handsome and they fool and take away our Hindu girls later converting and marrying them. Let us open Gyms and beauty centers in Hindu areas too so that our boys too become handsome.""

Life moved on. Social activists began coming home, some film folk came too, there was lots of activity. An year later, mom and I finally left my father. Much later I discovered what had triggered that high a sense of empowerment and confidence within her after having been trodden upon for so long. She told me that in one of her visits to the relief camps, a woman came up to her and began howling: “Aap educated Muslim aurat hai, aap hamari haalat dekho, aap hamari madad nahi karenge toh kaun karega!”. 

That moment, she was liberated! The pain of 2002, the pain of that woman gave her a strange sense of empowerment. She realized that she did not need to bear anything, her pain wasn't the largest, she could be free, she could empower others too, she could still have a happy life!

Eventually she joined an iNGO and soon started the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (Some of you may know the name from the recent Haji Ali and Triple Talaq cases). I was fifteen when we left my father. Life became shockingly kind to me ever since I got out from those clutches. It was truly beautiful, I wasn’t good-for-nothing as I had been made to believe, I had skills too, I was liked too. After this ordeal, a lot of acquaintances too opened up to me on their respective domestic issues, I realized I wasn’t alone. After a period of selfish enjoyment to satiate my sense of being deprived, I became really passionate about empowering young people and started a non-profit. We worked for 6 years with about 6000 College youth educating them about issues such as Communalism, Gender, citizenship, even happiness.

I remember this one time when we took a group of Hindu youth from a mainstream College to Juhapura for an interaction with about 20 local girls from there. On the eve of our meeting, a lot of their parents warned them: “Are you sure you need to go?”, “Be careful, very bad people stay there” and so on. Most of them still came, we still went. That interaction was amongst the most beautiful moments I have ever experienced. These folks connected with those girls on so many levels. They were laughing, sharing anecdotes. Those girls said how they have never gone out of Juhapura, these youngsters shared how their problems seemed so much like their own. As we left, they hugged and invited each other to their respective social functions. The walls had been broken, at least for those 10-15 people we had taken that evening. I remember this other time when I took the same group to visit the worst-hit Naroda Patiya riot-victims. Every single victim, without exception, said: “Hindus aren’t the problem. There are good and bad people amongst both. This was the work of politics and politicians”.

On the opposite end, I remember this time when my grandfather came home one evening. Although he once prided himself on being irreligious, by this age he had a long beard and was always in a traditional white kurta-pyjama. He told my mother: “Beta yeh NGO ka kaam toh thik hai par Arastu ko bol thoda deen (religion) ka bhi kaam karey”. My mum replied: “Papa, aap ne jitna religion ka kaam apni zindagi mein kiya hai, us se zyada isne itni umar mein is NGO se kar liya hai”. I also remember how members of the Tablighi Jamaat would come to my home sometimes. Their job was to propagate Islam further and despite knowing I have never once prayed, fasted or gone to the neighbourhood mosque, they kept coming trying to patronize me into coming to the mosque. I remember one particular line said by an elite member of their group: “Aaj kal Musalman bachho ka dhyan bohot zyada Science aur Technology pe aa gaya hai. Woh sab toh theek hai par deen (religion) pe dhyan do pehle”.

As time passed, my mother finally met a kind, loving man and they got married. He happened to be a Brahmin Hindu. Interestingly, he devours Chicken and my mother loves Dosa. On my work front, things were moving at a decent pace. I was selected as Indian delegate to a Workshop in Bangkok, that was my first international trip. I remember this one time when I was walking through a flea-market and all of a sudden this cart full of hanging ducks and pigs came in front of me! I felt gross. That entire trip remained a struggle in terms of food. A fierce non-vegetarian back home, I struggled to find simple chicken to eat as there were all other kinds of animals there I found creepy. That moment, the whole Veg/non-veg debate back home, especially the religious flavour it is given in Gujarat, took a whole new turn in my head. It has nothing to do with religion or right or wrong I realized, it's just habit!

Soon after, the Public Affairs Unit of the American Embassy backed the NGO I was leading. Somewhere down the line they selected me for their International Visitor Leadership Program and sent me for a trip to the US. We were meeting with Senators and people from the UN and US Govt, we met iNGOs and more. Towards the end of the trip, I discovered that the introduction page that had been given to all the guests listed me as a “2002 riot survivor who was working with Muslim Youth on preventing them getting radicalized”. Everyone was nice to me, I was the star! It was ‘positive discrimination’. But that introduction couldn’t be further away from the truth, I was not a ‘riot survivor’, there were people who had lost people and property of their own, I hadn’t. And I wasn’t working with ‘Muslim Youth on preventing them getting radicalized’. I was in fact going to Colleges trying to educate Hindu Youth on communalism and more. I remember telling an American friend: “I don’t think I have been made to feel as Muslim in India as I have in America”. Towards the end of my trip, I remember calling my mother from America one night to tell her: “Mum I’m done, I’m leaving the non-profit world”, “Whatever you feel is best Beta!” she replied.

Moving on, I remember one thing an ex of mine used to tell me: “Tu Muslim nahi hai! Please! Maine keh diya bas!”. It made her more comfortable to think of me that way. Romantic relationships have started for me only after lengthy discussions on my religion, some didn't start at all because of the same and I am also aware that further intense struggles await me. I have also often been told “…par tu waisa nahi hai” after a barrage of insults about Muslims. I remember a friend of my girlfriend’s asking her during the planning of an outstation trip: “Yaar, can we go with a Muslim!”. I also remember that time when I was at an event in a College when students are supposed to be dressed by themes. I was wearing a turquoise Kurta and blue Jeans and this one student came up to me and asked: ""Tumhare group ki theme Al-Qaeda hai kya? Kurta pehena hai!!!"". To this day, I feel uncomfortable wearing a Kurta!

By this time in my life, I knew I was an atheist. Fiercely and irrevocably an atheist. I remember being on a trekking camp in Manali when some co-travellers asked me “Aap ka kya religion hai bhaiya?”, I said “Guess”. They tried everything from Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist, even 'Indian' and 'Human' but they couldn’t guess ‘Atheist’. I let it remain that way. I distinctly remember what one of them did when we returned to Ahmedabad. We got off the bus and were waiting for parents to come and pick everyone up. A boy kept nagging me: “Bhaiya, bolo na, kya religion hai aap ka?”, I kept playing around, avoiding. Soon after, his dad arrived. As he sat behind his father on his scooter and the scooter sped away, the boy turned around and screamed one last time: “BHAIYAAAA BOLO NAA KYA ANSWER HAIIII?????”.

Over the years, people in my family married Hindus, Christians, even a Dalit. I remember wearing a Sikh kada on my wrist out of some fascination I had once. I have kept a tiny Buddha statue in my pocket at times. There are idols of Hindu gods in my home that were gifted to me, there are gorgeous Madhubani artworks of Hindu lords we have, there is also a stunningly beautiful Janamaz (on which Muslims offer Namaz) in my home. I have been to many more temples in my life than to mosques, simply by not saying 'No' each time I've been on a tourist visit to a new place. Have accompanied people to temples and mosques when they asked me to, they would feel good they said and I didn’t mind!

Later, I started-up in 2012. I was the only founder out of the 3 co-founders who couldn't have his name on the office lease agreement, we wouldn’t have been allowed to get that place if I did. To this day, a lot of my Hindu friends in Ahmedabad have no clue about this long-lasting, cemented phenomenon and their shock never ceases to amaze me. Most 20 odd year olds today in at least Ahmedabad have hardly ever interacted with Muslims, because after 1992 and then 2002, most of the ghettoization is complete. Muslims escaped or were forced to leave to live only with Muslims and Hindus moved out to live only with Hindus. Pull up a map of Ahmedabad and I can show you exactly who lives where and there won't be more than a few countable exceptions. And not just Ahmedabad, my cousin in Bombay was made a product for TV debates on the one hand and right-wing trolling on the other when she expressed how it's been tough for her to get a home because of her religion. 

I also remember the time when one of my co-founders was warned by friends: “Be careful, you are about to get into business with a Miyabhai”.
After 9/11, plus lots of global terror attacks over the years and now Trump, I am sometimes told by friends ""Hey you have sometimes wanted to move to Silicon Valley, right? Do you think you will be allowed to now?"". Have had several debates with Muslim acquaintances online and offline about how killing innocents in the name of religion is plainly wrong and is also harming Islam itself! 'Islam isn't flawed, some of its practitioners are' has been a common answer. On a political note, ""Congress or BJP?"" has often been a question put up to me with a visible expectation of me saying the former. To this, a line I read somewhere on Facebook sums it up best: ""Main Musalman hu. Main marna nahi chahta. Is liye filhaal main corruption se kaam chala lunga"". 

After 2002, the Gaurav Yatras and more, a lot more got thrown my way but now it is made to seem as if it never happened. I remember this conversation a Gujarati Hindu gentleman was having with a curious non-Gujarati traveller in a train compartment I was sharing back in 2003. ""It was necessary to teach a lesson to these Muslims. They used to kill our Cows, they used to convert our daughters but now they are scared. Haan yeh aurato aur bachho ke saath thoda zyada ho gaya par overall theek hi hua."" When the other gentleman seemed to disagree and then went to the washroom, this guy told the others: ""Lagta hai Muslim hai!"".

Somewhere around last year, the Triple Talaq struggle my mother and her courageous colleagues were fighting for over 10 years picked up steam. Their interactions with tens of thousands of Muslim women across the Country had convinced them of the damage being propagated to women in the name of religion. That even the Quran - the holy book they all consider themselves reverent to, had no mention of Triple Talaq added further fervour to the fight. 

In response, hundreds of Muslim men, even some women would attack my mother and her colleagues at events, meetings, on TV debates. WhatsApp messages were broadcasted by the thousands about not just her but about her ""atheist son and Hindu husband"". Somewhere along the way Prime Minister Modi and the ruling BJP climbed onto the Triple Talaq bandwagon. Now those Muslims who felt threatened by my mother and her colleagues got a new weapon to target her with: “RSS Agent”. Life took a full turn, made a complete circle! And all of a sudden the same people we felt threatened by all our lives were being accused of being her friends and backers. Soon the political sloganeering and posturing died down but her struggle, their struggle continues and will keep doing so. Before writing this post, I called her to ask: ""Mumma, if I write a post about my relationship with religion, can it harm you or your work?"". ""Your thoughts are your own and they should absolutely be shared, fiercely and openly, don't you ever worry"" she replied instantaneously. The day I decided to drop my father's secular-sounding surname and use my mother's first name as my last name, I knew my identity shall become a lot more visible but it is too small a price to pay for the respect I want to give to her.

My latest tryst with religion was when I went to the #NotInMyName protest at Jantar Mantar just a few days back with my new employers/friends. Several innocent people had been lynched in the name of religion, this time the reason used was ‘Beef’. And then just a few days later, the terrorist attacks on innocent Hindu pilgrims on their way to Amarnath occurred and I remember the same old, familiar feeling coming back yet again!

Who am I fighting, who do I hate, they’re all the same regardless of their name or appearance, who is mine and who is the other, what is the solution, is there even one, is one religion the problem, are all religions the problem, is religion itself the problem, if religion didn’t exist wouldn’t the perpetrators just create something else to use!

Who do I belong to, do I belong to anyone, Who am I? But interestingly, the answer to these questions have been the clearest out of all the above. The others absolutely evade me.

Most of my good friends today are atheist or irreligious, most of them are scarred, most of them have stories of their own. I remain an observer to religion and this is an account of what all it has done to me so far! Let’s see what more you have to offer, dear Religion!

Text from the release,

**Cabinet grants ‘in-principle’ approval to the LIGO-India mega science proposal** 

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ‘in principle’ approval to the LIGO-India mega science proposal for research on gravitational waves. The proposal, known as LIGO-India project (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory in India) is piloted by Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Science and Technology (DST). The approval coincides with the historic detection of gravitational waves a few days ago that opened up of a new window on the universe to unravel some of its greatest mysteries. 

The LIGO-India project will establish a state-of-the-art gravitational wave observatory in India in collaboration with the LIGO Laboratory in the U.S. run by Caltech and MIT. 

The project will bring unprecedented opportunities for scientists and engineers to dig deeper into the realm of gravitational wave and take global leadership in this new astronomical frontier. 

LIGO-India will also bring considerable opportunities in cutting edge technology for the Indian industry which will be engaged in the construction of eight kilometre long beam tube at ultra-high vacuum on a levelled terrain. 

The project will motivate Indian students and young scientists to explore newer frontiers of knowledge, and will add further impetus to scientific research in the country.

PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,42,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,1461362094.0,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

Arun. P.V. who hails from from Manimala in Kerala, got an invitation from the American space research center NASA to work as scientist there. He had completed his M.Tech from Bhopal NIT and after a stint at the renowned Bhabha Atomic Research Center, he completed a PhD at the Masachussetts Institute of Technology. While at the MIT, NASA Extended the invitation. Arun joined work on a fixed term contract.His exceptional caliber and genius led to an offer of a permanent position at NASA.

All other candidates who were invited by NASA for a permanent position, accepted US Citizenship, and joined NASA. However, Arun was adamant that he would not give up his Indian Citizenship for the job. His stand was that if that was the condition, he was more than willing to forego the offer from NASA. He informed NASA that he was willing to quit and return to India if his condition was not acceptable by NASA.

NASA and the US Government must have been very impressed by his patriotism as well as his scientific caliber from what happened afterwards. Arun, a very junior scientist, was included in a high level science and technology co-operation delegation from the US to India that arrived two weeks ago. It was renowned computer scientist Dr. Barbara Liskov, who was also on the delegation, who informed Home minister Rajnath Singh about the courageously patriotic stand that Arun had taken.

Rajnath Singh updated PM Narendra Modi about this, and the PM invited Arun to his official residence for a half hour chat. He told Arun that the doors to the Indian Space research programme will forever be open to him.

If not, can we close these institutes and these departments and just put the tax-payer money into *real science*. You know, things like ISRO, TIFR and IISc where scientists do some actual work.

[Political] Feasibility study of the Indian Bullet Train,1,7bm8zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7bm8zc/political_feasibility_study_of_the_indian_bullet/,1,1510185854.0,"The article displays the cost and a few facts in the start.

Here are the observations and conclusion of the report.

Observations of the Study:-

The study from the financial angle reveals the following
facts (Tangible benefits)
1. In order to recover the cost of interest burden and the
principal amount, the train fare has to be hiked which
could be brought near to the air fare
2. This gives an impression that the current pricing cannot
recover the cost that is involved for investment
3. That means the passenger fare is to be hiked for balancing
the equation
4. This in turn would not help a common man.
5. Therefore tangible benefits are on the negative
6. The Political issue as regards the change of the
Government in every five years and support from
other political parties is also a major issue.

The intangible benefits could be
1. The above cost also involves transfer of technology that
can help the skill development of the working class
2. This can boost the employment under Make in India
Campaign
3. The depleting agricultural employment could be rejuvenated
by generating additional skills as a substitute
for raising the standard of living of the poor people of
India.
4. Real estate prices could be stabilized due to speedy
travel and sufficient balance in economy could be
maintained due to options for people to stay in villages
far off from their work places.
5. Over a period of time Indians may become habitual
to bear the cost of a bullet train, which could become
affordable consequently
6. Mutual international business with Japan could give
immense learning in many aspects such as education,
science and technology from the host country as
a path breaking effort for the future development of
India and Indian people.
7. The intangible benefits appear to be on the positive side
but at what cost??

Significance of the Study:-
Thus the significance of the study can be seen that when
the country is mired with other pressing problems, the
above proposal cannot be at the top of the list. However
the bringing of bullet train is certainly helpful in the long
run for India to be in the top list of elite class.
The other factors such as the Union Minister’s current
plans of additional investments along with the bullet train
cost draws to an inference that there are two economies
i.e. one for the poor class and other for the rich class.
This means that the present investment cannot be
scrapped for want of bullet trains. So the bullet train will
run with a different set of infrastructure along with the
old trains running on different platforms.

Conclusion:

Thus conclusively it is observed that the bullet train is a
substitute travel as a replacement for airways. However
considering the economy of time and money the air travel
is much convenient to the present bullet train.
Interestingly the earlier plan of including Pune and
Mumbai fast track was subsequently dropped, which
could be a step that is debatable as most people who travel
from Pune to Mumbai daily for employment may not get
the opportunity to reach home early

"[R] Why are so many Indians, especially those living in Western nations - so caught up with their Indian identity and pride for the same ?",0,4dyes5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4dyes5/r_why_are_so_many_indians_especially_those_living/,35,1460178318.0,"I am a firm believer in the view that ethnic and religious nationalism is the starting point in many a conflict in the world. I have seen what happens in the muslim world, in the middle ages with christianity and now I am seeing it happen in India.

Identity based pride and ethno-religious nationalism are the bane of modern society.

What is even more baffling to me is people who left India for greener pastures who still cling on to their sense of identity. Leaving aside the handful of those who are selfish dollar-chasing individuals going their only for the money, surely the secular humanist values of the West and the state of their society itself is an attraction ? Or am I mistaken ?

So my question is thus : In India many components of what makes up society, culture, religion, politics and the very system have just rotted away. When the roots themselves are in this sorry state, why try to cling on to them so desperately ?

Should you not want to move away from the homeland and try to adjust with the society that you now live in ?

Lot of NRI fans of Modi and BJP I find very surprising. BJP is a right leaning party, and that means you are proud of your heritage and want to keep the social order intact. Given that there are so many problems in India how on earth can people who moved out of the country hold on to such views ?

To give a few examples to clarify what i mean - so many problems in India : corruption, bad politicians, dirty filthy public places, spitting on the road, rape, casteism, caste murder, hatred towards women. So many problems with religion also - muslims in India are v.v.backward, hindus are also backward in different ways. Same can be said of other religions too. Maybe that is at the root of why India is in such a mess.
So if you are a conservative, must you not be either :

a) in a state of denial about the problems of India or

b) proud of India good along with bad

Conservatives want to keep the same social order and not change it - so that means they are happy with what currently is in place in India.


I have less sympathy for Indian conservatives because unlike American conservatives they have much less to be proud of. Americans have built one of the greatest nations on earth, and have contributed much to humanity in the realm of sciences and technology. India has contributed some stuffs in the ancient era, but now ? it is just quagmire of casteism, corruption, inequality, poverty and misogyny. How can you be proud of that ?


If you want to hold on to your roots with such vigor how do you resolve this dillemma ? How can you condone the numerous issues in your homeland, and then say that you are proud ? I do not understand.

On this big Indian subreddit (/r/india) I can see people routinely criticizing their homeland, and pride is often talked down. But here the NRI population seems all too happy to be proud about India, why is that ?

If you are not aware there are other subreddits that have India pride sentiments but they are mostly rejects and extremists. On twitter there is now an all out war between those who are proud of india and those who distance themselves from all this and are open to discussing the problems India faces. There is a subreddit for NRIs called ABCDesi but they too are averse to even discussing this topic.

TLDR: Identity politics is what leads to vote banks, and taken to extreme fascistic nationalism. Why do so many Indians both in India and without still hold on to this way of thinking ?

TLDR2: Why do Indians living outside India love the BJP brand of politics, and Modi, to this level ?",4
ISRO Mars Mission reaching its final stages. Here is a template comment to shut whiners up.,119,2fiz4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2fiz4s/isro_mars_mission_reaching_its_final_stages_here/,16,1409923750.0,"Thanks to /u/0w0 for the comment in of the threads.
http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1pxxvk/india_has_successfully_launched_a_spacecraft_to/cd76y7g

Before whining starts about the wisdom of spending money on space research/exploration while there are other issues facing India:

1) [ISRO's(Indian Space Research Organization) budget is only **0.34** per cent of Central Government expenditure currently and 0.08 per cent of the GDP(~USD 800 Million).](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/winning-is-a-matter-of-belief-isro-chief/article3875930.ece) Compare that to billions spent on ""Fix Poverty"" programs such as Employment Guarantee Programs([NREGA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi_National_Rural_Employment_Guarantee_Act), USD 7.24+ Billion spent each year) and Subsidized/Free Food Program([FSB,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Food_Security_Bill,_2013)USD 20+ Billion to be spent each year) etc.

2) [And Mars Orbiter Mission/Mangalyaan would cost USD ~**27** Million only.](http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/isro-plans-to-push-more-satellites-this-year/article4469711.ece)

3) ISRO is actually funding itself thanks to annual revenue from foreign satellite launches and sale of satellite data/imagery(that is useful for things like Google Maps for example) through its Antrix Subsidiary. Last time I checked it was **INR 9 BILLION**. [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antrix_Corporation).

4) Data generated by ISRO and related organizations is helping the poorest of poor in India:

>Voluminous data from the Indian remote sensing satellites has benefited millions of farmers and fishermen in achieving higher productivity and making optimal utilisation of resources, a senior space scientist said Saturday.

>""Studies by the premier economic research institute NCAER have shown that remote sensing data has accrued multiple benefits to farmers across the country **with seven percent increase in productivity and helping the farm sector to contribute about Rs.50,000 crore to the national gross domestic product (GDP) over the years**,"" Indian Society of Remote Sensing president V.K. Dadhwal told reporters here.

>Similarly, **application of remote sensing data by the fishing community contributed about Rs.24,000 crore to the GDP and saved fuel consumption by 30 percent** with timely advisories on weather, sea conditions and identification of potential fishing zones for maximizing the catch.  [source](http://zeenews.india.com/news/science/remote-sensing-data-benefits-indian-farmers-fishermen_835856.html)

5) And it is saving lot of lives:

>India was hit hard by Cyclone Phailin, with 12 million people impacted, including millions evacuated from the Odisha coast to safety earlier this week. This was the strongest storm to hit the state in 14 years, and it devastated homes and villages in both Orissa and Andhra Pradesh states, with flooding that has closed roads and left some 100,000 people stranded.[..]

>**The country's satellite imagery satellites are being credited with saving lives thanks to better forecasting, and the ability to share intensity with citizens and policymakers to urge evacuation.** [..]

>There are 11 Indian remote sensing satellites in service, allowing the National Remote Sensing Centre in Hyderabad to help agencies **forecast cyclones more than 72 hours in advance.** [..]

>The **synthetic aperture radar satellites, Risat-1 launched in April last year and Risat-2 which has been in orbit since April 2009 have the ability to look for impending cyclones even at night and through clouds**. The synthetic aperture radar in the satellites enables applications in agriculture too, especially for paddy monitoring during kharif season. Saral, an Indio-French satellite launched on February 25, 2013, can study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation.

>**""Those who criticise the expenditure on space science don't realise its contribution to not just saving lives but alleviating poverty,""** says Bhargava, who founded the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad. ""You can argue that the space department gets higher allocation, but it is well justified. After all, Indian space scientist makes satellites and rockets at a fraction of the cost of similar US projects."" [source1](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-10-13/india/42992231_1_satellites-cyclones-isro) [source2](http://www.asmmag.com/2012-12-30-14-40-18/feature/5908-india-credits-satellite-sentinels-for-saving-lives.html)

[R] Write-up by my friend - Why does modern Indian Society have so little fascination and curiosity about science while retaining its obsession with religion?,10,2gy55w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2gy55w/r_writeup_by_my_friend_why_does_modern_indian/,53,1411247106.0,"Despite tremendous technological progress India has made since independence, most people do not bother to have any appreciation or understanding of the role of science and technology in day to day life. Rather, they retain their age old obsession with religion, rituals and superstition even while being completely surrounded by the products of science . 

Science is seen merely as subjects to study in order to get a job. Few people after leaving the formal education system maintain an interest in science. Few people can give a satisfactory reply ( in simple words ) to questions like 'how electricity is generated?', 'how steel is made?', 'how a car/vehicle works?'

The education system is partly to blame. While Indian science education does a good job in building up a rigorous theoretical foundation of subjects like physics and chemistry, very little attention is paid to making the student appreciate the enormous practical application of science in everyday life and the 'real' world. (the British science education system is much better in this regard, judging from the content of their science books) . 

But society too is to blame - humanity in general and Indians in particular remain obsessed about 'primitive urges' of life - coupling, breeding, earning lots of money and then splurging on expensive items they don't really need. Past decade has seen the emergence of 'mall culture' in India - an over-consumerist, over-materialist, money minded society, where acquisition of more and more material possessions is seen as the *only* route to happiness. Most people think that the purpose of life is to 'mate' , 'breed' and 'consume'. 

But far more despicable than the over-consumerist 'mall culture' is the continued prevalence of religion, archaic customs and traditions and superstitions. Despite the tremendous scientific and technological progress of humanity in the previous two centuries, humans remain wedded to ancient superstitions called religions. Science may have changed human lives beyond recognition, but scientific temper is yet to become commonplace among educated people - most people continue to strongly believe in age old customs and superstitions - belief in supernatural creator and deities, food taboos inspired by religion, and archaic social customs and rituals, like dowry, astrology and caste and sectarian feelings. Nowhere is this more evident than in the great obsession of Indian society - weddings. All kinds of archaic and irrational social customs are still observed in the age of science: the wedding dates are fixed by astrologers, mate selection is done on caste and sect consideration rather than more rational and sensible criteria, the wedding function involves elaborate religious rituals, and finally, the old age social evil of dowry is still prevalent. 

Today human society has reached a odd stage that if an adult watches popular science programs (on Discovery, BBC, National Geographic etc) on topics like electricity, evolution, genetics etc,  one is seen as 'childish' - curiosity and fascination about the natural world is seen as a 'childish' trait not fit for adults - but knowledge about religious rituals, customs and traditions is seen as a hallmark of 'maturity' expected from adults. If an adult questions or criticizes irrational religious beliefs such as astrology, deity worship or rituals, one is seen as 'immature' and 'childish'. 

The Indian constitution has declared that its a 'fundamental duty' of every citizen to build and maintain a 'scientific temper'. Yet, it's amply clear that this has simply not happened. Instead, people retain their old obsession about religious rituals and customs, even while finding it impossible to lead a life without being aided by the gadgets and amenities provided by science. This, is the real irony of present day human society, whether in India or even in most Western countries. People are getting more and more dependent upon the products of science and technology, yet displaying little eagerness to acquire knowledge, understanding and appreciation of science. ",4

- In its report submitted by DB Shekatkar Committee, made recommendations to enhance the combat potential of the all the 3 sections of the Indian Armed Forces. MoD has agreed to implement 90 of the approx. 200 recommendations made.
- Some of them are
    - (1) create Chief of Defense Staff (CDS) post,
    - (2) restructure higher defense structures,
    - (3) move out non‐core areas like, NCC,
    - (4) remove duplicity amongst the 3 areas,
    - (5) conduct project audits at DRDO, OFB and make them accountable.

- These recommendations to be implemented in 2 years time period would translate to yearly savings of ~Rs 250bn.
- In order to boost the ‘Make in India’ PM is expected to soon announce the creation of CDS post and Strategic policy.
- Also IA has got Defense Ministry approval to cut down the number of Sahayaks or ‘buddies’ by 25% (indicating cut down of 10,000 Sahayaks of the total 40,000). This move comes after controversy erupted over the tasks IA Sahayaks perform for officers and junior commissioned officers. IA intends to replace these Sahayaks with civilians, who would be employed for officers in static formations such as the Army Headquarters, units in Delhi and not operational locations like battalions, brigades and division and corps headquarters.

- Implementation of such above‐mentioned initiatives could create room for ~Rs 250bn of yearly savings.
- Money saved could be used towards the deployment of funds towards modernization and upgradation of Indian Defense Fleet. We won’t be surprised if allocation towards the Defense budget gets increased to over 2.0% levels in the next budget.
  
  
**Ajit Doval’s U.S. visit to further strengthen India‐US ties**  
  

- National Security Adviser Ajit Doval visited USA second time after Trump came to power this week, where he met US Defense Secretary‐ Gen (Retd) James Mattis, Secretary of Homeland Security Gen (Retd.)‐ John Kelly and National Security Adviser‐ Lt. Gen. H R McMaster.
- Amongst the key areas discussed include, deepening of the counter‐terrorism co‐operation with India and maritime security.
- He also met Chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee‐ John McCain and Chairman of the powerful Senate Select Committee on Intelligence‐ Senator Richard Burr.
- Outcome of these meetings was a pledge to make a strong defense partnership between both the nations.
- Further, 2 of the Senators Mark Warner from Virginia and John Cornyn from Texas (Co‐chairs of the Senate India Caucus) have written joint‐letter to US Defense Secretary to push for the sale of F‐16 Fighter Jets. India has freezed upon 2 alternatives, Lockheed Martin’s F‐16 and Saab’s Gripen Fighter Jets.
  
**Roadblocks on the Indo‐Russian projects**  

- Last week, Russia signed 2 Long‐Term Service Agreements (LTSA) for spares delivery to India and allows HAL manufacture parts for 230 Su‐30MKI Fighter jets.
- As per this $ 300mn agreement, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and United Engine Corporation (UEC) will render technical support; provide maintenance services and spares to fleet for next 5 years.
- UAC also signed agreement with HAL to provide lifecycle support and maintenance for Mi‐17 helicopters,
- MiG‐29K fighter jet, T‐90 tanks and INS Vikramaditya Aircraft Carrier.
- One more agreement yet to take of is the supply of 60 Multi‐purpose Kazan Helicopters under Phase‐I, where the joint facilities would be set‐up in India to manufacture 140 helicopters.
- In order to expand Su‐30MKI fighter jets combat capabilities, Russia has offered to modernize the fleet by integrating new weapons and upgrading existing weapons and on‐board systems.
- A proposal worth $ 7‐8bn to upgrade the first batch of 80 Su‐30MKI fighter jets to ‘Super Sukhoi’s, would upgrade the plane to a 5th generation Aircraft. This development comes after UAC offered to upgrade the currently used AL‐31FP engines with its AL‐41F‐1S.
  
IDF View:  

- **HAL is making Su‐30MKI fighter jets under license from Russia since 2004. HAL is responsible for after‐sales support, snag disposition, on‐site repair, modification, and upgrade of Su‐30MKI fleet.**
- **This fleet is expensive and faces problems owing to high, premature failure rate of subsystems like engines, radars, missiles, avionics, etc. In 2014, the serviceability rates of Su‐ 30MKI fighter jets were at 46%.**
- **However, post setting‐up the Rs 4 bn after sales service centre for both, Su‐30MKI fighter jets & Helicopters, serviceability has increased to 60% (of the 230 Su‐30MKI fighter jets, 138 are ready for missions at a given time).**
- **MoD intends to take the serviceability levels to ~75%. The concern here is rapidity of repairs of line‐replaceable units and shop‐repairable units.**
- **Russians are reluctant to repair parts (costs ~25% of new items), instead push for supply of spares. As a result, attainment of MoD’s target of 75% serviceability levels would not be an easy cake walk.**
- The proposed JV (Rostec Corp.‐49.5% and HAL‐ 50.5%) to manufacture Kazan Ka‐226T is as per an inter‐governmental agreement signed in Dec‐2015. This agreement assures localization of production and supply of 200 Light Multi‐role Ka‐226T over 9 year’s period. First 60 helicopters would be produced in Russia, while the remaining 140 helicopters will be produced in India. Currently price negotiations are going‐on.
- **Russian Defense manufacturing is 100% government‐owned. For all spare supplies and above mentioned JV, Russia is okay with the involvement of DPSU’s only. In the back‐drop of increased thrust towards private sector participation, Russia has raised its concern about the technology transfer agreement to Indian players.**
- **We do not see Russia ceding to its demands on this matter. This matter is likely to be taken‐up at ministerial level discussion of both the countries.**
- Till the time more clarity emerges on this point, we could see delays in MoD attaining its serviceability targets, procurement of Multi‐role Ka‐226T and other platforms.
- IAF officials have raised their concerns over the engine upgradation, on account of AL‐31’s perceived shortcomings. As a result, Russians have proposed a new fleet upgradation proposal.
- We are of view that the current money on the table could be deployed for other IAF upgradation programmes, hence, any deal materialization on this front could take at some time.
  
  
**India steps‐up efforts to supply Military Equipments to Myanmar**  

- In order to counter China’s position in Asian sub‐continent, India is targeting $2 bn of yearly exports over the next few years. Accordingly, MoD is steadily cranking up ties with Myanmar Defense.
- On Mar‐24, MoD announced that it has got a $37.9 mn (~Rs 2.6 bn) order to supply lightweight torpedo, a naval weapon system with an explosive warhead.
- The technology for this Lightweight Torpedo is developed by DRDO and the system will be manufactured by Bharat Dynamics and L&T.
- This is a follow‐up to the earlier order of Rs 1.8bn to supply Naval Sonars, Acoustic domes and directing gear to Myanmar.

**Malaysian PM on 5‐day visit to India**  

- Malaysian PM Mohd. Najib Tun Abdul Razak is on a 5‐day (Mar‐30 to Apr‐4) official visit to India.
- On his third visit to India, both the sides are expected to discuss areas like, Trade and Investment, Infrastructure Projects, Defense Co‐operation, Air services arrangements, Tourism and Culture Relations as well as issues of mutual concern on regional and International Cooperation.
- Malaysian PM Najib is accompanied by a large team of delegates consisting representatives of top Malaysian companies. Many government‐to‐government Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) and contracts worth $ 5bn are likely to be signed and exchanged during this visit.
  
IDF View:  

- Any Defense agreements signed between the 2 countries would be looked upon positively, as it would be towards the attainment of the $2bn of Defense export target set by the ex‐Defense Minister Mr. Manohar Parrikar.
- Malaysia has already invested $6 bn in India and another $ 6 bn worth of projects are under execution in India. Also, it has bid for many of the Road projects worth $1.2 to $1.4 bn in Rajasthan itself.

**Industry Developments:**
  
**New Defense export strategy to be announced**  
  

- Currently, all exports (including defense exports) from India are covered under Export & Import (EXIM) Policy, which is formulated, issued and executed by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT).
- MoD is currently formulating a separate Defense Export Strategy to give fillip to the defense exports. This new policy framework would include areas like,
    - (1) creation of Export Promotion Body, engaging Indian Missions/ Embassies abroad in export promotion,
    - (2) export financing through Line of Credit,
    - (3) better use of Offset policy,
    - (4) export of indigenously developed Defense systems,
    - (5) streamlining of the export regulation processes.

  
**3‐pronged strategy to ramp‐up Tejas production**  
  

- In order to scale‐up capacity and meet requirements, a 3‐pronged strategy is being pursued by HAL.
- **The first strategy is to outsource ‘Fuselage (body) and Wing’ production work to 3 private players with 2 years delivery period.**
- **Second strategy is to ramp‐up the production plan to 16 LCA’s/ year, and**
- **third one is to turn HAL in to an integrator.**
- CCS has cleared HAL’s proposal worth Rs 13bn in Feb‐2017 to set‐up the 3rd Assembly line covering 30,000 sq.m. at Nekkaundi, Bangalore.
  

IDF View:
- **IAF currently operates 33 squadrons (16‐18 planes each) against the official requirement of 42 squadrons to effectively fight a simultaneous 2‐front war with Pakistan and China. This requirement indicates the dire need to scale up the operations of Tejas. Currently, HAL has the capacity to make 8 Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) ‘Tejas’, which it intends to scale it to 16 by 2018.**
- **In order to ramp‐up the production of Tejas, we view the proposed 3‐pronged growth strategy to be in the right direction.**
- **The first strategy is to outsource the ‘Fuselage (body) and Wing’ production work to 3 private players with 2 years delivery period. Already HAL is pursuing outsourcing model for LCA, with wings being outsourced to L&T (at Coimbatore), Central fuselage to VEM Technologies (at Hyderabad), Rear fuselage to Alpha Tocol (at Bengaluru), precision mechanical assemblies to Alpha Tocol and Brahmos Aerospace (at Thiruvananthapuram).**
- **In HAL management’s opinion, contribution from outsourcing works should increase from the current 39% to 61% going forward.**
- **The third proposal is to position HAL as the lead integrator for this project. With all the facilities in place, and delivery of Fuselage (body) and Wing’ to be supplied by private players, HAL’s could focus on ramping‐up the operations.**
- **Also, HAL has already signed long‐term supply contract with vendors and availability of all the parts for the platforms manufactured by them is now gone up to &gt;65%.**
- **On a whole, this 3‐pronged strategy, should help HAL scale the production to 16 LCA’s/year in ****2018.**
  
**IN gets 3 Naval Systems from DRDO**  

- DRDO handed over 3 Naval Systems, USHUS‐II submarine sonar, directing gear for hullmounted sonar array, and Inertial navigation system for ship applications (INS‐SA) to IN on Mar‐24.
- Defense Minister also released 2 products developed by DRDO, IP‐based secure phone and the Gallium Nitride Technology.
- IP‐based secure phone incorporates an indigenous encryption algorithm on ""trustworthy hardware platform"" to provide high level of secrecy to voice & data for communication of strategic and tactical plans of Armed Forces.
- **Gallium Nitride Technology will help in the development of nexgen Radars, Seekers and Communication systems, which would find application in Light Combat Aircrafts.**
  
IDF View:  

- This is a positive development as all the 5 products mentioned above have been imported to date.
- USHUS‐II is a package of several sonars, which includes passive sonar, active sonar, intercept sonar, obstacle avoidance sonar and underwater telephony.
- All the 5 products, once installed would significantly enhance the navigation systems and the communication networks of the Carriers/ Submarines.
- MoD earlier indicated that 5 kilo class submarines, billed as IN’s underwater workhorses, will have state of the art USHUS‐II sonar suites. There is a proposal to fit these Sonars with Arihant class Submarines.
  
**INS Vikramaditya successfully test fires Barak Missile**  
  

- INS Vikramaditya, a floating Airfield carrier with length of 284 m and maximum beam of 60 m can carry 30+ Aircrafts, comprising MiG‐29Ks, Kamov‐31s, Kamov‐28s, ALH‐Dhruv & Chetak Helicopters.
- On Mar‐22, IN successfully conducted its maiden trial firing of the newly installed Barak Short range Surface‐to‐Air Missile System (B‐SRSAM) from its Aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya.
- During the trial firing, this missile was fired against live low flying high speed target and the target was successfully engaged and destroyed.
- This Israelis Barak‐2 Missile was taken out from a de‐commissioned warship and fitted into INS Vikramaditya by cutting its deck. The firing was conducted as part of the 'Operational Readiness Inspection' of Western Fleet.
  
IDF View:  

- This 44,500tn Carrier commissioned in Nov‐2013 at Severodvinsk, Russia and was originally scheduled to have Long‐Range Surface‐to‐Air Missile System (LR‐SAM), currently under joint development with Israel.
- Delay in the development have left the carrier with no choice and currently does not have its own Air Defense system.
- As a result, it was forced to rely on support ships in the carrier battle group for any further Air cover.
- With the deployment of SRSAM, we expect INS Vikramaditya to get some boost in its Air Defense Systems.

**Cabinet clears 2 proposals worth $1.85bn**  

- CCS on Mar‐30 cleared 2 Defense proposals worth $ 1.85bn (~Rs 120.25bn).
- The first one is $ 650mn (~Rs 42.25bn) deal for procurement of 100 K9 Vajra‐T tracked 155mm/ 52 caliber Artillery system from L&T for IA.
- The second proposal is a $ 1.2bn (~Rs 78bn) deal to acquire 32 Dhruv Advanced light helicopters (ALH) for IN and ICG.
- RFP for the procurement of 100 K9 Vajra‐T tracked 155mm/ 52 caliber Artillery systems was first floated in Jan‐2011 and 4 bidders including Tata, OFB, BEML and L&T led JV participated in the bid. Thereafter on completion of the evaluation process in Sep‐2016, L&T was informed about ministry’s decision. On completion of the bench marking process, L&T the only qualified bidder was announced as the bid winner. This bid has been invited under ‘Buy Global’ category.
- The second project cleared was to buy the indigenously developed ALH from HAL, where both, IN and ICG would get 16 choppers each. This contract also covers Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for 5 years to 16 Helicopters of the ICG.
- PBL would ensure availability of products to customer and here the responsibility gets transferred to contractor. PBL envisages rewards or penalties based on the performance.
  
IDF View:  

- L&T partnered with Samsung for this 155 mm Artillery Guns. K9 Vajra‐T Gun is a variant of the Samsung Techwin K9 Thunder. These Artillery guns are specially designed for operations in the desert areas.
- This long awaited project getting the Cabinet nod, gives big boost to L&T’s Defense division’s growth prospects for FY2018 and there‐after. Even though this project has been awarded under the ‘Buy Global’ category, the K9 Vajra‐T gun will be made at L&T’s Talegaon plant, Pune.
- First 10 guns would be supplied by L&T to IA within 18 months of signing the contract, and the balance 90 guns would be supplied in next 2 years.
- Clearance to acquire 32 Dhruv Advanced light helicopters (ALH) is a big positive for HAL, as their Order book would grow by ~Rs 78bn.
- HAL is awaiting EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) certification for the civil variant of Dhruv. Once Dhruv gets EASA certification HAL sees huge export potential for Dhruv.
- It has already tied‐up with Israel’s Israel Aircraft Industries to market Dhruv Helicopter worldwide. HAL expects to close a deal with Asian countries like, Myanmar, Indonesia and Sri Lanka where the negotiations are ongoing at various stages.
- On a whole, this announcement is positive for L&T and HAL.
  
**Boeing P8I replaces Tupolev TU142M Maritime Patrol Aircraft**  

- On Mar‐29, Tupolev TU142M, Long Range Maritime Reconnaissance Anti‐Submarine Warfare (LRMR‐ASW) Aircraft was de‐inducted by IN after 29 year of service at INS Rajali, Arakkonam, TN.
- Most of the serving and retired INAS (Indian Naval Air Squadron) 312 officers were present.
- This TU142M Long Range Maritime Patrol aircraft was first inducted into INAS 312 at Dabolim, Goa from erstwhile USSR in 1988. Thereafter, it shifted its base permanently to INS Rajali in 1992.
- This aircraft has distinguished service track record of 30,000+ hours of accident free flying.
- A total of 8 Tupolev TU142M were inducted by IN and only 3 of them were in operations at the time of this de‐induction.
- Boeing’s P‐8I Aircraft post its induction in Nov‐2015 is the replacement for Tupolev TU142M.
- It is already integrated into the operational grid of IN.
  
IDF View:  

- In Jan‐2009 MoD awarded $2.1 bn contract to Boeing for supply of 8 P‐8I (Poseidon Eight India) planes to IN, as a replacement for Tupolev TU142M. Thereafter in mid‐2016, CCS cleared $1 bn repeat contract to procure another 4 of the P‐8I planes.
- Boeing’s P‐8I is armed with Harpoon Block‐II Missiles, MK‐54 Lightweight torpedoes, Rockets and depth charges.
- P‐8I Aircraft is produced by Boeing‐led industry team, comprising CFM International (Engines), Northrop Grumman (Directional Infra‐red Counter‐measures & Electronic Support measures System), Raytheon (Radars), Spirit AeroSystems (Fuselage), BAE Systems and GE Aviation.
- Also P‐8I is integrated with BEL’s Communication systems (IFF Interrogator & Transponder System), Avantel’s Mobile Satellite System, Dynamatic’s Power & Mission Equipment cabinet, Tata’s APU Door fairings and radomes and ECIL’s Speech secrecy System.
- This indicates more work flow possibly for these Indian companies once works on 4 of the P‐8I Aircrafts gains momentum.
- On a whole, we are of view that P‐8I developed by Boeing is world‐class and up to‐date from technology point of view (v/s Tupolev TU142M) and is well equipped to handle IN’s long‐range maritime snooping and Anti‐submarine warfare capabilities.
  
  
**IN inducts INLCU L51 & a new weather monitoring System**  

- IN has successfully commissioned INLCU L51 on Mar‐28, 2017 at Port Blair.
- This surveillance ship is deployed for checking poaching, illegal fishing, drug trafficking and other unlawful activities in the Indian Ocean region.
- This Ship with displacement of 900 tn, 62.8 m in length and 11 m in breadth will be armed with 30 mm CRN ‐91 guns, 12.7 mm Heavy Machine Guns and 7.62 mm Medium Machine Guns.
- Also, state‐of‐the art Electronic Warfare suite is deployed for early detection of adversaries.
- This LCU made by Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Ltd (GRSE) has a lift capacity of up to 216 persons (includes 160 fully equipped soldiers, 56 crew and 145 tn of military equipment.
- Also, it has a Vehicle lift capacity is 1‐ 65 tn tank (like Arjun) or 2‐ 45 tn tanks (like T‐72/80), or 4‐ 13.5 tn BMP Infantry Fighting Vehicles.
- In another development IN on Mar‐28 unveiled Integrated Aviation Meteorological System (IAMS), Rajali Air Station TN to ensure increased accuracy in their Weather Monitoring systems.
- Implementation of IAMS is to modernize the Infrastructure across 9 of the Naval Air Stations (NAS).

IDF View:  

- This is the first LCU Mark‐IV ship commissioned by IN. In Sep‐2011, GRSE awarded Rs 21bn contract to make 8 of such ships.
- All 8 of them have been released by GRSE and are undergoing trials.
- In order to ramp‐up execution, GRSE outsourced major chunk of work to small Shipyards in‐and‐around Kolkata.


**Company Update:**
  
**BEL reports Rs 88bn of provisional turnover during FY2017**  

- In a press release dated April 1, 2017 BEL reported that it has clocked provisional revenues of about Rs 88bn for FY2017, reflecting ~19% yoy increase. Reported provisional revenues are ahead of our estimates of Rs 82.7bn.
- Execution of projects like, Akash Weapon Systems, Handheld Thermal Imager with Laser Range Finder, 3D Tactical Control Radar, Weapon Locating Radar, Upgraded L70 Guns, Fire Control Systems, Hull Mounted Sonar, Radio relays, Elements of Integrated Air Command and Control Systems, Ship borne Electronic Warfare Systems in our view contributed to such strong top‐line numbers for FY2017.
- On the back of such strong execution, we expect the company to report better than expected EPS estimate of Rs 63.9/share for FY2017.
- Strong bid pipeline, coupled with their strong market positioning, should help BEL report strong financial performance, going forward. We continue to maintain BUY rating on the stock with price target of Rs 192/share.
  
**BDL and L&T sign MoU to export Torpedoes**  

- On Mar‐27 Bharat Dynamics Ltd. (BDL) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with L&T to export Light Weight Torpedoes (LWT‐XP) designed and developed by Naval Science & Technology Laboratory (NSTL).
- Currently, NSTL torpedoes are deployed in the IN Ships.
- BDL is the lead manufacturer of all the indigenously developed Missiles with its production units at Telangana and Andhra.
- With the technology transfer from NSTL, BDL will start manufacturing Torpedoes, going forward.
  
IDF View:  

- This is a positive development as private sector participation continues to increase in the Indian Defense eco‐system.
- India in Mar‐2017 had signed $ 37.9mn contract with Myanmar to supply Lightweight Torpedoes.
- In order to fulfill the requirement for this contract, we expect BDL & L&T to combinedly work and deliver the Torpedoes to Myanmar government.
- L&T in our view offers Torpedo Ladle Cars (TLC) in various capacities (from 175‐400 tn) to meet the transport requirement of hot metals at their Steel plants. L&T designs and manufactures TLC’s at their integrated manufacturing facility in Odisha, which is equipped with advanced features, like, Automated Positioning systems, On‐board Weighing systems, Online tracking systems, etc.
- We expect L&T’s share of this project to be somewhere around Rs 800mn.
  
**Samtel Avionics ties‐up with Hanwha for Military Applications**  
  

- Delhi based Samtel Avionics has formed joint venture with Hanwha Systems, South Korea to manufacture products of avionics and military applications.
- This JV aims to manufacture Military Electronics, Optronics for Guided Missile, Rockets, Guided Missiles and Laser‐Guided Bombs (LGB).

IDF View:  

- Samtel over the years has built capabilities in Airborne Electro‐Optic Systems, Electronic Warfare Systems (EWS), and packages to upgrade Armoured Vehicles (including day and night sights, Fire Control Systems, Ballistic Computer, smart computers with displays).
- Hanwha Systems on the other hand, is a South Korea Defense company specializing in Naval and Air Command, Control, Communication, Computer and Intelligence (C4I), Guided Weapons, Electronic Warfare (EW) and Future Combat Systems.
- This is a second JV for Hanwha Group. Earlier, through Hanwha Techwin it collaborated with L&T to provide Artillery Guns for IA. It is still waiting for this project to be awarded.
- As part of this JV, Hanwha has agreed to the full transfer of technology for 3‐4 platform project opportunities that they are pursuing.
- With 3‐4 JV’s already vying for the same emerging pie, it needs to be seen, which all Joint Ventures would emerge victorious.
- Notably, companies with in‐house capabilities like, BEL would still enjoy edge over other players for next 2‐3 years as they have high indigenization component to offer, which should help them quote competitive pricing.
- Further, smaller Defense companies like, Premier Explosives would see increased competition 2‐3 years down the line, from this JV as Samtel would get access to technology for making Seekers.

""Truth Alone Triumphs""

I am on this sub for more than 2 months and i believe that there is something wrong that actually need to be pointed out. It is healthy to assume that people who lurk here are some of the most intellectual minds of India and constitute a very small percentage of Indian population.

I always find the discussion around here mostly on the politics, religion, India-Pakistan , Bollywood, Cricket, KRK Tweets, Swamy tweets etc. I find that very odd because I believe reddit is very good place where we can discuss some other crucial problems that our country is facing right now and may be find solutions to some of them. The examples could be poverty, malnourishment, public healthcare, public education, Food security, energy security, women's rights, national security, national infrastructure, science & technology etc. 

Poverty, malnourishment, public healthcare, public education, Food security are some issues left almost untouched. Everytime i come to this sub there will be a post about *Hindutva*, BJP, Modi, Secularism, sawmy's tweets, KRK etc. I really want to know more in the science other than just ISRO. I really want to know what the Indian engineers are working on.I would like to know and discuss about the initiatives for reforms in education sector. But why are we not discussing that?

Is it OK for Eugenics in India?,0,1clm1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1clm1f/is_it_ok_for_eugenics_in_india/,33,1366313956.0,"I ask this question since I have recently learned about the studies which point to the very low IQ of the average Indian (a meagrely 80^[1][2][3] ). The failed Eugenics program (Castes) has left the nation in a total mess. The implementation of democracy to such a system further complicated the picture. The over representation of Brahmins in government jobs agencies still continues and will continue as they have had a millennia or two of evolutionary pressure, leading to an advantage in fields such as science and technology. My understanding from the average IQ of the Indian is that the development that is noticeable in India will not get any better when the people that vote have no understanding of the system and are easy to manipulate. 

A person who has many low IQ offspring creates more suffering in the world, firstly to the offspring himself who is unable to fit into the modern society, secondly to the society who must provide for such a person. This fact is compounded by the incompetent democratic system which keeps giving free aid to such lower classes. The most likely solution in India is to follow a meritocratic system with eugenics. Again here too I am afraid people are incapable of grasping the importance of such a concept. It is entirely possible that in the near future there will be increased cases of private eugenics in India. 

I would like to note that I am not of the Brahmin caste, in fact I am from a shudra caste, although not of a backward caste classification. I love my country and the people in it, but I am worried about how we will never be able to get any further with this population (me included). I am willing to give up my reproductive rights for the betterment of the nation, if I am seen unfit.

Is this incorrect way to think? I do not want to hurt people, I do not want to cause more suffering either. There must be a better solution? Anyone have any thoughts? 

Downvote if you think that I have offended you, I am sorry.

Pie[R]cing the MEA's fog on Section 46 of supplier liability for nuclear accidents,2,2vbqhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2vbqhu/piercing_the_meas_fog_on_section_46_of_supplier/,6,1423536172.0,"Piercing the MEA's fog on Section 46 of supplier liability for nuclear accidents

1. The Ministry of External Affairs' FAQs on N-liability for suppliers makes too much of fact that two amendments to include suppliers in the second part of 46 was negatived by the Rajya Sabha.

2. Section 46 says: ""The provisions of this Act shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other law for the time being in force, and nothing contained herein shall exempt the operator from any proceeding which might, apart from this act, be instituted against such operator.""

3. Until now, the Indian government and US suppliers have read this section to mean victims of a nuclear accident continue to have the right to invoke tort claims against any tortfeasor, whether operator or supplier. Now we are being told this is no longer the case.

4. Ironically, the government minister who piloted the law himself made the point about tort law during the RS debate. This is what Prithviraj Chavan, Minister of State in the PMO and for Science and Technology, said in Parliament on August 25, 2010. The implied reference to Sec 46 is unmistakable:

""There was a lot of debate on ceiling. Why has the ceiling been kept at a particular level? As I have informed in the opening remarks, this is a Bill for prompt payment, no fault payment, to likely victims or unfortunate victims. All other laws that are in existence in the country like the criminal liability law, the tort law, the product liability law, etc., are not being touched at all. They are all in place. This is an additionality. If we don’t pass this legislation today, all those laws which are in existence today will remain and the liability of the supplier for negligence, gross negligence, wilful
negligence, etc., will be in place because they are there in the Law of Torts and other criminal law regime. What is being done here is that we are bringing a new regime for quickly compensating the victims.""

5. Here, Chavan has made two important points. First, that the aim of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act is to provide speedy compensation for victims up to a specified ceiling (a goal which is met by channeling no-fault liability on to the operator); and second, that victims who are unhappy with this ceiling may use their rights under tort law to sue for more damages under existing laws, which remain in place, and under which suppliers are liable if they are in any way negligent.

6. Later in the Rajya Sabha debate, Chavan returns to this point:
""The suppliers are a little unhappy. But we will be able to explain to the suppliers that all the existing laws cannot be abridged; some of the constitutional guarantees cannot be abridged; those will remain. We have worked with those laws up till now.""

7. Now, when the government minister, in an implied reference to Section 46, talks about the CLNDA allowing the law of torts to be used against suppliers, how can the MEA cite the voting down of two redundant amendments to claim Parliament explicitly rejected torts against suppliers?

8. The amendments moved by D. Raja and Sitaram Yechury were rightly rejected because the sub-clause where the words ""and suppliers"" was being inserted had no use for them. That sub-clause was clearly intended to reinforce the idea that the channeling of no-fault liability to the operator would not exempt him from other proceedings, especially criminal proceedings.

9. The MEA cites Supreme Court jurisprudence to conclude that ""It is well-settled principle of law that every statute is to be interpreted in accordance with the intention of the legislature or maker of the Statute"" and that the defeated amendments are conclusive proof that suppliers are not covered by Section 46.

10. In the light of the government minister's statements quoted above that the CLNDA is only an additionality and that the existing laws of the land including tort law continue to apply even for suppliers, the same assertion on the interpretation of statute will likely come to haunt the Modi government as it attempts to dilute the liability law through the backdoor.

I feel the title doesn't do justice to how serious this issue really is.

>The Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) cancelled an invitation to scientist Gauhar Raza for a lecture after the institute reportedly discovered that he had made a documentary on the Gujarat riots. Mr. Raza, a chief scientist at the National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources in the Department of Science and Technology, was to address Group A officers of the Indian Information Services at the IIMC on April 8. But a day before the event, the institute withdrew its invitation without offering any reason.

So now, educational institutions are scared of inviting people who've had criticized the Hindutva brigade in the past. This is a scary glimpse into what the future holds. Free speech is being stiffled and this will only get worse. What's worse is, that the event had nothing to do with his documentary. His lecture was cancelled because of a totally unrelated issue.

http://www.sciencemag.org/content/350/6261/617.full

> India's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has boosted the country's economy by fostering a booming generic drug industry and devising new approaches to hybrid crops. Now, the network of 38 national laboratories needs to nurture its own finances. The central government, intent on curbing domestic spending, feels CSIR's $600 million budget is a luxury it can no longer afford and has given the labs 2 to 3 years to “self-finance” half their expenditures by winning grants, licensing discoveries, and collaborating with industry.

> The ultimatum, issued quietly at a CSIR meeting in June, is the most dramatic sign of the funding squeeze now gripping science in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government insists it is not hostile to research: Rather, it wants R&D to better serve national interests. In addition to seeking their own funding, CSIR lab chiefs now must send reports to the government about how their centers serve flagship government programs such as schemes to build smart cities, clean the Ganges River, and promote sanitation. CSIR's newly appointed director general, Girish Sahni, says he is fully on board with the directive. “We don't always depend on our parents, do we?” he asks. “We live in challenging times, and this present government has posted these challenges on the bulletin board of the nation.”

> But the self-financing directive has riled many in India's scientific community. The CSIR labs “were founded to give know-how to Indian industry, and I agree that they should work on solving the country's problems,” says Shri Krishna Joshi, a former CSIR director general. “But I fail to understand how frontier R&D institutions can become self-supporting in 2 years, unless they take on routine jobs like testing, which technicians at third-rate labs usually get subcontracted to do.”

> Since Modi came to power 18 months ago, his government has increased overall spending, by 5.7% this year. But most of the rise went to infrastructure projects—building new highways and upgrading rail lines, for instance—to stimulate economic growth. Meanwhile, it has slashed spending on the environment and social welfare, including health. A study to be published in The Lancet next month warns of a “collapse” if the government continues its low levels of investment in public health, among the lowest in the world at 1.3% of gross domestic product. Most science agencies have barely kept pace with inflation. “I'm already working against all odds on a very low budget,” one medical researcher says. “Everyone I know is pissed beyond belief.”

> In science and technology, the sole winners are the Department of Atomic Energy, which is ramping up construction of nuclear reactors, and the Indian Space Research Organisation. Those champions reflect another Modi priority: indigenous innovation, at which India's nuclear and space communities excel thanks to years of coping with international sanctions imposed over the country's nuclear weapons program. Underscoring that, the government this week launched a $153 million program called IMPRINT to support projects, it said, “in areas where the country is heavily dependent on foreign technology.” Smart sensors, renewable energy, nanotechnology, and diagnostic imaging are priorities.

> Some scientists worry that the Modi government is not getting sound scientific advice. The prime minister disbanded a scientific advisory council that had served his predecessor. As a result, says C.N.R. Rao, a chemist who served as the previous government's chief scientific adviser, the government now lacks “capable people advising them on policy matters.”

> The government's moves put CSIR's very future at stake, some say, because the self-financing drive is doomed to fail. India doesn't have a funding ecosystem like that of the United States, where entrepreneurial scientists can seek venture capital and foundation support, says Sidharth Chopra, who studies antibiotic resistance at the Central Drug Research Institute in Lucknow, a CSIR-affiliated lab. “In India, there's nobody, not a single industrialist, who'll give you a dime,” he says.

> He thinks the government has its priorities wrong. “I'm a big [space] fan, don't get me wrong,” Chopra adds. “But the next time you have diarrhea, and don't have antibiotics that work, Mars will be the last thing on your mind.”

> Defending the CSIR directive, Harsh Vardhan, India's science minister, told The Hindu newspaper last week that the government hopes to hasten technology transfer from lab to industry, and to make labs more accountable. “There is no harm in relying on industry to scale up or take forward the research projects underway,” he said.

> Sahni, CSIR's director, says that researchers should quit griping and get with the program. “It's high time Indian scientists rose to the occasion, and not merely published papers to satisfy their natural curiosity,” he says, “but also got together, with their best ideas and technologies, to solve the nation's problems.”",4

##“It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform.” 

*Article 51-A(h) of the Constitution*

------------
Indian society has been, culturally and historically, steeped in religious dogmas, superstitions and blind beliefs. 

>“[W]e are witnessing a phenomenal growth of superstitious beliefs and obscurantist practices. The influence of a variety of godmen and miracle makers is increasing alarmingly. The modern tools of propaganda and communication [emphasis added] are being used to give an impression that there exist instant and magical solutions for the problems that confront our people. 

**A National Science Survey in 2004 found that for two-thirds of the viewing public, TV was the leading source of scientific information.**

-----------------

##Eclipse and the media
[...]witnessed the tremendous influence of television in propagating and strengthening age-old superstitions about the ill-effects of the eclipse. 

**But the next total eclipse of 1995 saw a significant change in people’s attitude.**

With several institutions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) joining in to create scientific awareness about the eclipse, thousands came out with the sunglasses that were distributed to watch the spectacle despite the fact that **TV channels continued to air antiquated views and blind beliefs about the eclipse.** 

---------------

##Milk-drinking Ganesha
September 1995 saw mass hysteria all over the country around the apparent miracle of “milk-drinking Ganesha”.

Despite public demonstrations by scientists, rationalists and the Ministry of Science and Technology that it was the result of combined action of the surface tension of the fluid and the capillary action of the statue material, people, and indeed TV channels too, paid no heed.

--------------------

##Astrology course

The slain **rationalist Narendra Dabholka**r was himself involved in exposing the dubious claims of Indian astrologers in a controlled experiment.

Professional astrologers were invited to participate in the test and each of the 27 competent astrologers (from all over Maharashtra) who agreed to participate was given 40 random horoscopes from among the 200 and asked to say which of them were of bright kids and which were not. 

The **results of the test were no better than pure chance**. The highest score of correct predictions was only 24 by a single astrologer and 22 by two.

In 1997, the **Indian Science Congress honoured an astrologer with an award**. The University Grants Commission (UGC) in 2001 formally **approved the establishment of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in “Vedic Astrology”** and the allocation of funds to such new departments.

-------------

##Indian Space Research Organisation & Superstitions 
What is more curious is that officials of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), which successfully sent a spacecraft to the moon and intends to send one to Mars next month, **should unfailingly offer prayers** at the Tirupati temple before every launch—these days it is no less than the Chairman himself—and **carefully avoid inauspicious times, such as rahu kaalam, to choose rocket launch windows**.

*Such behaviour on the part of even the elite scientific community only helps entrench blind beliefs and superstitions.*

-----------

##Media

The anti-science tendencies of TV channels have been increasingly evident in the last 10-15 years. The airing of programmes regularly about the doomsday predictions by Nostradamus or unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or aliens landing on the earth by channels such as India TV and IBN7 is on the rise.

One very recent instance was the continuous running of a programme based on the claims of fringe groups in Europe that the starting of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the highest energy particle accelerator at CERN in Geneva, would result in the end of the world.

-----


The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting [...] recently issued two sets of guidelines—restraining TV channels from telecasting **programmes encouraging superstition and blind beliefs**.

[...]The managers of such media invoke the argument of freedom of expression and speech. However [...] these channels also have their constitutional obligation under Article 51-A(h) **to help develop and inculcate scientific temper** in society. 

##The media must play a constructive and responsible role in strengthening the notion of scientific temper in society.

"TIL a US company owned by Princely Family of Liechtenstein tried to patent ""Basmati Rice"". The US Patent Office granted a broad patent in 1997 but it was eventually watered down after India challenged the patent and threatened a WTO dispute.",250,c2ubif,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c2ubif/til_a_us_company_owned_by_princely_family_of/,20,1561054981.0,"Company Rice Tec : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiceTec

> THE FACTS
> 
> * Originally from India and Pakistan, Basmati became a controversial ‘issue’ after RiceTec, a Texas-based company, in 1997, patented some types of rice they developed as “American basmati”.
> * RiceTec Inc, had been trying to enter the international Basmati market with brands like “Kasmati” and “Texmati”. Ultimately, the company claimed to have developed a new strain of aromatic rice by interbreeding basmati with another variety. They sought to call the allegedly- new variety as Texmati or American Basmati.
> * RiceTec Inc, was issued the Patent number 5663484 on Basmati rice lines and grains on September 2, 1997.
> * This was objected to by two Indian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) — Centre for Food Safety, an international NGO that campaigns against biopiracy, and the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, an Indian environmental NGO who filed legal petitions in the United States. The Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research also
> objected to it.
> * They sought trade protection for basmati rice of the Indian subcontinent and jasmine rice of
> Thailand. They demanded amendment of U.S. rice standards to specify that the term “basmati” can be used only for rice grown in India and Pakistan, and jasmine for the Thai rice.
> * The Indian government, after putting together the evidence, officially challenged the patent in June 2000.

I want some career advice but I have no friends in the relevant fields to ask. I graduated in electrical engineering and learnt absolutely nothing and have no skills to get me a job in electrical field. So I turned to IT and worked there for 1 year and god it was shit. I decided I will never get into IT and get into some product based companies. The issue is I have no education in CS. I quit last year and decided to give GATE-2019 in CS/IT paper to make my way into the computer science fields as I feel I am good at coding and stuff. I got AIR of 5300 in the GATE exam and am trying again for next year. (I'll continue with masters in whichever college I get if I don't get a good score this year too).

So now I'm completely clueless as for what my future plans are. Other than attempting GATE and doing masters. What am I supposed to do next? I feel like I don't have any practical skills to make myself employable. I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites. But I doubt that is enough to get me a job. I am thinking of learning some online courses and learn something other than C. But what should I learn? What do I have to learn to make myself employable? I understand that what I should start learning depends on which job I want to get into. But I can't decide and have no one to consult. I hear some buzzwords like data science and machine learning on the news and online but I don't know if that is right for me.

I thought of getting into the following fields: ML, Data science, Web development, Android development.

But again I have not the slightest idea of any of those. As far as I understand, ML and Data science requires more math and I can't say I'm good at math. With web development, I'm afraid it is not like traditional coding and wonder if it has good job opportunities here in India.

If you know any other good field with good opportunities in India please suggest.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I know that I have a goal. Which is to get a good coding related job. But I don't know how to get to that goal. Nor which technology I should get into. So please help me decide.",4

* Still in college (preferably in 1st year)
* Have a zeal to excel in the field and get relevant jobs.
* Have a blank resume with respect to your engineering degree.

**Stage 0 : Pre-work**

If you are very new to college, the odds are you are either severely depressed because of the achievements of people around you or you are overly enthusiastic for a new beginning or you are just unaffected by college. All of those are okay. If you are in the basket where you are scared of people boasting off about their achievement in the first year of college, don't worry! It doesn't matter what others do as long as you do what you can do and a lot of people who boast do not possess the expertise they think they posses. However, if you feel out of place, do DM me. We can have a chat.

In the pre-work phase, one has to understand their college and how things work in their college. This is best done in first year, before your first summer vacation. Most of the colleges have cells or clubs that have some sort of active projects. You need to talk to people, go through the college website and find out about these clubs. These clubs can be student-run or it can be run by a group of professors. You should be looking at the latter as they have well defined problem statements that they'd be working on and you've better chances of getting good exposure working on these projects.

Make a list of all the clubs that are there. Know about the procedure to get into each of these clubs, the projects they are offering / have previously done and who is the contact point. From these clubs, pick any of the interesting clubs/projects and set a goal to work towards developing skills that would help in those projects.

A personal recommendation would be to avoid highly specific clubs i.e. if a club is focusing on one problem statement that it is trying to solve since a few years it might not be the ideal place for a newbie to join. Smaller problem statements are good.

At the end of this stage, you must have a goal to be a part of one (or multiple) clubs during your first summer break.

**Stage 1 : Year 1**

In the first year, you will be under a common branch and your subjects will be science-related and not field-related. You might have 1 subject each semester that relates to your field, but I am not sure how much of help that would be as the teachers would be teaching the subject to non-CS people too. However, they will be introductory programming classes and its good to focus during these classes. If you don't find them helpful, read on.

We will divide the 12 months of first year into 3 quarters. 

1. Spend the first three months into learning at least one programming language. 
2. In your second three months, you should be able to read code and implement a few things. Then, pickup a programming language like C++ / Java. 
3. In your third quarter, you should look at trying to test your learning by implementing something useful. It can be small, it can be something that's already there, but do try to implement it from scratch by yourself.

Let me elaborate all three stages clearly.  


**Stage 1.1 : First Quarter, First Year - Learning a programming language**  
Python is an easy programming language to start off. You can also start off with C/C++/Java if you really want to skip a few steps, but I would ideally suggest you start off with Python. Learning resources like Hackerrank Language course, Automate The Boring Stuff e-book, some long Youtube tutorials and Learn Python The Hard Way ebook should be of help.  
Note : You should not aim to finish all 4 sources as that is not practically possible in three months. Follow a breadth first learning approach where you read a little and write a little. 

A good step to start off would be to aim to get 4 stars on Hackerrank's Python course to get a good grasp of the syntax. You should be familiar with indentation, for loops, if-else ladders, functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries and optionally, list comprehension. During your course, if you feel like something isn't clearly explained in Hackerrank, navigate to that section of Learn Python The Hard Way and refer it.

At this stage, you are comfortable with reading and writing Python, not explore Automate The Boring Stuff and try implementing some of the tasks given there. (I am looking at something that is onwards from chapter 8 of that book).

Alternatively, you can also watch and implement code from hour long Youtube tutorials that make promise to make you a hero from a zero in Python. But this looks like a hack that isn't rewarding because you are quite literally copy-typing the code that the Youtuber has written.

**Stage 1.2 : Second Quarter, First year - Implement & Learn OOP**

Many companies in the outside market look for Object Oriented Programming as a skill. After writing Python code, you are probably going to curse Java/C++ and will skip it completely because you won't believe how relevant these languages are in the market. This is one of the most common mistakes people do, but at the end they'd have to end up learning at least one of these languages. If you are taking up Java, I'd recommend [Derek Banas' Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19) on youtube. You'd be coding what he's coding, but if you understand your code that is good enough. Learn about data structures in java (List, Set, etc) and learn about Iterators, Object Oriented Design Principles (Inheritance, Interface, Extension, etc). If you are looking for something smaller, [try this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/). 

Similar courses exist for C++ also, so do your homework.

**Stage 1.3 : Third Quarter, First Year - Build something small**

So, now you know Python and to some extent Java. You've two paths from here. One is build something using Python/Java or second, learn HTML + CSS + JavaScript and build something with that. It can be something as small as a script receiving some data from an API and putting it in an excel sheet, or a calculator. The idea of this experiment is to check how fast you can build things. Once it is suitably built, you will have to write test cases. If you think it is too early to write test cases, list test cases on an Excel/Google Sheet and start testing your code for boundary cases.

For instance, if you have written a code that takes in a Reddit Thread as an input, gathers all the comments, checks the age of the accounts on all parent comments and returns some analytics (say, how many accounts are < 1 month old, less than 1 year old, etc) on it. You will need to handle test cases where your internet isn't working, the URL is wrong, you can't parse because your authentication token to Reddit API is wrong, the thread URL is wrong, etc. Basically, everything that you can think of.   


**FAQ**

> Should I get an internship in the first year?

Ideally, I wouldn't recommend an internship. Work with personal projects / college projects / skill development. Most of the internships given out to first year students are petty work that would be wasting time. Its much easier to put this in 2nd year when you will have a strong(er) resume.

> Should I specialize in one field?

No. Personally, a lot of students restrict themselves to learning only the buzzword fields, which is wrong. What is a buzzword today might have no relevance tomorrow. Focus on learning to learn, than learning one technology or one area. Initially, learn a little bit of a lot of things and slowly specialize into a field. That way, if your specialization does not click in the market, you always have a strong fundamental to pick something else up.

> Should I do problem solving?

Personally, I would say yes. But it is optional. I feel first year is too early to dive into algorithms and data structures even though a lot of colleges do teach basics of these. If you are really interested, you can definitely spend some time everyday in solving problems on Hackerrank / Leetcode / InterviewBit. But don't overdo it.

Any other question w.r.t first year, please do ask below. I will keep updating the post with interesting questions.

I will be writing Part 2 by Friday, did not want to make it very long and I wanted to keep discussions relevant to the first year of engineering itself.",4

1)  **The Tukde-Tukde Fallacy** -

2)  **The Network thesis** - 
The ruling party had better messaging; optimized and targeted, which reached every Indian, which the opposition failed at. The missing factor from this formula: costs. This kind of campaign infra means costs on an untold scale. We've talked about ads & NaMo TV, but not call-centres, political consultancies, shadow SM ops. To put scale of the costs in perspective, the Big Five tech firms – Amazon, Apple, Fbook, Google, Microsoft – have spent just over half a billion dollars in lobbying the US Congress over 13 years, and RTI reveals that Rs 3,622 crore worth – *half a billion dollars* – of Electoral Bonds were issued in just two months of March and April (98% of it going to BJP). Read the following stories to understand how they entrench the minds of voters in their favour using this massive amount of money  

  - [How BJP marketed to a new voting bloc: the 22 crore beneficiaries](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/how-bjp-marketed-to-a-new-voting-bloc-the-22-crore-beneficiaries-5745514/)

    > The BJP used services of a company called Jarvis Technologies to map the numbers to booths so that the call centers could conduct targeted campaigning. The call centre operations began in December and were monitored from 11 Ashoka Road. “The soft message to the workers was you have to say two lines. Go there and say look, Modi has given schemes to this many families in only five years. Give him another five and you can make that number even more,”

   > A team of about 400 professionals from ABM and Jarvis steered the BJP’s initiative to micro-target voters using data analytics. BJP workers and volunteers would phone callers who dialled a specified number, get their basic details, fix up an appointment and meet them personally to deliver an information kit on the Modi campaign. “We had their specific address and areas and mobilised them to reach out to the nearest central scheme beneficiaries and collect their data through multiple events,” 

  - [How RSS Turned the Wind in Favour of BJP Four Months After Losing MP Assembly Polls](https://thewire.in/politics/rss-bjp-madhya-pradesh-win)

  > There was resentment against more than half a dozen the BJP candidates across the state. But all of them have won with a margin of more than two lakhs. Along with the Modi wave, RSS penetration proved to be an unbeatable combination. The RSS leadership drew up a strategy that was independent of BJP’s campaign. They made a list of seats where BJP seemed on a weak footing and concentrated their energies there. Throughout the campaigning season, four wings of RSS — Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, Vidya Bharati Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Sansthan, Bhartiya Majdoor Sangh and Vishwa Hindu Parishad — remained super active at the ground level, ensuring minimum vote drift to the BJP.
 
3) **The 'Respect the Mandate' fallacy.**
If you accept that Modi leads a majority in Parliament, and can continue to be PM, you're respecting the mandate. Done. Beyond that, it's your absolute right to like or dislike, interrogate or ignore the underlying factors. Most of Indian political science is interrogating the mandates of the last 16 Lok Sabhas – what forces moved Indians to vote how they did – and in no case do scholars say, 'Our starting point is that the people made the right decision.' A mandate is not the last word. It's the opposite.

[PSA] A Guide to Jobs in the field of Computer Science for Engineering Students in pre-final / final year,279,bggn06,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bggn06/psa_a_guide_to_jobs_in_the_field_of_computer/,52,1556056371.0,"  

**Statutory Warning: I work with a lot of students in the final and pre-final year of engineering and all of the interview experiences I’ve gathered is from their personal experience. While making this thread, I have consulted multiple people who work for product based, service based and start-up companies to know about their work experience and pay scale. I’ve also used LinkedIn salary and Glassdoor Salary / reviews to support my words. I am willing to modify anything if you think it is wrong!**

I see a lot of threads every week asking about the job scene in India and how to get in. I will try to put everything I know in this post. 

**Companies** 

I classify companies into 3 types

1. Product Based
2. Service Based
3. Startups

# Product Based Companies

**What are they?**

These are companies that make their own products and sell software or integration or both. Most of the “apps” that you see are examples of product based companies. Generally, it is believed that a product based company is what an engineer should aim to get into because you will be working on making a product than using the product in most cases. You will be directly involved in developing or testing a product that your company made and the chances to be exposed to the best technologies is greater

**What do they need?**

Usually in a product based firm, the training is on the job. Nobody is going to hold your hand and tell you what to do. The training will be a bunch of online videos or MOOC or just documentation(s) that you are supposed to read and figure out what you have to do. Since the job profile is going to be like this, they expect someone who can code. You should have a strong hold in at least one programming language and some companies also demand good Object-Oriented Programming skills.

**Selection Process**

Most of the good companies hire from campuses of good colleges. There will be an online platform (like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)) where you are given 2 to 3 questions. The first question is going to be an easy question to test if you can write code. The 2nd and 3rd question will aim to test your CS concepts mainly Algorithms. The 2nd question will be of medium difficulty and will usually have a brute force way to solve and an optimized way. Coding a brute force method will get you half the marks as the complex test cases will timeout. The 3rd question is usually meant to test your knowledge of implementing algorithms and problem-solving skills.

Some companies (like Uber, CodeNation, etc) hire from platforms like [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) and do not really look at what college you come from. But there is always a clause of minimum 60% academic score in most of the product based companies. Some companies take this a stretch further and even have a cut-off on 10th and 12th marks.

Linkedin jobs and Glassdoor jobs are also a good place to look out, but the response from these portals are a little slow in India!

**Interview Experience**

Once you clear the coding round, you will be shortlisted for an interview. In an interview, you will be given a problem. The problem can be a CS problem (algorithms and Data Structures) or a design problem. You are given time to think about it and they don’t usually expect you to code out a solution on the computer. You can write pseudo code and you can and MUST always share your thinking.

Some interviewers are going to give you a vague question and expect you to ask questions for more clarity. No question is a stupid question. Each interview lasts anywhere between 10 minutes to 40 minutes. Nobody is expecting a complete, correct and verifiable solution, but you cannot give totally wrong solutions.

You might be additionally quizzed on your resume. They might ask you in-depth questions about every project you have written there and ask you to justify the need for that project, why you chose the technologies, what did you learn, what were the difficulties you faced, etc. Sometimes, they might even ask you some questions related to the technologies you have mentioned on your resume.

You might have anywhere between 1 to 6 such rounds after which you will have a HR round.

Some companies use these rounds to filter candidates (i.e. only a certain number of candidates go from one round to the other) and the other companies give you a score every round and decide at the end. So, stay calm and don’t be overconfident just because you’re clearing rounds.

**How do I prepare for this?**

If you’re in college, focus in class. Subjects like Algorithms and Data Structures are qualifiers to get an interview. Once inside, you will be quizzed on Algorithms (80-85%) and the remaining 15-20% you will be asked about DBMS & Computer Networks (depending on companies)

If you did not focus on these subjects, get onto platforms like [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) / [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)/ [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/) and start solving. If you can solve a significant chunk of questions here, start solving questions from [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)/ [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) / /r/dailyprogrammer. You can also take MIT's course on Design and Analysis of Algorithm [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/). Some of the favorite questions are about Dynamic Programming, Trees, Hashing and Graphs.

**Salary & Benefits**

You can’t put a cap on salary on a product based firm. You can get anywhere between 6LPA to 12LPA (or more) as a base salary. It depends on companies. Check GlassDoor for reviews, know what the company does and see if your interests align with the company’s interest. Have a look at their official websites, know about their products and research before you go attend an interview. 

# Service Based Companies

**What are they?**

They’re companies that use the products that are available in the market and provide a service to a client. Some service based companies have developed their own products also, but most of the money in such companies comes from providing a service to a customer. Ex : Cognizant, TCS, etc

**What do they need?**

These companies are looking for someone who can wear multiple hats. When you are interviewing (as a fresher) to a service based companies, you will likely be hired under an umbrella role of “Associate” or “Engineer”. You might get into development, testing or support. Support isn’t the kind where you have to work in a call center, but its not a primarily engineering job either. The pay is less but the role can be fun depending on how much you put into work. You will have a wide array of options to come up in your career and nobody will expect a lot from you. At least not like the product based companies! 

**Selection Process**

Call for interviews are usually through walk-in interviews or an aptitude test. You will have to search websites that carter to jobs for freshers. ([TimesJobs](https://www.timesjobs.com/), [FirstNaukri](https://www.firstnaukri.com/), etc). You should be looking for an open-for-all kind of test. TCS has their own annual hiring tests, so you will have to follow TCS to know the dates. Infosys does hiring through open-to-all aptitude tests. You can also find information on the Careers section of these companies. Some smaller companies offer walk-in interviews or are found in job fairs.

Tests like [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/) also help you get interview calls. [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/) tests you for basic arithmetic aptitude, English comprehension skills, logic and reasoning skills, etc. You get a score and you wait for companies to call you for interview after [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/). 

There are also “coaching” institutes that teach you basic programming and offer you a 100% job guarantee. Most of the time, these jobs are for service based companies. The coaching fees can be anywhere between 10k to 25k. 

**Do you research before you pay for any service, don’t take my word for it**

A good entry point here is reference. If you know someone working for the company, you can get a referral and get an interview. This is very much valid here and a great percentage of hiring happens through referrals also. Many service based companies leverage your attitude over your skills. Some exploit your desperation to get you in for a lower pay.

**Interview Experience**

There isn’t a standard practice for interviews in a service based company. It basically depends on your interviewer. I know people who were asked a lot of theory questions based on their field of engineering even though the company had nothing to do with that field. But I also know people who were just asked HR-round questions like “Why do you want to join this company?” and “How would you tackle X scenario?” 

So pray to your favorite God(s) and Goddess(es) before you go for an interview. Read up about interview experiences for the company on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/index.htm) and [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/interview-experiences/) to get a rough idea of the kind of questions they might ask. Don’t be nervous!

**How to prepare?**

Basic aptitude and sometimes basic coding is what these companies look for. Basic coding means you should be able to understand what for/while/if-else if-else constructs do and maybe write a code to sort an array. Refer [IndiaBix](https://indiabix.com) for aptitude and take a programming language tutorial on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com). (You’re better off with [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp) or [Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java), but if you find them difficult start with [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python). But, eventually, move to [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)/[Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java) any one). Aim at getting 3 or 4 stars on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)!

**Salary & Benefits**

Salary can be from the range of 3 lpa to 6lpa depending on your company and interview. There is a scope of coming up in the job, but there is also a scope of getting frustrated with the job. Your job MIGHT be something as simple as forwarding tickets or something complex like fixing code or managing a service fault. But, what will get you up in this field is your dedication to work and patience. It is easier to climb into management in a service based company than it is in a product based company. While it is easier, it isn’t necessarily faster. It’s a very slow process and will take some time. So, if you lack patience or if you are looking to do a specific field of work (like, development only), this job isn’t for you.

Its relatively relaxing and you are a fish in an ocean, so the expectation the upper management has from you isn’t very high! You’ve standard benefits like insurance, variable pay / bonus, cab facility, etc. But don’t expect to be pampered :P

# Startups

**What are they?**

These are usually very small, very new companies that are in the prototype stage. They’ve just got their service out in the market. They’re MOSTLY a product-based company. They’re new, they’re young, they’re not making a lot of money currently, but they promise something big in the future.

**What do they need?**

Young, talented people who work without a lot of hand-holding. It helps if you’ve worked on technologies that they are looking for. A lot of companies use open-source tech, so its not something you need to go to classes to be trained in. Obviously, you must be able to take a lot of responsibility and write good quality code as your mentor will not be looking at every line of your code.

You are given a lot of independence, but you have a lot of responsibility too!

**Selection process**

If a start-up is coming on-campus, then they’re going to go the product company way and kick in some [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) tests. There is no single way a start-up hires. Sometimes, you will be able to get in by just calling them up and asking for an internship or emailing the HR or contacting the HR on LinkedIn. In smaller companies, you can even get in touch with the founders via LinkedIn and ask for an opportunity.

A lot of the start-ups are on [AngelList](https://angel.co/) and that can be your starting point. I think it is right to add that not all start-ups are innovative. Some “start-ups” aren’t really centers of innovation, but are only for money making. Today, if you open a coaching class that will train students in technology, you can get away by calling it a start-up. So, do your research about the company. If it is a very new company and has very few people, that isn’t usually a great company to start off with, unless, you are really interested in working on the product they have.

You can also keep a look out of Internship Fairs. A lot of the HR teams attend such fairs to hire graduates / students.

**Interview Experience**

Your interview experience will mostly likely be similar to a product company interview but not as strict. There is a mixture of skill and attitude that is considered. But if you are a complete noob, don’t expect to be hired by a start-up as they can’t afford to train you fully. You need to have some experience in some field of CS. Be it data science, application development, web development or machine learning. This is to demonstrate your ability to learn independently.

**How to Prepare?**

Hands-on, Hands-on, Hands-on! Grab a field you are interested in, go about solving small problems. The problems you solve can be as small as writing a script to automatically book tickets for the latest Avengers movie or as complex as creating a robot that can extinguish fire autonomously. 

Get good or get out!

**Salary and Benefits**

The salary isn’t standard. It depends on how old the company is, how much funding they have and how many employees are there. So, you can’t put a range. It can be as low as a service based company pays, it can be higher than what a product based company pays.

The work environment will give you a lot of independence. The offices will be more employee-friendly, you will not have someone monitoring you like a watchman 24x7 and you will not have strict policies that you’ve to adhere too. Your manager and higher management will be more approachable if you ever need to discuss something.

But at the same time, there is responsibilities too. I am reiterating this because the kind of independence you get can be a bad thing if you are used to hand-holding. This is because hand-holding is done in every step of school and college in India, either by teachers, parents or peers! That might not necessarily be the case with start-ups.

I will be writing more on Skill development, freelancing, switching jobs, etc ! Stay tuned and let me know what you thought about this. :D",4
Why is learning programming the de facto advice in this sub?,148,biwylz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/biwylz/why_is_learning_programming_the_de_facto_advice/,58,1556613311.0,"Hi everyone! I am curious about the ground reality of people saying ""learn coding"" to get a job.

In this sub whenever I see a post that is made by a teenager struggling to find a job, be it people who already graduated, seniors in college or even freaking 12th grade students who couldn't get into prestigious colleges, people always seem to suggest them to try their hands on programming.

I feel this advice is misguided for anyone except college seniors. Working in the software industry requires you to have formal knowledge about the underpinning of various technologies. And this can only be acquired by going through a formal curriculum. Seniors from other majors can pick up on this quickly as most of them have had an introductory class on computer science in their freshman year and have batchmates who are computer science majors. I have seen many non computer science majors being placed in reputed companies by ""learning coding"" in their senior year.

But when we talk about the ones who have already graduated, it becomes tremendously hard to gather resources and devote time to go through those courses. Even if someone does do that, I can't seem to understand on why a recruiter might trust you on your skills. Having a degree and internships is what leads you to a company. I think unpaid internships would be a starter for this section of job seekers. But it would be a long term payout to get a paid job and I think one can definitely do a better job to get immediate returns rather than focusing on programming.

Finally, what made me write this post today is people suggesting it to someone who couldn't score well in JEE MAINS. Most probably the OP for that post hasn't had any prior introduction to programming. Doesn't this tantamount to society's misguided opinion of engineering/medical being the only path to success. Heck, we narrowed it down to programming on this sub. I do realise it is just a suggestion, but I feel this restricts him from exploring his own interests. Not scoring well in entrance exams could be a red herring that he is on the wrong path. Maybe that is what needs amends.

I would love to stand corrected on my views. Please share your opinions on why we collectively do so.

Thanks!",4
Advice needed for B-School.,8,ccqp9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccqp9z/advice_needed_for_bschool/,1,1563061233.0,"I am doing a Bsc in Information Technology from a reputed college, placements are decent in our college, last year average was 4.5 lacs and highest was 18 lacs, this sounds pretty good for a college with very low fees but i don't see myself doing something in IT field, i cleared the entrances for VIT,KIIT,SRM,Manipal,COMEDK and few others but i did not join any of them for the very same reason, i was pushed into science by my parents and they were also forcing me to join KIIT(which i still can join) but i convinced them somehow for a Bsc as placements in KIIT were not as tempting as they had expected. I choose Bsc due to it's short duration, cost effectiveness and  curriculum was not much different from engineering if you don't include first year of engineering. 

&#x200B;

It's a relief for me that i only have to study 3 years in Bsc, now coming to the main question, at the end of three years, an MBA seems to me to be the most plausible way of getting out of this mess, my previous academics (10th,12th) are good and i can also score good my graduation.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Choose Bsc over Btech (don't like either of the two), want to do an mba.

&#x200B;

Now these are my questions :-

1) Does doing a Bsc instead of a Btech will have a negative impact during admission in B-Schools?

2) Are all these great packages that the top B-School pride themselves on are only for IITs/NITs graduates etc? 

3) What would you recommend for a person in a situation like this?

&#x200B;

If not top IIMs, i can surely get in top 10 schools.

&#x200B;

P.S - 1)My parents wanted me to do graduation only in CS,IT or Electronics, i have also cleared few entrances for BBA.

2) Money is not a problem, i'm open to all suggestions.

3) I want to go for a degree just after Bsc and don't want to work.",4

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

"An Appeal: Please, do not jail PUBG users.",296,b0yd99,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b0yd99/an_appeal_please_do_not_jail_pubg_users/,75,1552585621.0,"We cannot believe we are writing this. As per media reports which surfaced yesterday the Rajkot Police Department has arrested 7 youths for playing the PUBG online video game. Clearly things have spiralled out of control.

## A contested public debate

PUBG entered the mainstream lexicon in which the Hon'ble Prime Minister on January 29, 2019 while interacting with the concerns of a parent referred to it jovially. He clearly indicated in his remarks that, ""[*technology is a problem -- as well as a solution*](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/yeh-pubg-waala-hai-kya-pm-modi-aware-of-pubg-and-fortnite-addiction-offers-tips-on-how-to-deal-with-it-1442411-2019-01-30)"" and suggested patience and guidance as an approach for encouraging children to use their time productively. Alongside these remarks advisories were being issued by Child and Adolescent welfare bodies in some states including [Delhi](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/top-story/is-pubg-a-menace-delhi-child-rights-panel-says-game-negatively-impacts-kids/story/317245.html) and [Gujarat](https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/pubg-addiction-gujarat-government-issues-notice-to-ban-students-from-playing-pubg-or-any-other-addictive-game/352324) that the game was addictive and could cause negative impacts on children even beyond their academic performance.

It is important to take a step back this moment and consider the wider academic literature on the subject. The top three cited meta studies on Google Scholar on the general impact of gaming on adolescents indicate varying outcomes. Some even suggest benefits such as development and improvement of hand eye co-ordination (*remember the old Atari's?*).

https://i.redd.it/nfpahf4632m21.png

Yes, we may be completely wrong in an our inferences, but believe that this may be a matter for parental caution, and social debate but certainly not penal law. We explain the dangerous consequences of approaching this as a legal issue below.

## Prohibitory Order on playing PUBG

The Rajkot Police Commissioner has issued a prohibitory order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on March 6, 2019. A Section 144 order under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 is usually made to prevent illegal physical assemblies a breach of peace. While large numbers of online gamers do congregate and spend long hours in front of their smartphones or gaming consoles much to the annoyance of their friends and family such assemblies are rarely unlawful. It would be a stretch to call such activities as threatening public order.

Hence, we were surprised when a Kumar Manish posted this tweet:

We have today been able to have a [rough translation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16xDu9OqcEmEq8fRupJmcORiJv0wfpVvR/view?usp=sharing) prepared in English thanks to the help offered by Manan Bhatt.

From reading the prohibitory order, it is reasonable to infer that as per press reports, 7 youths ranging from the ages of 19 to 26 have been arrested for the breach of this prohibitory order. At this point we found ourselves bewildered and taken aback as this is seemingly a grave attack on personal liberty. We believe as the Hon'ble Prime Minister noted in his conversation that concerns on online gaming are better handled with the care and affection of a parent and teachers. Certainly not by creating fear of penal law, through prohibitory orders issued by the police and subsequent arrests. This is not only abhorrent to sensibility but offends our core fundamental rights as it lacks rationality and the reasonableness necessary in any restriction imposed by the State.

In the coming days we will be sourcing and authenticating information and taking steps including talking to a legal team based out of Gujarat. We hope to address this issue responsibly and meanwhile urge the Gujarat government to look into this matter urgently. We appeal to them -- *jailing people should not be a game*.

Need for a change of school culture and the hype around class 10th and 12th board exams,35,bn13id,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bn13id/need_for_a_change_of_school_culture_and_the_hype/,8,1557537972.0,"I am currently a Ph.D. in Biology student at a university in the United States of America. I completed my class 10th in 2006, and my class 12th in 2008. I scored 78.3% and 72% in the aforementioned board exams, respectively. During my school years, I was never a meritorious student. I was rather among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section academically. However, I worked really hard for my class 10th board exam and was deeply affected by the final percentage I scored. I did pretty well in the mock exams that I used to give at the private tuition center I took to help my academic performance and scored much more than many of friends majority of whom ended up scoring more than 85% in the final board examination.

&#x200B;

Till my class 10th, I studied at a prestigious public school in Delhi. As per the school's rule, a student could only be offered Science, if he/she scored more than 80% in English, Science, and Mathematics combined. My score was 77.7%, and therefore, was offered humanities and commerce. The rule didn't make sense as I scored 94% in Science, and my mathematics scores were always among the top 5-15% of the high scoring students in my section.  Therefore, I changed schools to study Science, and today I am earning a top-most degree in a field in which my school thought I was not a good fit.

&#x200B;

I suffered from depression and lack of confidence before my class 10th. I used to be good at cricket, but I suffered in that as well. My school carried a culture where if you are not good academically, then you are hopeless in other extra-curricular activities as well. I wanted to do academically well in school (prior to my class 10th), but the lack of confidence made it really difficult to come out of the shell and raise myself to glory (yes, being a good student did seem like a glory). I was so terrified that I would be scared to even open my textbooks.

&#x200B;

Not being able to get Science made things worse. I lost even more hope, and this worsened my mental health for my class 12th board exam. I remember praying to score at least more than 60% a night before the results. But, today if I could talk to my younger self, my recommendation would be to not lose hope and enjoy doing what you like. However, I still not sure if the environment that I lived would help. In my school days, I was compelled to feel like an outlaw for being among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section.

&#x200B;

Recently, an article came out on Hindu, about a mother congratulating her son for scoring 60% in class 10th. She says that she had seen her son struggle to the point of giving up, and therefore, was proud of the final scores he got. In my time, my parents were also in full support of me. So was my father, who had always been strict. My father would never come to the parents-teachers meeting, as I was not up to the standards he expected of me. But, after my class 10th, he was very supportive and backed me at every point possible. Getting this sort of support from this person was huge for me then. He tried his level best to make a case to my school principal as to why I deserve to be a science student for the last two years of schooling. But, I remember walking down the school corridor with my parents trying to make a last attempt to convince my school principal, I met my Geography teacher. She congratulated me sarcastically and ridiculed me (in front of my parents) of how bad of a student I was before. It has been 13 years since that gesture, but the instance is still registered in my memory from word to word.

&#x200B;

Therefore, this makes me wonder, whether how much of a support system would your parents be if you have such teachers and cultures inculcated in schools. At that time, my parent's support didn't help me much. In fact, it made me feel even more horrible for being responsible for letting them go through such tough situations. Manier times. especially I like to believe in my case, low scores in class 10th are due to a stroke of sheer bad luck. But, the impact is grave for a naive 16-year-old.

&#x200B;

The point I am trying to make is that in addition to having a good support system from one's parents, the school's culture of dealing with young students needs to change. Teachers have a big responsibility of training future entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers etc, and therefore need to pay proper regard to a students self-esteem and self-confidence. What might just seem to be a simple comment (and here I don't include the personal issues that teacher might sometime have) the repercussions on the student's mental health might be huge.

&#x200B;

Ironically, I got to know about this below-given news article from the same geography teacher's Facebook post. She was cheering this wonderful mother for her attempt to lift the pressure off the head of her son' young mind. I first felt like commenting directly about the hypocrisy she has shown to me at the least. But, I think I should probably try to let this memory go of my head and move on.

Can program a NodeJs Rest API without any framework But Can't get in College. What to do ??,7,bgfv3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bgfv3e/can_program_a_nodejs_rest_api_without_any/,38,1556051777.0,"It's a big one, TL,DR at the end.

Hey, I am 18 and just passed out from school. I did not do anything great in school. I am a average student and I suck at maths. I took science because nothing else works and i genuinely want to be a Computer Engineer. 

All though my childhood I was facilitated by computers and amazed by the Internet. So I got curious about it. I learned HTML, CSS and JS. After that I learned Java as it was in my ICSE syllabus. Then after passing class 10, Node Js  became very popular due to React/angular, so I started to learn it. I got no tution and all day I would watch Tutorials and code. I didn't do any social media. No Facebook, no Instagram and no Reddit. Just come home from school, start my computer and code.

I feel like I have a good grip over NodeJs. I know most of the core modules like http/fs/crypto. I made a Blockchain with Node as Crypto currency also fascinated me. Everything was so cool. Did not made friends , could not talk to any girl but I was happy with myself. Got 50% in class 11 finals.

In class 12 tried to focus on studies but got sidetracked very soon. Studies is so boring. Facebook came out with a new technology called GraphQL which changed how APIs communicate. Learned React(Popular JavaScript Framework), learned Haskell and golang. Made a bunch of projects, it's on my GitHub of any of you want to see.

Completely fucked my exams, some how passed. In February I got really serious and completely disconnected from internet and wiped my computer. Prepared had for ISC finals and did well.

But now the problem is I suck at Maths and I sucked at JEE mains. So I am fucked up. I did nothing what a regular teenager would do but got no reward. 

I love computers and I love to solve problems and I want to be a Computer Engineer. I don't care if I get money or not , I just love to play with computers. If I don't get in a college, I will get kicked out of my house. All this is giving me anxiety issues and causing depression

Tldr: love computers and love making cool stuff with computers but never focus on studies. What to do?

Any help?",4

I will be 29 in some months and i am the elder son of my family. My father just retired and slowly the responsibilities will come on to my shoulders. If you have something you could tell me , and decide to read further, know that once i do the act, during that time i would be showering all my love for you. I have lost all hope of having a life and being a burden on this world.
 
* I was a good student in school,in fact i was in the top,had some good programming skills then or i am not sure - it might be mugging up the whole programs and dump it out in the final exam. I even got a medal from my school with scoring 100/100 in computer science. You will see the irony of this later.

* Fucked up my 12th in science because i was homesick and had a tough time living in a hostel and because i was weak at maths. Now at this age, if you ask me some calculus which people do remember at my age - i do not. Not even 1 %. What that tells you about me?

* Prepared for medical entrance for a year paid by my father's hard earned money. Nothing came out of it. I was halfway into it and halfway hoping as if luck would be showered upon me and i would get through the entrance. But reality struck hard.

* Did Engineering in Instrumentation technology (a core stream ) from a good private college with good cgpa like around 8.5/10. But you know how i got it- i got through initial  1st 3 years studying and giving it somehow but the 4th year was tough for me- i cheated in the exams for almost all the subjects with chits and chits of paper i wrote in a minutes. 
I cheated through the exaams because i knew it was too tough for me to actually make sense of the subjects and i was afraid i might not even pass.

But all this was of no use anyway- that degree is just a certificate in a file now and is not worth a rupee now because on paper i am so and so engineer but in real life, i am a loser who has actually forgotten almost all of which i studied in those years. I guarantee that people are there who still know the fundamentals of a subject and can even give the exams after many years in engineering but i was not. My memory failed me or i caused my memory to fail - in any case i cannot remember anything of that Btech.

* Got placed in IT starting with the a company starting with the letter I - you know which one- in spite of having no spectacular programming skills and because it was not Xth std Comp Science which i had a false notion that i will be good at it and thus i chose to go with the company. 

* During the training period itself, i came to know that its too hard for me to do any actual programming. Passed after failing and giving a retest with literally some help from other kind trainees. Still i stayed there. I never left because you see on paper, i had passed but in reality i had failed.

* Got posted in Mangalore, lived there alone in a 1 RK.

* Wasted 4 years there, literally wasted in a support project where due to my inability, which may be they saw through me or just randomly , i was handed the L1 part-doing triage of the issues , and open a ticket, write a select query in Teradata, give that information to the client. Just that. Why nothing more ? Because i was too dumb to actually code or solve a real problem.

* Transferred to Bhubaneswar nearby to my home last year - just for the sake of it. I am still in the company, was on bench for almost a year and could not get project because i had no skills.
But they did not kick me out or neither i voluntarily did that.

* I am in a project right now which i got at the end of the year where they use TM1, Cognos, INFORMATICA, Unix, DB2. I literally don't know any of the technologies. Searching here and there, getting called by the leads as dumb, doing the least basic task which the lead has to explain to me - this is my life now.
On top of that , i keep on forgetting things which the lead would have told me the last week. 

I do not even understand the code other people have written in the existing systems, i do not understand how they would come up with such complex logic.

* I have lost the ability or may be never had logical reasoning skills which is needed to do programming - be it any language. I don't have the ability to think of a solution to any programming requirement, do not have the skill to divide the problem into blocks and solve it 1 by1. This is not Xth class stuff - this is the real world.
I have even lost the ability to even think of something to approach the problem.

This is my wasteful life. You know what i do instead of trying to improve - i indulge in viewing tv shows, podcasts,youtube anything to just pass time and not do something constructive.

I am a listless person with no energy to face the world. I do not have any skills to even get a different job. By the age of 29, people more or less figure how to earn for their family but i have still not figured out - nor i have the energy to think of it. 

**What is the point of living such a life ?**

I have procastinated, i have wasted my years when people try to make something out of themselves and people i know who were once below me in skills have gone on to try, struggle and are succeeding in their lives. But i did not.

Why should i exist when i am the burden on my world now (my father and mother although they are trying to help me but they cannot because i have reached the end) ? 

I am a wasteful, pathetic loser in life now.I do not even an ounce of energy to solve my problems. I somehow think if i take out myself out of the equation of lives of my family and they somehow forget that i ever existed, it will be great. I have no friends now as well.

I do not blame anyone for the condition i am in right now, it was me and me only. In spite of knowing that i am wasting time and instead of doing something constructive - anything, i indulge in viewing shows/songs/podcasts just to fill that time and get that moment of fleeting happiness.

Now dear reader, if you have read this far of my wasteful life i have lived, what will you tell me? That there is still hope - but i know there isn't. That somehow you will come out of it - but i know this will never happen.

Why should i not jump out of this balcony i am standing now and end this constant misery i am in? 

Why?

Now, my university is going to force me to take their summer training on web development which is the thing that I totally hate. My SGPA is 8.76 as I focused more studies and less on learning any specific technology. I have some projects but, only one big project in which I developed a program for the tech event that was hosted in our university. 

My area of interests are Data Science, Computer Vision, and Psychology. I tried to get into Data Science but, seniors said that learn Mathematics first. When I tried Computer vision, they said learn linear algebra first. So, I started learning linear algebra as well. So, now I am just banging head over books.  I don't know what to do, I am stuck. 

I don't want to waste my summer attending something that I am not interested in, please guide me. 


Thank you!

Life at crossroads.. Please help.,26,b4w7e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4w7e9/life_at_crossroads_please_help/,17,1553462035.0,"Hello everyone, 

I'm pretty stuck now. I am 23 and due to various reasons I haven't been able to pursue a good education. I had to stop at 11th and it's been years now.. I've been depressed so far and have only recently started to recover. 

I don't have anyone to turn to regarding the advice I seek.. What can I do with my life now? I have heard differing opinions and my first choice was to choose a regular college... but I don't know if they accept people at my age. To be clear, I can only apply at 24 since I would need to finish 12th this year. Should I choose NIOS for that or something else? Is going to a regular college an option for me?

The other option is distance learning and I have heard polarising views on it. IGNOU would have to be it but is it really worth it? Should I just go to a regular college if I'm able to? 

I'm also stuck regarding what to do for 12th, I would like to do science stream but since I haven't been taught anything for years, the maths and science is expected to be quite tough for me. The other option is humanities, which is easily my strength however, I am looking to study and get into an IT field. Psychology was my preferred option but I would need to study around 7-8 years for to be a clinical psychologist. I don't mind that but realistically, it isn't a great option since I'll be around 30/31 then. So I've decided to go for my second option, I'm trying to study programming on my own and try to get ahead with it. But I'd need a degree, would it be better I get it from a distance learning course or regular? If so, would BCA/MCA or BTECH/MTECH be good? It looks to be pretty tough considering I haven't touched any higher level maths. But, I'm willing to work. Please offer any advice, I'll take anything.

Or do you guys recommend something else for me? My strengths are that I'm good at speaking English and I generally have a good knack with languages. I'm good at subjects such as history, sociology and psychology. I'm good with technology and IT field interests me greatly.",4

As a home to numerous religious and ethnic groups, India has a number of laws against hate speech that fall under the “reasonable restrictions” to freedom of expression permitted in the Indian Constitution. Specifically, Sections 124A, 153A, 153B, 292, 293, and 295A of the Indian Penal Code prohibit any words or representations that insult any individual’s or group’s religious beliefs, or that are meant to incite enmity against a particular religion. The punishment for hate speech is a fine, imprisonment for up to three years, or both. Members of all of India’s faith groups can and do utilize anti-hate speech legislation when their religious sensibilities are hurt. Recent arrests include newspaper editors for articles criticizing the public nudity of certain Jain monks and arguing for the right to critique any religion, the latter of which angered Muslims; unprosecuted complaints have been filed by Buddhists against an actress who posed nude against a Buddha statue, and by Hindus against an athlete who ate beef during a cricket match.

Opinion
In the light of these policies and the overly polarizing society over religion I would like to state to right wing majoritarian bias this which has been developing.
Despite the famously secular constitution of the world’s largest democracy, concerns about Hindu nationalism and interreligious tension have risen under the premiership of Narendra Modi. Playing into this threat, “blasphemy” laws exist and are being increasingly used and cited.
Section 295 of the Indian Penal Code criminalises insult to religion; it allows up to three years imprisonment and fines for “whoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class of citizens of India, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of a class.”
In addition, in 2011 the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology issued new rules requiring operators of social media networks to screen and remove blasphemous content within 36 hours of receiving a complaint.
In January 2015, the well-received and record-breaking high-grossing Bollywood film PK satirised problems with religion through the eyes of an alien in human form. It was criticised by Hindu nationalists who disliked its satire on “godmen” and called for a ban on the film and a the arrest of its star Aamir Khan and the filmmakers.
Director and writer Rajkumar Hirani responded by explaining, “In fact, with PK, I am saying that we are humans first and not Hindus or Muslims. Everyone should have the freedom to live and get settled with whoever they want to”.
In April 2012, the Catholic Church filed a complaint under Section 295 of the country’s penal code against Sanal Edamaruku, president of the Indian Rationalist Association. Edamaruku had reportedly exposed a supposed “miracle” by revealing that a weeping Jesus on the cross was actually the result of a leaky drain. The local police requested Edamaruku turn himself in and face the charges. He now lives in exile in Finland.
On August 20, 2013, leading anti-superstition campaigner Narendra Dabholkar was shot and killed by two men on a motorbike. The murder came just days after the state government pledged to re-introduce an anti-superstition bill, aimed at making it an offence to exploit or defraud people with ‘magical’ rituals, charms and cures. This bill was closely associated with Dabholkar’s work, and was opposed by many rightwing and Hindu nationalist groups who labelled it “anti-Hindu”.

From <https://end-blasphemy-laws.org/countries/asia-central-southern-and-south-eastern/india/> 

In the more recent news people like Yogi Adityanath and Sadvi Pragya have critizied those who do not follow the principles of hindutva to the point of down right attacking them claming them to be anti religion and anti national. Which would mean that any one who critics the Polarizing hindutva ideology is a anti-national even tho in reality the principles of Hindutva in all aspects against the long standing tradition of Indian culture. It was rightly said by Dr. Shashi Tharoor in his book ""why I am a Hindu"" states that India is not in its ecence a secular [implying the separation of religion from public matters] but a pluralist nation in its functioning, that is to say that that the Indian society as a whole and the government has a active role in the religious functioning of the society, equally for each religious sect. in simple terms the government of India grands national holidays on all religious festivals for all the recognized religions, instead of giving no holidays for any religious festival. He in his book has very clearly defined the distinction between Hindutva and Hinduism, an who miss guided the right wing is unable to differentiate between the obsolete and legally problematic idea of Cultural nationalism, believing Indian culture is solely hindu, and ignoring the fact that the nationalism which is best suited for every one is territorial Nationalism, which allowed every India regardless of all secondary identifiers of his individual identity, to pledge his or her allegiance to the nation and the values enshrined in the constitution while being able to critic others for their fallacies and praise them for their good deeds with out this loyalty to a cause be questioned. But we follow the procedure of the right wingers Tharoor should be an anti national who doesn't understand the values of the country. 
The actions and statement of the right wingers, who claim to up holed the ancient roots of India, violet the above mentioned sections in so many ways. This dose not apply just to the politician of stage but the large masses of people who support such people, and are the ground work of the polarizing  tactics which are aimed at the policy of divide and rule. It is not the center actively supports it, but it dose turn a blind eye to such problems in many cases. There are many postes and memes on the internet which violates the above mentioned Penal code sections, and yet they are ignored as they do not create drastic social upheavals. Yet these circulated in enough number to start a slow buildup in the momentum towards t a society moving towards polarizing ideas, and these masses change the out look of the society and ultimately end up in a group large enough to vote people like the Yogi and potential the Sadhvi into power. The consequences of this is already seen in the state of UP. I ma not saying that the Yadav government was any better in improving the life's of the people, but the BJP has changed the out look and from of the political momentum. Never has a  religious figure come to the power of a elected office in India, and it would be foolish to assume that the ideals of tolerance and equality would be met  as expected, which no hit to ward favoritism towards the religion of the elected official. 
The vague definition of Defamation and insult has given rise to the more frequent invocation of the above mentioned section of the India Penal Code, when ever the majorities views are challenged, and when the same is done to the minorities their voices are suppressed as the people in power openly criticize the victims them self's, or just turn a blind eye. There are many places due to this, majorly in North India where a cow has more support and protection than a Human who followed a different faith from the mainstream majority. And in many cases where there have been a probe into  these matters there is little attention payed to why the people become so fanatic to kill some one over their beliefs, and rather focused on forensics to confirm where the meat was of that of a cow or not. Implying that if the meat was that of a cow, the lynch mob did the right thing? Ludicrous!!

I Personal y think that blasphemy should not be a crime at all as it is a strong infringement of freedom of speech. I find it unfair that may religions can put up posters and legally have the right to promote their religion. But as and Athies if is were to put a banner starting 'god I'd not real stop wasting time and money behind imagenay entities' I am sure I would offend enough people to get me charged with a lot of things, and my banner will be brought down and most likely there would be a mob man hunting me, because they just love their scape goats.",4
To Redditors of Kolkata,1,bpgagr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpgagr/to_redditors_of_kolkata/,0,1558060692.0,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.

"What is the most practical, innovative way to manage plastic waste in metropolitan cities?",27,a39gnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a39gnj/what_is_the_most_practical_innovative_way_to/,34,1544018271.0,"What, according to you, is a practical approach to plastic waste management in the cities?

Is the crux of the problem awareness of the junta or execution by the municipal corporation to provide effective machinery and systems to tackle garbage?

There are various categories in this kind of management. For example, technology, packaging, research (citizen science) or just awareness. What according to you does India need right now? 

I recently watched videos on how birds die after eating plastic. Their stomachs are full of small tiny plastic bits, some upto 200 small pieces. They eventually choke on a piece and die. This is common near the beaches.

IT-to-Neuroscience?,6,b4fjxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4fjxb/ittoneuroscience/,0,1553348457.0,"Hi, 

Currently I am pursuing PhD in information technology. However, my work is progressing toward neuroscience (which I found as my energy converging point). Currently, I am studying emotions. Due to IT background, I am pretty well with the coding skills and applying it for customised high end GPU based calculations on voxel wise activity given some task. Although, I always have this feeling of lack of sufficient knowledge in the field of neuroscience. Although, I am trying my best to learn as much as possible but missing a disciplinary thinking while facing a complex puzzle. Although, I find myself studying about the neuroscience stuff without any sense of exhaustion, a leap step is needed to get deeply indulged in this exciting and important domain.

As it is a transition period for me where I need to use my relatively more developed computational skills to get the sense and pleasure of getting new in-depth knowledge of the field of brain science. I am seeking for the suitable guideline which can give me a better chance to grab the domain knowledge during this transition and lead me towards disciplinary thinking over more complex problems. I am interested in further studying emotions and related disorders. The guidelines during the PhD and after the PhD both are very much needed and highly appreciated.

"Digital Colonisation: the fight for India's soul, and for the rest of the world, begins with individual privacy online. It's time to fight back against Silicon Valley. But... how?",3,at9hy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/at9hy3/digital_colonisation_the_fight_for_indias_soul/,4,1550817361.0,"Next to Aadhaar, Facebook may be the greatest modern threat against privacy. How do we fight back and keep Facebook from colonising India?

> ""The business model of the internet is surveillance. We build systems that spy on people in exchange for services. [Corporations call it marketing.](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/surveillance_is_the.html)""

Have you noticed? Whenever someone says ""you're being **too political**"", it usually means ""you've mentioned a group of people I don't care about"".

Or **they gaslight you** -- saying you're ""crazy"" for not being white, male, straight, or ""American"" enough. If you dare to notice the discrimination built into their systems, they try to distract from the issue by **attacking you as a person**, trying to force you to jump through endless hoops of arbitrarily defined ""moral purity"".

**This is the typical response on Reddit.** Silicon Valley's social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) was built by them, for them. ""Them"" means entitled middle-class white males. More specifically: _middle-class, white, aged between 18 and 49, male, cisgender, heterosexual, and mostly American_ males. They built social media for themselves and their friends. The rest of us are unwelcome guests in their safe space.

# **Free Speech versus Diversity?**

This is why the rest of us (non-white, women, LGBT, and others) are treated so badly on their systems. They refuse to ban racist, or violent misogyny and homophobia because it would hurt ""free speech"". Their persecution anxiety leads their bigotry behind slogans like ""diversity is the problem"", ""don't shove _your diversity_ in my face"". George Orwell would be proud (or horrified) to see such twisting of words in service of harmfully bad ideas.

> Here's an analogy: nuclear power can be used to power entire cities and give millions of people energy for centuries, or destroy cities and commit genocide in the blink of an eye. Should we allow the secrets and materials for nuclear to proliferate everywhere, because it's ""just science"" and ""knowledge wants to be free""? Of course not.
> 
> Should we allow bigotry and hatred to rule on social media because it's ""just speech"" and ""information wants to be free""? Of course not.

Now you see the bigotry hidden in Silicon Valley talk about ""free speech"". It's free for them, and the costs are left for us to bear. This is the same as patterns of colonisation throughout the history of Western civilisation. History has begun to repeat itself on the internet.

In other words, they have no grasp of basic morality for anyone who isn't like them. And as you'll see here, that means people in India, Brasil and around the world are now starting to die.

## **Aadhaar's Failure is Facebook's Success**

The question here begins with privacy.

Aadhaar is well-known for allowing unauthorised access to [private information of millions of India's citizens](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aadhaar-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/story-VhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wO.html). People are concerned, are rightfully so.

In the case of Facebook, selling your privacy to the highest bidder is the entire profit model. That's why Facebook is ""free"". It's as if Aadhaar's privacy-destroying mistakes are Facebook's business plan.

For India, a country where [69% of citizens live in rural areas](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS), this means that over 300 million people (those who have smartphones) are at risk. And unlike the Indian government's dependence on the will of the people, Facebook is completely unaccountable to anyone but their company shareholders.

# **Facebook's Plan to Colonise India**

Starting in 2014, [Facebook tried to give away free Internet to rural India](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-india-doesnt-want-free-basics). The bargain was simple: if you use internet through Facebook, we give it to you for free. That really means, ""if you allow us to watch, record and sell data about every move you make online, we'll give you access to a limited amount of internet for no cost.""

Thankfully, India's regulators eventually said no, and in 2016, the Free Basics program was stopped.

## **Facebook and Bollywood**

If you've watched any Bollywood films over the past few years, there are two names you'll see and hear all the time. You can probably guess. No, it's not SRK or Deepika Padukone. Also not Salman Khan or Katrina Kaif.

The two names are Facebook and WhatsApp.

Again in rural India, WhatsApp has been involved in [an increasing number of murders](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2017/12/deadly-rumours-india-whatsapp-dilemma-171216091928319.html). The culprit is rumours and intentional misinformation that spread via Facebook's messaging service (WhatsApp).

Even though Facebook's attempts to colonise India are blatant (the Free Basics program) and have led to several deaths (WhatsApp), they are still making more efforts.

Instead of regulators, they are trying to convince citizens that Facebook is good by having celebrities constantly use the service in Bollywood films.

You may not have known this, but Instagram and WhatsApp are owned by Facebook. Now think of how many times you've seen films where the real stars in the background are social media accounts on someone's smartphone. (There's even a Reddit community [specifically for Indian people praising Facebook...!](https://np.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/))

# **Democracy, Immigration, Misinformation and Disinformation**

Now think about how easily democracy has been subverted in places like the United States, Britain and Brasil. In the U.S., the Trump campaign openly acknowledged targeting [millions of young women and black voters through Facebook](http://fortune.com/2016/10/30/trump-voter-supression-operations/) to suppress their votes, since they tend to vote Democrat (not Republican; Trump is a Republican). In the case of Brexit, [hundreds of fake Twitter accounts also spread disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/how-400-russia-run-fake-accounts-posted-bogus-brexit-tweets).

As more children and adults in mass detainment centres, the American immigration service (ICE) is [using users' private Facebook data to target and hunt down immigrants](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-facebook-data-track-immigrants).

# **To prevent colonisation of our digital lives, we must fight back for our right to privacy.**

So how can we fight against amoral companies like Facebook (with WhatsApp and Instagram) and Twitter?

We now know that [""free"" access via Internet advertising is just another word for intrusive surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/24/deep-surveillance-is-price-of-a-free-web-advertising). We know that in rural India, where many are less educated, people are dying because of misinformation spread through social media. And we know since 2016, that as long as Facebook and Silicon Valley can get away with it, they don't care.

There needs to be an alternative, and it needs to come from the people who are most affected. Not another Facebook, Orkut, Reddit or Twitter, created by white men, for white men -- and if anyone else wants to join, they'd better not be too ""political"". The web is run by narcissists and bullies now, and there has to be a better way.

I'm working with a project that is creating a new social network, but if this post inspires you to start something for India and the rest of the world, I'd be glad to work with you, too. And if you're just hearing some of these facts for the first time, it's okay to be angry. Get angry enough to do something right now. The stakes are too high now to just shrug, turn away and take another selfie: if we let Silicon Valley take our privacy away, they will never give it back.",4

The only function this robot could do was roll around with remote control and respond to a simple touch screen press.

This is the technology we were showcasing to the world.

On the other hand, we have Boston Dynamics. I remember seeing their Big Dog robot almost a decade back and it had blown my mind back then. See how it corrects itself even after being kicked:

Organisations like silverzone and SOF are ruining the prestige of olympiads in India.,188,8r87e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8r87e7/organisations_like_silverzone_and_sof_are_ruining/,53,1529065445.0,"As most of you DO NOT know, there are 6 major olympiads organised for school students (there are 12 major science olympiads, but these 6 offer the most incentives).

These are->

1) International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO)

2) International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)

3) International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)

4) International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO)

5) International Astronomy Olympiad (IAO)

6) International Olympiad of Linguistics (IOL)

All of these are extremely prestigious olympiads, which one can not take part in directly. They have various stages in which they sieve out children, and in the end a team of 4-6 children represents a country in these international olympiads. Olympiads organised by silverzone/SOF are misdirecting people into a false sense of prestige, and are making big bucks doing so. They sell admit cards, workbooks, text books, past year papers and whatnot. They even go as far as to copy the names of these olympiads exactly as they are.

Here's an incident: A friend of mine is an IMO bronze medallist, and he shared this fact one day with his relatives. His aunt was quick to respond that her daughter was in fact a gold medal holder in IMO. When he asked which year was the IMO, and where it was held, she told him that the olympiad took place in her daughter's school just a week ago. Here's the kicker, the real IMO has never taken place in India since its inception, and only 11 people in India have won a gold medal.

Just wanted to let out this quick rant. Dont waste your money on these hoax olympiads, and then go on and brag about how your child is a gold medal holder.

A few colleges in India offer admission on the basis of participation in these olympiads, and I was shocked when people from silverzone/SOF olympiads were lining up to claim their seats. Needless to say, they all got rejected, but what was even sadder is that they did not even know about the big 6 olympiads.

If you have been selected into the training camp of any of these 6 olympiads, you can get admission to Chennai Mathematical Institute(one of the best mathematics school in india) and IIIT-H(International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad). You are also selected for an interview at ISI(Indian Statistical Institute) if you have been a member of IMO-TC(training camp for IMO). These are some of the incentives to participate in these olympiads.

EDIT: correction, IMO was held in India once in 1996

EDIT2: India actually participates in almost all the major olympiads.",4
Short concise interactive books for college students. Indian education system in bad shape.,4,9xldhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9xldhp/short_concise_interactive_books_for_college/,9,1542396558.0,"I am a computer science college student from India. I found that students always complain about the education system, the poor quality of teachers and teaching methods (and I am one among them, it's awful in India at least) . At the same time some teachers also complain that students don't do any self study at all. They are always looking for shortcuts, like reading an article or some videos here and there to pass the exams .

If we think from the student point of view, it's very difficult for them to read books and get in-depth knowledge for so many subjects every semester at the same time following your passion (which is most of the time , unrelated to the courses they are taking) and taking part in extra curricular activities at college, learning cool technologies to become job ready. Hence it's actually not possible for them to sit down and read through 500 pages books for each subject, do assignments honestly .

I have an idea to solve this problem. If we can develop short (around 100 pages) books for every subject , which are interesting to read and at the same time give students a overall view of the subject to pass the exam. This will help them get a complete picture rather than the fragmented knowledge they get from internet , which is mostly pointless. Through a collaborative platform online , we can get this book developed by the best people in the community and make it available for everyone to read for free.

This is my idea in very brief, I would love to know your opinions and indulge in further discussion if anyone is interested.",4
I hate summers!,11,9c4cu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9c4cu9/i_hate_summers/,21,1535847915.0,"Disclaimer: My previous post was removed, reason looked more like an excuse and my appeal wasn't answered. Here I'm posting it again. It's about climate i promise, nations are included as relevance and examples for my arguments, not for personal attacks.
My previous [post is archived here.] (https://www.scribd.com/document/387542089/Enjoying-summers-Me-too-s)

I'm from Northern part of India, this little state once upon a time called as breadbasket of India, you guessed it, Punjab.  It might have lost its charm over the years but it's still one of the best place to live in India except one thing: The weather.  

I loathe the weather here, leave aside the first 4 weeks, it's literally a swamp for rest of the year, unbearably hot and humid. As a kid who grew up in Amritsar, I remember when i used to play in the fields outside my house in the monsoons, The fields are covered in concrete now. 

Fast-forward to today, I'm now an adult aged 19. My body has gained mass and stature of a man but what it hasn't gained is Mr. Freeze's Freeze-Ray to keep my cerebral cortex cool. Unless you stay inside an air-conditioned environment or wear some alien OptiTemp suit, you can't stop the heat from bogging down your cognitive functions. It's a fact!

Peak of human Intelligence seldom can be achieved in hot humid climates hence the IQ disparity between the inhabitants of temperate and tropical regions. 

Almost all developed nations are in the temperate zone barring Russia and North Korea (due to decades of Communist mismanagement). Tropical regions are mostly poor except for Bangalore-sized tiny nations like Abu Dhabi (Oil), Singapore (strategic sea hub location) etc.

If you compare within countries in the temperate zone, there's an intellectual divide between their northern and southern regions. Take Italy for example, Southern Italy is comparatively more corrupt and poor than Northern Italy. As such there's a clear correlation between climate and intelligence. This holds true for USA and Japan too. These are wealthy nations who can afford to run AC 24x7.

According to the Cold Winter theory by Richard Lynn,  Ancestors of Europeans and North-East Asians faced extreme winters thus higher intelligence would've evolved and those who didn't develop intellect, perished. Going by this, Eskimos should have the highest IQ on Earth which isn't the case but wait, the author has something to say about it.

    ""Lynn  (CWT, p. 144)  argued that high intelligence can  only  
    evolve in  large populations because mutations, being chance 
    events, are more  likely to occur in large populations. Arctic
    people have smaller  populations than Asians or Europeans and
    therefore mutations beneficial to intelligence did not occur.""

Well, intelligence is a complex topic and it is influenced by host of factors like genetics, culture, birth environment etc. Cold weather is beneficial for brain and yields the easiest intelligence boost without winning a genetic lottery. 

The energy required for cooling human body is greater than warming it up. Also, the brain guzzle up to 20% of total energy, since glucose is also used to regulate temperature of the brain in hot weather, less is spared for the process of cognition.

The people who ruled India for almost 200 years, the mighty British have been living on an Island where yearly day temperature is half that of India, 15C vs 31C. UV Radiation is also quite low and so is the scorching sunlight hours. Contrary to popular belief, dark winters don't cause depression. 

[For science]
Okay, these smartypants from the north aren't heatproof. Consider this scenario. If we were to put some of them on an isolated place without education, knowledge and access to any human technology in existence. Only children can be perfect subjects, So thousands of 5 to 12 years old on a big island (or a continent perhaps) in middle of the equator. They'll  explicit the same behavioral tendency of any equatorial human in the first generation itself, angry, lazy and unproductive. They'll procreate, form languages and religions, adapt to hot humid weather, they'll be too busy killing bugs and sheltering from heat, no energy for intellectual reasoning. 500-2000 years have gone by, their IQ has plummeted to new depths. It's now more comparable to Congolese. Several millennia has passed, their skin now exhibits more melanin than ever to protect them from sun. Suddenly one day, A big ship landed on their shore.

""Terra nullius? ^spots ^a ^man  Hello primitive folks! Wassup? Oh god it's so hot in here! Ah! Sunscreen in a jar of honey, you slaves gonna make me money!""
[/don't flame me]

Enough, The rich northern countries are one who are more worried about the climate change, maybe they might invent some artificial clouds or climate alternation tech once it start becoming unbearable there. The way things are moving now, inhabitability of Indo-gangetic plains in my lifetime is evident.

I am planning a new digital learning initiative. I need your help.,20,8rsrvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8rsrvc/i_am_planning_a_new_digital_learning_initiative_i/,12,1529287273.0,"I have just finished my school education in science in India, and am deeply concerned about the state of affairs. I wish to target specific areas.

Some complain that the system promotes ‘rote memorization’ and that the syllabus is ‘too theoretical’ and is not ‘practical’ or ‘linked with everyday life’.

The system is far worse than that.

In classes 1 to 10:

There is a heavy emphasis on regurgitation of memorised material.

There is too much ‘flab’ in the syllabus.

There is very less rigour in the subjects of maths and science.

The school textbooks are by no means enough to gain a comprehensive picture of a subject, but the line of questioning is such that you don’t need anything more than the textbooks.

There is not much focus given on seeing if students are capable of analysing new information and making pertinent observations.

Further questioning from the students’ side has no real outlet within the traditional syllabus.

In classes 11 and 12:

The rate at which information is to be consumed and understood increases dramatically.

The school textbooks are by no means enough to completely understand a subject BUT understanding is necessary to be able to survive the examinations.

Rote memorisation is an impediment, not an aid to success.

The line of questioning is far from direct. You need stop treating the syllabus as a body to remember, but as a set of tools in your arsenal to fix the problem. You have to generate independent results from the tools you are given.

Every piece of information in the syllabus is important and useful for examinations. There is nothing that you can’t know.

In the world of competitive exams:

You need to go well beyond the given syllabus.

You need to be able to think very creatively and come up with innovative solutions.

Emphasis is given on the ability to manipulate learnt content within extreme time constraints to solve the situation.

You can see the problem, can’t you? For the first 10 years of formal education, when they are in their most neurologically adaptive state, we expect students to have this conformist, regurgitative attitude towards academics, and then, when they are nearly adults, we expect them to have the analytical and creative problem-solving abilities of mini-Einsteins.

There are three categories of students who survive this catastrophe.

The real prodigies. These students quickly learn to move ahead of the existing syllabus and go onward. I respect and admire them.

Those whose circumstances give them a head start. This was me. I hated rote memorisation so I would do the bare minimum necessary. I’m not saying that I performed bad, academically, in classes 1 to 10. It’s just that where the others were busy memorising whole passages verbatim, I was looking at a few key words and facts and building up the rest in the exam hall. That’s the only way I kept a facade up despite a lousy work ethic. Since I was already accustomed to never memorising, it was mainly a matter of adjusting to the new rate and new depth.

Those who can work really, really hard. I admire the sheer determination of this category, and they often overlap with 1. and 2. , but many of them continue with the verbatim approach and clear the struggle by memorising every case and every type of problem possible.

We need to fix this. We need to expose students to a problem-solving based curriculum from day one. We also need to make the syllabus far less top-heavy. With just one or two more chapters in each subject every year, we could have the whole of class 1 to 10 over a couple of years earlier.

In the traditional system, I would have said that this is impossible. It needs a curriculum change, reskilling of teachers, change of public policy, bulldozing public opinion that school is becoming ‘harder’, and forcing experimental teaching and evaluation methods on schoolchildren.

In the digital world, creating an adaptive learning system for such a goal is a far less difficult challenge.

In my ‘ideal-scenario’ curriculum, I would focus on only four skills:

Critical reading: In the current scenario, learning the ‘chapters’ is given more emphasis than on checking if students can actually process new passages of information. Most students are unable to self-learn and are dependent on spoonfeeding for this reason.

Critical writing and grammar: I don’t mean the typical ‘parts-of-speech-in-detail’ grammar. I just mean being able to differentiate between correct and incorrect English grammar and being able to apply it to express new ideas. Once students can do this, they no longer have to memorise passages to answer in exams — they can construct their own sentences.

Arithmetic and geometry: Pretty self explanatory.

Logical reasoning: This is not subject-specific. It should be done in a way which is independent of any particular technical subject. In the JEE, the content is based on PCM, but they actually test us on our critical thinking and logical reasoning ability — using the subject as a medium. We don’t have to use any prerequisite subject.

I need the help of subject curriculum and testing experts, web designers, teachers, students, and anybody else who feels that they can contribute to this project.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you saw my above post, then you know what this is about.

I really, really need help from experts in both education (in both STEM and liberal arts) and technology implementation (primarily web design, UX/UI etc.)

Otherwise, I guess it is up to only me to revise 12 years of syllabus for a broken system, rewrite and execute lecture videos, come up with suitable assessments, code the adaptive assessment system, build the website, and deploy it.

All of that, assuming I already know how to do it, would take at least a year for one person to execute -- that's assuming they are working full time.

Which I can't.

And that's if I knew how to do everything by myself.

Which I don't.

What this means is that without help, this project in it's current form will be over before it even got started.

Even if you can't join the core dev team, it would be a huge step forward if you could direct me somehow to find the support I need for this project.

Thanks,

Planner

> [The Indian martial art -Kalaripayattu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aevd3Vqylk)

>>In this documentary, we look at one of the world's oldest and most dangerous martial arts: Kalarippayattu. Closely linked to Hinduism, Kalari means: battlefield/gym and Puttara means: platform/stage. This may translate loosely into something like ""Fight Club""!

>>This fighting art was only used by a special class of warriors in ancient times of war to protect their king and masters -they would fight to the death.

>>Practitioners of this art believe that animals are the best fighters because they're natural and don't have to think about what they're doing. They simply...act -instinctively!

>>The British outlawed this art, out of fear while they occupied India.

>>Martial artists of this style don't normally train with metal weapons until they've practiced for 6 years with the standard wooden ones.

>>Jimmy Smith, the professional MMA fighter has a large Ganesh (""Remover of Obstacles"" elephant god) tattoo on his back!


> Interestingly, according to legend and on observation and analysis of the movements involved, many say that Kalarippayattu is the source of Shaolin kung-fu. It was said to be taken by Bodhidharma or Da Mo: The legendary monk who took Buddhism to China (circa 500 AD).

> He is the 28th patriarch of Buddhism, credited with founding ""Zen Buddhism"" and is popularly considered as the patron saint or the founding father of Shaolin Kung-fu. He is believed to have been the 3rd son of the Pallava king Sugandan and his birthplace is considered to be the ancient Pallavan capital city- Kanchipuram. 

> Being a member of a royal family he had to have had a military education and training on order to one day succeed his father. He trained in the Indian martial art of kalaripayattu which is considered to be one of the oldest fighting systems in existence.

What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,6,918ek7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/918ek7/what_are_the_options_for_parttime_undergraduate/,3,1532391253.0,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

**TL;DR: Which Universities/Colleges in/near Hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech/science?** ",4
When and how to apply for off campus jobs in India?,3,96qhws,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/96qhws/when_and_how_to_apply_for_off_campus_jobs_in_india/,3,1534122080.0,"I am a Btech computer science student, and have started 4th year of engineering. My college is mediocre and moreover my CGPA is a bit on the lower side, thus I might not be able to sit in campus placements of many companies. But to compensate for it I have many small and big projects in my portfolio on technologies like android, web development, python, django, basic ML, reactjs and ethereum blockchain. I have learned these things on my own through internet. I am OKish but not that good in DS/algo. I might not get a campus placement due to low cgpa and also due to not being good in DS/algo. I am passionate about programming and I want to work in decent companies/ startups where I can further improve my stack. How to find such jobs? What should be my strategy? I am currently in 7th semester, should I start searching immediately? Do most off campus companies require immediate joining (I still have a year to get my degree finished)? It would be great if anyone with a similar experience could share their insights.",4
How's IIIT Jabalpur? And BIT Mesra?,10,8gqdc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8gqdc8/hows_iiit_jabalpur_and_bit_mesra/,10,1525382984.0,"With my current rank I can get CSE at IIIT Jabalpur, Information Technology at BIT Mesra, CSE at NIT Srinagar and at newer NITs. I'm interested in doing CS/Math/Physics/Econ (more inclined towards CS) and want to do master's from a good foreign Univ (because higher education is not so good here). I'll get SRCC, Hindu, Hansraj for Eco/Math/Physics.

I'm afraid that probably I won't get good LoRs from IIIT Jabalpur or BIT Mesra. Besides, professors there are not good. What should I do?

I want a career in data science/ML. I have done some projects in ML and I love doing that. However, I am flexible.

This is how falsehoods spread: Smriti Irani on how Fields Medalist Manjul Bhargava teaches math,146,5sygz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5sygz4/this_is_how_falsehoods_spread_smriti_irani_on_how/,103,1486651209.0,"Manjul Bhargava is a famous Fields Medalist of Indian origin who teaches at Princeton. His nationality is Canada/US. He was born and brought up there but also visited India on holidays.

Like many other mathematicians he has compared poetry and music to mathematics. He has studied Sanskrit poetry at college level. Here is a quote from him

> ""As a child, I enjoyed studying Sanskrit, Sanskrit poetry and Indian classical music. I saw maths in all these things; that further inspired me to pursue mathematics. When I went to college, I took Sanskrit, a lot of music, computer science and physics, and also mathematics. To me, mathematics was the common thread in all these subjects""

As a lover of Sanskrit language, I know the distance between the statements “Panini’s grammar precedes any formal grammar by two millennia” and “Sanskrit is compulsory to get a job at NASA”. Then there is a rainbow of truths and falsehoods between them.

Here is an excerpt where our Education Minister (then) explains how Bhargava teaches math at princeton (at 1m30s):  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GGkIiZou5I&t=1m30s

> In Princeton, in his class — which is the most famous — is “Mathematics for Non-Mathematicians”. I have had the privilege of having talks with Manjul on many occasions and I know him well. And I asked him — what excites you most about teaching that class. **He said, I teach that class in Sanskrit and poetry from India**, and poetry that my mother got from her house in Jaipur. Now imagine Manjul trying to do the same in India …

Aside: the victimhood continues. She can’t imagine a math/cs professor talking about Panini when teaching BNF etc in an IIT. Imagine!

But more importantly, she is outrightly spreading falsehoods about Bhargava. I have followed his work and also his media appearances for some time. He is very mindful of what he speaks. He can never say something as stupid as “I teach my math class in Sanskrit”.

What does this mean? Is Irani actually that stupid that she can’t understand what Bhargava is saying to her? Or like always, she is again spreading falsehoods?

EDIT: The link to the course in question:  
https://www.math.princeton.edu/undergraduate/course/MAT190

> Topics will include Number Patterns and sequences (2 wks.); Math in music and visual arts (2 wks.); Platonic solids, origami and the math of shapes (1 wk.); The Island of Zeke and other Logic Puzzles (1 wk.); Basic probability questions such as; how likely is it that 2 people in a class of 25 have the same birthday? (2 wks.); Modular arithmetic and prime numbers (3 wks.); Applications to technology, communications codes and cryptography (2 wks.)

"India is not a country, it is a union of countries",21,6w8oqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6w8oqs/india_is_not_a_country_it_is_a_union_of_countries/,44,1503816572.0,"Ever since I can remember, I have wanted to improve the state of affairs of this country fundamentally. As a millennial, when I was young I was inspired by our independence and the patriotism that followed it. But as I grew and explored what the nation of India intrinsically meant and what it’s true genealogy was, it started spiraling down to be an empty concept. 

Nations are formed when a group of people identify themselves as belonging to a common genealogy and demand that they are the righteous owners of the land that they’re claiming as their nation. This formation of a country, in cases other than autocracy, could be incited through a common ancestry, language, religion or ideology. The Indian independence incited us to form this nation, the constitution sealed it. But what is it really that binds us? Religion? No, we’re supposedly a secular nation. Language? Of course not. Ancestry? Not so much. Ancestrally, Tamils are more related to Sri Lankans than they’re to Biharis. Ideology? Nope. 

So why are we still a single country? Because, TAX. The centre can tax the whole country which is a HUMUNGOUS sum of money considering our ever-growing population. The governments have generation after generation fooled us using ‘nationalism’ while they eat our hard-earned tax. It is our money, it is our time and energy. I have agreed through the constitution to pay taxes along with my fellow people for a service, a service called the government. The only responsibility of this service is to improve the life of it’s people. But what it has become is a handful of pigs gobbling up the tax collected from a BILLION people. With this enormous sum of money comes enormous  power, the power to buy anything and everything. The power to buy the media. The power to cause so much toxic language pollution (fake news) that none of us realize what the real problems are. The power to stagnate education and hence reason. The pigs took away education from us, the worst thing that could be done as a government, it’s worse than physically crippling one. 

When we are given statistics like India's GDP is the sixth highest, it hides a lot of important information. Per capita is what matters. We're not supposed compare an economy of 1.3 Billion to 82 million of Germany or 127 million of Japan. There is absolutely nothing to be proud of. It's fallacious, it's a pseudo-statistic. The population of Bihar and UP combined is a 300 million. Yet we're constantly fooled by similar statistics that adds to our epidemic complacency that we're a growing nation. Science, technology, economy, healthcare, sports everywhere the statistics can fool us if we see us as just one country. 

Democracy is naive. A susceptible and complacent peon has the same weightage of vote as a well-learned professor who really cares for the country and contributes 10000% more towards its economy. When the quality of the population is extremely low because of the enormous population and lack of education, votes can be bought easily because they do not have to ability to reason for themselves, a day’s wage and meal is itself an accomplishment for most. Millions of people are swayed for vote by throwing one-time food and liquor, fake promises and fake news all because the pigs never let them get educated and forcibly put them in such a situation for their own gains to power. 

I’m no anti-national. National and anti-national don’t even mean anything if one digs deeper. They’re simply terms used by people for selfish reasons to stamp a person and reduce the details of what he/she says to merely ‘national’ or ‘anti-national’. We should simply stop using these terms and use a more productive terminology to label and discuss ideas. Everything is in the details, this is not about clickbait and headlines, these are supremely complex and deep problems that cannot be discussed and solved if we use crass terminology. The pigs are chauvinists and language polluters, they don’t care, they don’t even know, they will say anything to get media’s attention and media’s attention is more votes. What we need is a radical ideological revolution to give meaning to this beautiful ‘nation’. We should evolve to form a confederacy of countries based on a modern yet moral ideology. ",4

Is Indian Meteorological Department really incompetent?,47,6z9gmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6z9gmn/is_indian_meteorological_department_really/,15,1505092312.0,"This is an excerpt from D Sivananda Pai's (Head of climate prediction at IMD) interview published in Indian Express.
[Link](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/meteorological-predictions-are-not-perfect-we-never-claim-that-it-is-a-science-we-do-our-best-d-sivananda-pai-imd/) 


**On unreliable forecasts from IMD**
>- I admit that meteorological predictions are not perfect. We never claim that we are 100 per cent right. It is a science and we do the best we can. 
- Rainfall is never equally distributed throughout the city. So, generally, forecasting the exact rainfall value over a particular location is not possible. For eg. in case of recent rains in Mumbai, the regional variation was so high that within the city itself, Dharavi recorded 56 cm of rainfall, Santacruz 33 cm and Colaba about 10 cm 
- Nature is not deterministic. It is a chaotic system. A high degree of randomness prevails and even the best of models cannot eliminate this uncertainty.
- Nature does not behave in the same manner every time, there will still be some discrepancy between the model result and actual event. We need to be aware of 
 these inherent limitations.


**On comparison with more accurate forecasts in other countries**
>- I would say it is only partially correct. We give very accurate forecasts for cyclones. Other countries have more accurate forecasts over short-range, day-to-day variation, because of radar coverage and lesser uncertainties in weather systems. However, our extended range and seasonal forecasts are much better than them.
- There is a difference in weather events in other countries and India. England lies in an extra-tropical region. Their weather is dictated by frontal systems which are much more stable and predictable. India, on the other hand, is in the tropical belt. There is more randomness in weather events.
- In the US or Europe, their entire area is tracked by radars. It gives them better short-range forecasts. We don’t have radars that  continuously monitor every region because it wasn’t considered very cost-effective. We need 30-40 more Doppler Radars. We are in the process of getting them. Once we have more radars, our short-range forecasts will also improve. But our cyclone forecast is one of the best in the world. 


**On the availability of best technology**
>- We now have a very good computer system, which will be further upgraded this December. We have very good weather models. Many of our IMD officials are in charge of technical committees at the WMO. I am myself chairing a technical team at the WMO which provides regional climate outlook. If you are not the best, you would not be picked up for these jobs. 
- India is, and now it is globally acknowledged, at the same level as developed countries in weather forecasting.
- There are many other issues that apply to meteorology in general like our data-collecting capability over oceans is not very good. Even on land, it is difficult to get data from certain areas such as Afghanistan


**IMD on world front**
>- People in the WMO take India as the natural leader in meteorology in this part of the world. Our scientists are very well respected.
- India, being the natural leader, was asked not just to prepare forecasts for South Asia but also to train other countries in the region.

[NP] Indians who think 'humanities are dumb' - how much of Humanities Literature have you actually read?,28,642h30,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/642h30/np_indians_who_think_humanities_are_dumb_how_much/,52,1491621172.0,"I'm genuinely curious about this because I have seen this view repeated in too many places. I've always thought the Physical Sciences were just a field that required long, mindless hours of practising formulas, so I avoided this mindless drudgery to focus on greater ideas, greater thoughts of Human Existential Dilemma. But I found my impressions of physical sciences was wrong. There is a lot of intellect that is required for the theoretical sciences - especially when I began to learn about the transitions from Newtonian to Einsteinian to Quantum Mechanical views of the world.

I realised that Science requires a lot of depth of thought, imagination and leaps of logic, much like Philosophy and especially, metaphysical thought. To be a great Scientist, one needs to be more than just a mindless ratte-baaz. My respect for scientists has grown.

This understanding has come to me after developing an interest for 'Science'. 

My question is: there is a particular stereotype about Indians being service providers to the world, we are hardly ever recognised as idea producers. I believe that to create great ideas, you need a great mind. The ideal for this is someone like Da Vinci, or even Steve Jobs. These are the kind of people who straddle worlds between technology and art. I find that Indian 'technologists' are very uni-dimensional. I'm hardly ever intrigued by ideas presented by a Nandan Nilekani for example, as opposed to a Shashi Tharoor. Indians, of course, are very intelligent and hard workers. I would hope though that we started engaging with different, compartmentalised streams too - to grow, to become greater. We need to engage beyond disciplinary boundaries because all they do is reduce us into commercial products who provide the corporate machine with rats for the race. To be Entrepreneurs, idea makers, we need to develop a wider, deeper intellect.

I'm curious: what do you think about my views?",4
"Hi, /r/India! TRAI wants to know how we can hold telecom operators accountable for mobile data speeds. Here's how you can make your voice heard.",220,6esgm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6esgm8/hi_rindia_trai_wants_to_know_how_we_can_hold/,11,1496409982.0,"Firstly, here is the consultation paper: [Consultation Paper on Data Speed Under Wireless Broadband Plans](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf) [PDF]

###**What is this?**

TRAI wants to know **how mobile Internet providers should be held more accountable for the data speeds they advertise.** Mobile data speeds are much more variable and unpredictable than fixed-line broadband connections, so TRAI is looking at whether they should make a 'label' from telcos mandatory that specifies what kind of speeds customers should expect from their connections. TRAI also wants to know what kind of tech they can use to *measure* how fast telcos' connections actually are for their subscribers.

###**Sounds great! How do I send in my ideas?**

First of all, take a deep breath. Telcos are going to have a really long answer to this consultation, and their lobbying will be polished and elaborate -- they do **not want to be regulated.** If you are a concerned citizen, you need to make your voice *heard*, not just *counted.*

Telecom consultation filings are not rocket science. You can send in a good and insightful response, and it won't take you more than an hour or two. Remember, your response **will be read**, and this TRAI administration leans towards consumers. 

**Read the consultation paper.** [Here's the link again](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf). Read it fully, it's only 30 pages long, and gives you enough context and information to be able to answer the questions.

**Draft a response.** This should not take you very long. You have a month to send a response in, so just spend a couple days collating all the points you want to mention in your response, order them under subheads, and work them into your answers to each question.

Make a PDF or Word Document of your response and email it to **kapilhanda@trai.gov.in**.

###**Cool! What's the deadline?**

The deadline is **29th June**. You can email TRAI and ask them to extend this deadline if you feel that this time is not adequate, and they usually do extend deadlines upon request. But try and get in on this right as telcos do, because TRAI may read responses as and when they ge them.

The deadline for **counter-comments**, which is an ***equally important stage***, if not more, where you have to counter arguments made by other responders, is **13th July**. 

###**What are the questions?**

Here are the questions TRAI wants you to answer. (emphasis all mine; text slightly edited for clarity). If you feel like you don't know the context for some of these questions, check the consultation paper; it will probably answer any questions you might have about the existing regulatory framework that telcos face.

Q1: Is the information on wireless broadband [mobile internet] speeds currently available to consumers *transparent enough* to help them make informed choices?

Q2: If it is difficult [for telcos] to commit to a minimum download speed, then could an
average speed be specified by service providers? What should
be the parameters for calculating this average speed?

Q3: What changes can be brought about to the *existing framework* on
wireless broadband tariff plans to encourage better transparency
and comparison between plans offered by different service
providers?

Q4: Is there a need to *include or delete* any of the *QoS parameters*
and/or revise any of the benchmarks currently stipulated in the
Regulations?

Q5: Should disclosure of *average network performance* over a period
of time or at peak times including through broadband facts/labels
be made *mandatory*?

Q6: Should standard application/websites be identified for mandating
comparable disclosures about network speeds?

Q7: What are the products/technologies that can be used to measure
actual end-user experience on mobile broadband networks? At
what level should the measurements take place (e.g., on the 
device, network node)?

Q8: *Are there any legal, security, privacy or data sensitivity issues
with collecting device level data?*

a) If so, how can these issues be addressed?  
b) Do these issues create a challenge for the adoption of any
measurement tools?

Q9: What measures can be taken to *increase awareness among
consumers* about wireless broadband speeds, availability of
various technological tools to monitor them and any potential
concerns that may arise in the process?

Q10: Any other issue related to the matter of Consultation.

Remember, if there's something that you think this consultation paper missed out on, include it in response to question 10.",4
Spoiler Alert! Only for people who have watched it or don't care if they ever watch it - My Analytical Review of the movie Dunkirk.,26,719nda,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/719nda/spoiler_alert_only_for_people_who_have_watched_it/,12,1505923936.0,"While Inception and interstellar, though fascinating, were unrealistic and defied all rules of science, mathematics and common sense, Dunkirk, is Christopher Nolan's best movie yet. I recently watched it and I wanted to key my thoughts down and see what else people may have gleaned from the movie. I gleaned something that pertains to India-China standoff(s) among other things.

So, basically, Dunkirk is about 400,000 men, British and French, stranded in enemy territory in WW2. With the enemy closing in from all sides, the British are waiting for rescue to get back to Britain which is visible across the channel from Dunkirk Situated in France. That's basically it. However, the movie spans on much more and the unique Nolan mind-wrangling makes it more interesting than the simple premise stated above.

The movie begins with a staggered timeline. It follows the pilots of the Spitfires over a 40-minute long journey to Dunkirk while it follows the struggle of the 3 soldiers with the ships and in water in trying to escape from the beach for days. It even ends with a staggered timeline following the seamen and soldiers days after the incident while following the pilot only minutes after the climax. IMO, apart from trying to capture the chaos of war, this reflects on two things - 1. The British Navy and Army have existed for hundreds of years while airforce is relatively new. It may also be symbolic of the fact that there are nations that have existed forever and they will continue to exist forever even in the face of new ones that may come up. 2. The advent of new technology makes us dependent on it. We see how dive bombers keep killing thousands and sinking rescue destroyers and the soldiers keep asking ""where is the airforce?"".

Next, it focuses on the butterfly effect. Farrier's fuel gauge is broken and he is given the choice to turn back but he chooses to stay the course and ends up saving the entire rescue. If he had just chosen to turn back, all the planes he shot down wouldn't have been shot and the rescue may not have taken place or been as effective.       
Similarly, Tommy tagged ""Gibson"" along who ends up saving their lives by opening the door on the ship sinking because of the torpedo. 

We also see that the massive and powerful destroyers are bombed by the enemy and are unable to rescue the stranded soldiers, a feat that is accomplished by civilian boats. This, to me, highlights the fact that it is not the military might of a country but the spirit of its people that wins wars - something Winston Churchill had alluded to in one of his addresses to the nation. Also, it tries to present that one should not underestimate small nations (like Britain represented by small boats) because they may accomplish feats that big nations (represented by the destroyers) may not be able to achieve. There is also another moment where the soldiers ask the civilians of the Moonstone saying ""we let you down, didn't we?"" reiterating the fact that how the military may have let the country down but the country did not let its soldiers down. We also see the spirit of the people when we see Dawson and his son heading fearlessly towards Dunkirk to rescue the stranded soldiers but the Shivering soldier, Fortis leader, is afraid to go back and many times tries to force them to change course. However, they hold steady, determined to complete the mission. We also see that civilians trust themselves to be more quick and effective than the military and all the bureaucratic red tape when Dawson doesn't wait for the navy but sets off on his own to do the exact same thing he was requisitioned for. 
 *And this is the part of the movie where I would like to mention how it relates to India. The fact that the strength of the military isn't everything in the war, the spirit of the nation matters more is why India should never cower before China. They may have better machines, we have better people.*

Next, there are elements of poetic justice in the movie. We see that Tommy, who stands up for ""Gibson"" in the Dutch boat is saved by the Moonstone but the Highlander who wants to sacrifice ""Gibson"" because of him being French and then Tommy who is not a member of the Highland regiment is forced to come up for air and is burnt alive - or poetically speaking burns in hell. Then again, Alex, who is pragmatic vs Tommy who is more moralistic in comparison face resolution of guilt at different times. While Tommy, who is more considerate and observant (remember he is the one who talks about the ""grouping"" of bullet holes), notices that the man handing out blankets on the train station is blind. When the old guy says, well done, he asks him ""But all I did was survive"", the old guy says "" That's enough"". His guilt and burden is resolved and he can peacefully sleep on the train. Alex, on the other hand, because of his superficial nature, burning guilt and less regard for others, thinks that the guy is so ashamed of them that he can't even look them in the eyes. He faces this guilt all night, even reads hatred from the people in the headlines of the newspaper and cannot look at the people until he sees that they are applauding them not spitting in their faces. This reflects on how we see in the world a lot of what we are and what we feel inside. It also touches upon the fact that ultimately, the soldiers' guilt and burden can only be lessened by the country and they feel as successful as the nation makes them feel. Their victory is not at the fronts but in the eyes of the nation and they always want validation from it. We also see this when Peter tells the Fortis leader that George will be okay even though he is dead. It suggests that it is a sort of duty of the civilians to grant clemency to the soldiers to relieve them of their burden.

Also, the movie seems to sort of touch on the fact that how one ""good soul"" is worth more than many average souls. It seems like good people keep taking the place of many average people in the movie. eg, ""Gibson"" saves Tommy, Alex, and others from drowning but ends up drowning himself. ""Farrier"" saves the 300,000 British soldiers on the beach from the dive bombers and the army that has broken through the perimeter but ends up being taken hostage by the Germans himself. It always seems like they take the place of many good people and God/ Heaven/Universe is content to exchange their one soul for the souls of many. Also, this shows how miracles don't just happen. Every miracle has a cost, the life of someone else, someone else's sacrifice for someone else's gain.

Then there is a glorification of war and our duty towards glorifying it. How young men are encouraged to die in futility many times in the name of war. We see this aboard the Moonstone as Dawson, Peter, and George set sail to rescue the stranded men. While Dawson and Peter save many men and fulfill an important mission, George only joins them because he wants to be a hero in the war zone and wants his photograph in the paper. He is just observing and trying to make himself useful but ends up dying before he could actually do something substantial. Again, the futile deaths and suffering in the war is highlighted when the man trying to escape to the destroyer gets caught between the ferry and the destroyer and ends up with crushed legs. Also, there is a difference in how Dawson and Peter look at the Shivering Soldier, the leader of Fortis air trio. While Dawson tries to understand his pain and looks at him as a human, Peter looks at him as a coward for not wanting to die in the war. In the end, however, we see how the experience changes Peter, who gives clemency to Fortis Leader by lying to him by saying that George will be fine. We see how Dawson approves of this. Again, a reflection on how war changes people and a reflection on our duty towards the soldiers and not just their duty towards the nation. We also see the irony of Dawson sympathizing with the plight of the Shivering soldier who is afraid to go into war, kills George and is trying to prevent Dawson from rescuing soldiers when Dawson's own son died in the war. We can see the effects of war on people again when the camera shows Peter and Tommy, two people of almost the same age but one weighed down by the horrors of war and the other a lad just coming to terms with the disillusionment of what war is.      
We also see that it is the civilians who make the heroes what they are. Heroes are formed when the nation accepts them to be so. We see that when Peter and Dawson get George's picture printed in the newspaper and only then Peter gains satisfaction. This reflects on that every life lost in the battle is treated with respect irrespective of circumstances for the satisfaction of the loved ones that their children/siblings/spouse did not make the ultimate sacrifice in vain, even when so many wars are futile.

Then there is the contrast in the thinking of people in accordance with their ranks and situations. The soldiers are fighting on the Dutch boat and want to sacrifice the French and then the non-Highlanders to survive. On the other hand, the French ""Gibson"" saves Tommy and Alex not once but twice, once by opening the door and the second time by slipping the rope from the boat. We also see this discord when the French soldier asks Tommy to move along from the French line at the beach in the beginning of the movie. The admiral, on the other hand, wants to stay back to help the Fench at the end of the movie. We have seen earlier in the movie admiral saying ""we should get our army back for the next battle which will happen in Britain"" but he seems dejected when Britain seems dejected when Britain seems to hold off on destroyers saving them for the next battle. Again we see how the military can let its own people down and the civilians never do. Another example is when the Highlanders on the boat refuse to let Tommy and Alex on but ""Gibson"" slips them a rope. We also see this spirit again when the civilians hail the arrival of the soldiers after all they have done is survived.On the other hand, ranks may not really mean much as we see that Farrier ends up saving the day while the Fortis Leader is a trembling mess and ends up killing a civilian. In all of this, the movie tries to highlight that soldiers, too, are just ordinary men doing their best to survive extraordinarily stressful events one minute and one event at a time.

It also focuses on how the efforts of so many remain unsung in the war. Like when soldiers accuse Collins of not being there for them aka airforce not doing enough for them at the station while Dawson reassures them they know you were there for them. Again, how the country never lets its soldiers down and how the nation's validation is important for the soldiers fighting for it.

Then there is the ending. The fact that Farrier keeps gliding even after the last drops of fuel have run out captures the spirit of the soldiers and the nation to fight until its last breath. The fact that even when dying it manages to save thousands of people by shooting down the last plane shows that even if a soldier or country is going down, it can save other people and countries and give them the miracle of living on. Of how Farrier, instead of just ejecting from the plane, lands it down and gives it a proper patriotic send-off by burning it. Which goes to show how the people of a country don't just jump off from it when it goes down, they respect it to the end even if it is burning due to war, internal struggles, whatever. It also reflects on the fact that though the main player may have gone down (Farrier) the many people who survived would, because of him, carry on the legacy which lines up with the ending of the movie which says that even if Britain went down, its colonies abroad would carry on their legacy. ( I have some words regarding that legacy of colonies but that is not the point of the movie). And lastly they show the Plane in flames but its structure still stands respectfully because of a good person like Farrier which showcases how the entire Europe burned in the World Wars (of their own making) but the spirit and the structure of Europe survived it due to the ""good men."" Again, a reflection on how the respect for a country is determined by the character of its people.

In the entire movie the themes that are common. Wars are not won by armies but by the spirit of the people. Armies may let countries down, but the country never lets it down. Poetic justice finds its way. How war changes people and the duty of the citizens to laud the soldiers who choose to fight regardless of everything.

I also appreciated small things that were incorporated. eg. at the beginning when the dive bombers bomb the beach when the explosions are far away, the sound is delayed from the visual of the explosion but when the explosions come near, the delay decreases. Something that is correct according to the laws of physics but I have never seen depicted in movies and have commented on in my head while watching the movies in the past. Then, how Tommy meets Gibson while attending nature's call. It's just wrenching that he just survived an attack on his life and then he just goes to attend his business. It is disturbing that attacks on the lives are just as routine to the soldiers as reading a newspaper is to us and the movie captures this well. Then when dive bombers throw bombs over a bridge, Tommy covers his ears. It's not the depiction of a war hero like in many other movies, its the true depiction of what soldiers are, just humans who chose to go to war and have to face horrible situations. It is also depicted with Farrier when he shows perplexion and uncertainty many times. I really liked that there was a Dutch merchant sailor, out of nowhere, he just came to help these guys. The fact that none of the army men knew anything about the tides anywhere. The fact that presence of mind helps these people more than any crazy stunts or machine guns or brawn - like when Tommy decides to take the stretcher to get aboard the ship, when Farrier keeps track of fuel by asking Collins. The incident when the Dutch doesn't understand ""ballast"" and has to be told ""weight"". Just little things that were quite meticulous.

That's all that I can put together right now. I shall add more when I think of something else I forgot to jot down or someone brings up a good point. Let me know what you gleaned from it.",4

Need help with depression and anger.,8,7yz12m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yz12m/need_help_with_depression_and_anger/,3,1519186110.0,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.

HRD Ministry seeks your views/suggestions/comments for creating 20 World class institutions by 28 Oct. Lets's do our part r/india.,135,56kz6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/56kz6z/hrd_ministry_seeks_your_viewssuggestionscomments/,52,1476020233.0,"http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Public%20Consultation%20Document.pdf

Since most people are not reading the draft policy and trying to turn this post into how the GoI controls premier education and how bad the condition is. Look it's not that we aren't aware of it, we all know the reality but I hoped that this post will be about solutions, not cribbing about problems. Anyway here is the gist of drafted policy:

**Objective:**

To provide an **enabling regulatory architecture** to **ten public and ten private** Higher Educational Institutions to emerge as world-class Teaching and Research Institutions. (Right now we have way too many policy restriction on universities, they need approval for almost everything from UGC).

**What the hell do they mean by enabling regulatory architecture :**

These draft Guidelines & Regulations contain eligibility criteria, selection procedure, other Regulatory aspects, monitoring & evaluation, etc for World Class Institutions. These have been drafted considering the characteristics of a institutions which are world class which includes exceptionally high quality teaching and research standards preferably in multi-disciplinary areas; a significant proportion of international and meritorious students; a reasonably good proportion of qualified faculty from high-ranked universities worldwide, transparent and need-blind system to ensure intake of meritorious students; adequate financial assistance to students; a healthy faculty student ratio; well-equipped facilities for teaching, research, administration and student-life; adequate infrastructure for operations and expansion; autonomous governance structures; financial soundness through either a large corpus fund or recourse to public funding, as the case may be and, teaching and research collaborations with reputed global universities. 

The draft Guidelines & Regulations also provides for admission procedure, fixing appropriate fee structures pursuant to internal policies, appointment of faculty, collaboration with foreign higher educational institutions, and design and offer courses in existing programmes and new areas. **Additionally, these institutions shall have complete financial autonomy to spend the resources raised and allocated.**

**Expectation from World class institution:**

1.	It should preferably be multi-disciplinary and have both teaching and research focus of an exceptionally high quality. Apart from the regular courses, it should also offer various inter-disciplinary courses, including in areas of emerging technology and interest as well as those of relevance to the development concerns of countries like India. 

2.	It should have a good proportion of foreign or foreign qualified faculty. There should be a reasonably good mix of domestic and foreign students. There should be a transparent merit based selection in admissions, so that the focus remains on getting meritorious students.                          


3.	There should be laboratory facilities that do cutting-edge scientific research for those Institutions engaged in scientific research. In case of humanities and social science and other interdisciplinary areas, the faculty should be engaged in research and field work in frontier areas using the latest methodologies. 

4.	It should have student amenities comparable with that of globally reputed institutions. It should have a student enrolment of at least twenty thousand students in a period of fifteen years. The faculty student ratio should not be less than 1:10 after three years of declaration as a World Class Institution. 

5.	It should come in top five hundred of any of the world renowned ranking frameworks (such as the Times Higher Education World University Rankings or QS or Shanghai’s Jiao Tong University) in the first ten years of setting up or being declared as World Class Institution. 

**Financial assistance to WCI:**

The assistance would be up to an amount of Rupees five hundred Crore to each Institution in a span of five years from 2016-17 to 2020-21. The annual release would be dependent on the institution achieving the financial and physical outcomes laid down in its implementation plan. However, if any Institution shows capacity to absorb the funds earlier and is able to give the expected outcomes, an accelerated pace of funding would also be allowed. The funding under these guidelines would be in addition to the existing funding to which they are entitled to.

Rest pages talks about guidelines for institutions and their eligibility criteria.",4

Let me start by sharing my educational and work background

* B.E in Civil engineering with 8.7 CGPA
* 3 years (1 year in UK) work experience in Indian IT firm - working in largest telecommunication firm as a analyst/developer

I am fairly strong in back-end (pl/sql) and basic programming concepts (worked with C, C++) and unix scripting and had a little time with VBA, Java, Javascript.
Though I am trying to learn new concepts/technologies I can't find the time for it with the day to day task and since the recent UK visa policy made 
the immigrants lot harder to enter UK,
I thought why not take a break and give a chance at full time masters(in computer science/data analytics) with the money I saved from onsite assignment. 
So with little research and help from friends who is doing masters abroad I finally decided germany would be the right place considering the next to nothing tuition fee.

Here's my questions

* is Germany the right pick or do you have any other suggestion (considering 0 tuition fees)
* Would my bachelor degree make it any difficult getting a seat in uni and later in finding work after the study
* Would I be doing my career a real harm (given that I am good at whatever I am doing right now) and lose all my savings if I don't find a job after study
* How are the job opportunities looking now in Telecom IT sector for a non EU national
* List of Universities with CS/Data analytics course in English :) - I will research on this later but would like to know your suggestions if any

Over the past few years, I have become very jaded with computer science and engineering. Everytime I sit down to code for a job or assignment it feels like a meaningless task to me.  As a result, I find it tedious and I am not able to put in any effort that amounts to original work or learning. Computers have become boring to me! Moreover, I have developed cervical pain and think that I cant continue a career that requires me to sit in front of the computer all the time.

On the other hand, I have become more and more interested in the wider currents of the world covered in the social sciences like political economy or philosophy. Issues such as the impacts of technology, social organisation, policy,etc seem more important to me than the next great programming language or the iphone.

I am also interested in moving out of the country for reasons mentioned here - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/77z7a8/which_country_for_masters_and_further_job/

[Serious] Seeking advice from r/India since most other places have foreigners who can not give proper answer,48,5rq4gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5rq4gj/serious_seeking_advice_from_rindia_since_most/,26,1486104761.0,"Hello,

I am someone who wanted to do research for a living, physics specifically, but because of various circumstances was forced to do a bachelors degree in electronics and communications engineering in India. I had previously been in a markedly Western system and could not cope but was forced to finish the degree anyway. It took me 7 years to finish with reappear papers piling up over and over again and I am now 25 years old with a low undergraduate gpa (6.122/10). I am still interested in research but I don't know where to go now. I was hoping to do research in physics (and I still am) but after some discussions I may have to change things up a bit.

I've discussed a bit about what I've heard from reddit with my parents. As far as things go financially, I am pretty dependent on them. Now from the way the discussion went down last time, I get the feeling that they might be getting impatient what with me taking so long on my bachelor's already and from what they are letting on, I should either get into a program already or get a job soon. No preparation for exams or anything unless it is going to take 2-3 months or less. I don't know if that is enough time even if I were to study night and day. Besides, shouldn't I gain conceptual/research knowledge?

From the options I have gotten from Reddit, it basically boils down to mostly getting an MSc. I'd rather avoid doing it in India mostly because I am fed up with the educational system. People just learn how to parrot the textbook instead of actually becoming skilled in their chosen field but that may not be an option because of what I did. I pretty much just followed the curriculum. No extra curriculars/research experiences. Any practical laboratory work listed in my transcripts is pretty much on paper too. I mean it's not like I haven't handled a soldering rod, some circuitry, CROs and other small stuff but, then again, who hasn't? One redditor mentioned that because of this it may be easier to do MSc in India first, get research experience and attempting post baccalaureate courses to beef up my resume, then going abroad but as mentioned before, there is the issue of what my parents will and will not allow.

The problem comes due to the intervening periods. It doesn't help that my parents despite trying to act progressive are still limited by traditional thinking. I can't exactly blame them what with money being a relatively limited resource in our family and time passing by but that is not exactly helping with my long term plans. Due to this, theoretically, I cannot take the time off to prepare for exams for the universities such as JNU's physics MSc entrance exam or something nor will I be able to work on the post baccalaureate courses since they will take time AND money. Practically, I would probably have to work to find a job and as long as I don't find a job, I would keep preparing for the exams and what not but then I have to juggle that with trying to keep up with the knowledge required for the job that they will obviously test, if not outright rejecting me based on my grades, in some prelim exam and/or the interview. That or get a clerical job but I don't know if even that is possible because of the burgeoning population.

Now my first question to you guys is if some of the following fields might be easier to pursue research in. They may be somewhat related to both my bachelor's field as well as physics and I do have interest in them. I am not asking you guys to advise me about any of them but I am putting this out in case any of you know if it would be easier for me to go into research currently in any of those fields. Anyway, the fields are:

1. Quantum information science (computing, information theory, etc.) - Our field did involve conventional computing and information theory

2. Quantum devices/electronics, though I don't really much like the sound of this. I didn't realize there was a particular distinction between conventional electronics and quantum electronics. To my knowledge, standard electronics are based on our understanding of QM phenomena.

3. Photonics - Study of optical phenomena and derivative technologies such as optical waveguides, splitters, couplers, etc., was also focused on somewhat in my field

4. Photovoltaics/Renewable Energy Research in general - Photovoltaics is probably more the focus here. I put the second part there to emphasize my intention with research in it as well as tangential research interests.

5. Condensed Matter physics. This is more general than electronics so I don't expect it to be easier but just in case...

6. Physics of computers/information - not sure about this since it seems like it could fall into information theory

7. Dynamic systems theory (control theory, chaos theory, quantum chaos, etc.)/Study of Complex Systems - Our branch did have a lot to do with (mathematically) modelling various systems in many different ways, observing the effect of various inputs and feedbacks on the outputs.

My second question to everybody is, how would I accomodate my constraints, financial constraints being of particular note? Basically, I have to get into a program but seeing as that may be very unlikely, I may have to get a job instead. But I don't know if I can get anything other than a sub par clerical job with my degree and grades and I am not sure that would help me further my long term plans. To sum up, I am really confused about the next step to take. Please advise.",4

Kota District Collector's letter to the parents of IIT aspirants [NP],185,4i91ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4i91ig/kota_district_collectors_letter_to_the_parents_of/,40,1462632239.0,"Dear Parents,

On behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.

My humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.

It is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.

It is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.

When parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.

Good career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.

There is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one’s child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.

However, I think we all agree that the world too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.

Art, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.

Many of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.

Well, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.

It is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.

Even if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.

However, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child… Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.

I consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

Am I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?

I am sorry. Answer is No… They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

A Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children… Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.

Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth. Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like. One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste. Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents. Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.

All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do.

As they say “Tip of the Iceberg” reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.

Many Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don’t mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for. That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts… your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness.

In return, what the child got was threats of performing still better…psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family. comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors…could be anyone) sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child’ s performance.

We need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times. So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit. I need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them. So the question I tend to hear from you is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways? Not necessarily.

Well let us try to see what all good things they resisted… Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.

Child actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly. Moreover, there is one thing which is certain… Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so..Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so.

They tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful…In case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you.

It may appear strange and extremely annoying… But there is a possibility of your child not liking you… This comes in many forms and shades. Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have…) etc.

So, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?

Answer again is a big No.. Your child does not dislike you… I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo…

Children are parents’ responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so… Parents really think good for their children’s future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good… what is successful… what is the best thing… Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of…

We all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.

I am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in “Right Child Care Practices” and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.

Creating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.
Understanding the needs of the children. There are two extremes in this case…Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise “Your” dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care… Both of them definitely do not work.

Take time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times…Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher.

Allow the child “to be” on his own terms and here I mean especially the child’s engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative. Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.

Spend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the timeâ€¦. It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child. Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him. We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.

Just a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise “Your Dreams” at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises “His/Her” Dreams?

I could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.

Nothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others. Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you.

Be the Best Parent in the World!!!!
I am sure there is no competition there

* From reading testimonials, I get the feeling that it's a high pressure, data entry kind of job. How accurate is this?

* Do you have any AAPC certificates? Are they needed for entry level? I'm a Mechanical graduate. Would it help if I got a CPC? How hard is the exam?

* Would you recommend the job?

I'm a Canadian with big interest in globalized prosperity. I'm a /r/futurology moderator, and all technological trends are pointing to a great future that is already beginning to take hold. As you know, Artificial Intelligence has been exploding lately, and is no longer science fiction. They're beginning to sift through massive swaths of computational data, and with evolving sensory upgrades such as natural language processing and machine vision, they'll be gathering data on ourselves. With the sharing and reputation economy unraveling, I think its very important for people to start thinking and acting more rationally and compassionately. The corruption going on in your government will begin being chipped away, and I think the earlier you guys realize this, the better. So I'd like to take this moment to open up a dialogue so that more people can become aware of how technology is going to play into the ongoing evolution of our growing interconnected society.  ",4
26 M UK -> India (Delhi or otherwise) (Crosspost from IWantOut),14,6scq8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6scq8i/26_m_uk_india_delhi_or_otherwise_crosspost_from/,2,1502218619.0,"Hi all, I posted this in IWantOut, but was encouraged to post it in here to get a more specific response:

>Currently living in UK, with my long-term (Indian) partner living in Delhi. We've resolved to live together by the end of next year, and considering the uncertainty in the UK climate at the moment, a big plan is for me to move to India, if at least for a few years.

>As I understand it, the chance of getting an entry-level job that pays the required amount (16 lakh rupees/ $25,000/ £19,200) for a work visa is astronomically low, so I need to look at job areas exempt from this or other means of getting a visa. We could also get married and I could apply for an X-visa, and whilst marriage is on the cards, and eventually I will apply for an OCI card, the X-visa doesn't let you work, and so short-term isn't much use above letting me stay there whilst I look for work.

>I'm a science PhD student (marine biology), and so can look at jobs in science there, but a lot of the science/ technology jobs are way out of my field, and I'm happy to leave science and do something else. Something I've been thinking long about is working for the British High Commission in some capacity (which is exempt from the work-visa salary requirements), or as a branch between UK and Indian operations in multinational companies. Does anyone have any experience with making this move, or something similar, and have any advice on how to proceed with it? Or any expats in India that found a job in a completely unrelated field and are having a roaring success with it?

"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results",47,4gbzmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gbzmf/npengineering_education_in_india_hot_intake_cold/,18,1461592127.0,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

"IMO: To those in r/india who think “Statue of Unity” cannot be justified, here is my opinion. feel free to provide counter-arguments..",33,2hhqos,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2hhqos/imo_to_those_in_rindia_who_think_statue_of_unity/,126,1411727916.0,"Here is what i think of it. you can provide your opinion.. 

1)	Justifying that MOM was 1/4th of the projected cost of “statue of unity” is wrong because MOM’s cost was low not because of the budget cuts, but because of cheap technology in India, because we can do it.  Although I do think ISRO should be getting more from the government, it doesn’t mean that money should come from statue of unity.

2)      Remember, this project is mostly being carried out by Gujarat govt. So if you're thinking the tax money of people outside Gujarat will be used, it won't. 

3)	Statue of Unity is not just a simple stuatue. First it will be the tallest statue in the world .Then, there will be a lot of things inside the statue. This will include elevators to go to the top of the statue where there’ll be an panaromic observation deck at about the head of the statue. It’ll also include a museum and small theatre that depicts the history of India. Alongside, there’ll be laser show, underwater aquarium, ferry services, research center, restaurants and stuff. Please check at their website.

Here's a link: http://www.statueofunity.in/statue-of-unity-project-features.html

4) the statue will be located almost at the meeting point of gujarat, maharashtra and madhya pradesh.. hence, increasing local tourism.. 

5)	Remember, this project will be mostly financed by Gujarat. Gujarat has decent manufacturing, decent agriculture, but has a very small share of India’s tourism sector. Modi has been trying to boost tourism in Gujarat for a while with bringing in Amitabh Bachchan for advertisements. But they know this statue will significantly improve the tourism to Gujarat. 

6) You can't just spend all the money on one thing, and leave the other thing aside. Everything has to grow together, so tourism and science also has to grow together. If you think the statue is not going to boost tourism, then think about this:

these were all built many decades ago when these countries where at the stage even not as developed as india is now.. and also remember, it's cheaper to make the statue now than say in 20 years, because it'll cost billions then due to much much higher gdp (even after considering inflation).. 

given the number of things that is being built, i wouldn't be surprised if the cost goes above projected cost, but i think it'll be worth it in coming years.. 

EDIT: thanks to those people who gave reasonable explanation. It was a good brainstorming exercise. ",4

India's Mass Surveillance Capabilities,12,4y8owg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4y8owg/indias_mass_surveillance_capabilities/,16,1471502765.0,"I read a post on r/worldnews about how Canadian police wanted to force citizens to hand over their passwords. This led me down a rabbit hole from where I eventually made my way to Wikipedia. Below is what I found. Turns out surveillance in India is far greater than in the US.

1.) CMS - The CMS gives India's security agencies and income tax officials centralized access to India's telecommunications network and the ability to listen in on and record mobile, landline and satellite calls and voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and read private emails, SMS and MMS, geolocate people using Mobile phone tracking, all in real time. It can also monitor posts on social media and Google searches, without any parliamentary or judicial oversight. There was not even any parliamentary talk before this was implemented.

2.) DRDO NETRA - NETRA can analyse voice traffic passing through software such as Skype, and intercept messages with keywords such as 'attack', 'bomb', 'blast' or 'kill' in real-time from the enormous number of tweets, status updates, emails, instant messaging transcripts, internet calls, blogs, forums and even images generated on the internet to obtain the desired intelligence.

3.) NATGRID - Each individual's data ranging from land records, internet logs, air and rail PNR, phone records, gun records, driving license, property records, insurance, and income tax records would be available in real time and with no oversight. Data from UIDAI is a part of NATGRID.

4.) LIM - LIM systems are used by the Indian Government to intercept records of voice, SMSs, GPRS data, details of a subscriber's application and recharge history and call detail record (CDR) and monitor Internet traffic, emails, web-browsing, Skype and any other Internet activity of Indian users. Mobile operators deploy their own LIM system which allows the government to intercept calls. These surveillance systems are under complete control of the government, and their functioning is secretive and unknown to the ISPs.

5.) UIDAI - Collects the biometric (2 iris scans, all 10 fingerprints) and demographic data of residents, store them in a centralized database, and issue a 12-digit unique identity number called Aadhaar to each resident. 

In 2013, the CBI was trying to solve the case of a rape of a schoolgirl. It approached a Goa local court saying that they had acquired some fingerprints from the scene and they could be matched with the UIDAI database. The court asked UIDAI to hand over all data of all persons in Goa to CBI. The Central Forensic Science Laboratory stated that they would have several 100,000 false positives from the 60 million Goa residents. The Supreme Court restrained the central government and the UIDAI from sharing data with any third party or agency, whether government or private, without the consent of the Aadhaar-holder in writing. However Aadhaar information is accessible under the CMS, NETRA, NATGRID and LIM.

6.) Encryption beyond 40 bits is illegal. Banks are exempt from this and can utilize 256 bit encryption. There may be plans to increase encryption allowed to 128 bits. Whatsapp was nearly banned due to the end to end encryption. In the end, there were no laws set in place for Over The Top services.

7.) BOUNDLESSINFORMANT - India is among the countries subjected to extreme NSA surveillance, more than Afghanistan, China, Russia and US. 

8.) ITA-2000 - The Indian parliament passed the Information Technology Act of 2008 with no debate, giving the government fiat power to tap all communications without a court order or a warrant.

Section 69 empowers the Central Government/State Government/ its authorized agency to intercept, monitor or decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource. Failure to comply by can result in 7 year imprisonment.

Section 66A has been used to arrest cartoonists depicting corruption, people sharing cartoons depicting politicans via email, tweeting about corruption and nepotism, positing and liking the said post on Facebook insulting politicians.

A.) In 2010, a cartoonist was arrested under Section 66A and for sedition. His cartoons depicting widespread corruption in India were considered offensive. 

B.) In 2012, a professor was arrested for sharing a cartoon of a Chief Minister and the Railway Minister. The email was sent from the email address of a housing society. The secretary of the housing society, was also arrested. They were charged under Section 66A, for defamation, for obscene gesture to a woman, and abetting a crime. 

C.) In 2012, a businessman was arrested under Section 66A. He had sent tweet accusing the son of the Finance Minister of corruption. 

D.) In 2012, a 21-year-old girl was arrested for posting a message on Facebook criticizing the shutdown in Mumbai for the funeral of politician. Another 20-year-old girl was arrested for ""liking"" the post. They were charged hurting religious sentiments, under Section 66A, and promoting enmity between classes. 

E.) In 2015, a teenage boy was arrested for making a post on Facebook insulting a politician. He was charged under Section 66A, for promoting enmity between different religions, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace, and public mischief.

Our RA&W (CIA equivalent) answers only to the PM and not the public. During its inception its powers and reach were compared to the KGB. According to Reporters Without Borders, India's C-DoT, along with NSA and GCHQ, hacked into the very heart of the internet and turned a collective resource into a weapon in the service of special interests that flout the freedom of information, freedom of expression and the right to privacy.

Due to the widespread corruption, any powerful person can gain access to and manipulate all your data. Court cases get dragged on for decades. I have zero belief that these agencies can keep all this data secure. If someone powerful decides to target me, there is nothing I can do.

Why Entrepreneurship is the best way India can solve it's problems,28,4gguue,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gguue/why_entrepreneurship_is_the_best_way_india_can/,19,1461667329.0,"Sometimes Indians don't realize how much poverty there is in India. Most of the India's population lives like a fish in the pond where fish thinks pond is the world the problems India faces is staggering only wealth creation can solve it.

Reality is, India has more people living in extreme poverty than any other country in the world in fact we have more than 30% of worlds poor people.

Overpopulation is huge problem in the country, it's already too late to control it. we are now 1.3 billion people with adding 14 million people every single year, even if fertility rates fall to 1 tomorrow we will still have 1 or 2 million adding to present 1.3 billion. For comparison India with UK which has bigger GDP, India has 1.22 billion people more than UK. We are adding population of Australia every 18 months.

India has just seen a small taste of Climate Change in last 2 years. Climate Change is gravest danger India is facing today forget in the future.

**Entrepreneurship**

To tackle Overpopulation, Climate change, Poverty there is only one thing could overcome it Entrepreneurship with clean energy technology. Only wealth creation and job creation can solve India's hard problems.

we need to change our mindset towards business, our culture needs to change towards encouraging entrepreneurs. For far too long we treated businessmen like criminals. In today's India everybody with talent can become an entrepreneur Seed funding, Angel investors, small bank loans for business are all available. we need to create 13 million jobs every year for next 20 years at least.

We need to teach every person in India about Entrepreneurship:

1. Increase 100's of top class Business schools in the country.

2. Compulsory Entrepreneurship programs in schools/colleges having Score/marks like science, maths and languages.

3. Funding programs for business ideas for MSME's, startup incubators.

4. From self- employment to employing 10-100 or even 1 lakh companies need to be taught how to manage talent.

We need to revolutionize Education and Healthcare. Introducing new technology in manufacturing and services. 

Our politicians are dumb and incompetent can't rely on them to solve our problems it's everybody in the society and private sector which will solve it. we need to get govt out of our way and demand ease of doing business.

In conclusion the best way to solve India's problems Overpopulation, climate change, Water crisis, Job creation is Entrepreneurship.",4
"There is a real lack of good science journalism in India, and this leading to poor information for those make decisions nationally. I decided to take small step to fix that. What do you think?",115,26s7s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/26s7s3/there_is_a_real_lack_of_good_science_journalism/,68,1401398081.0,"In 2011, I [conducted](http://www.criticaltwenties.in/sciencetechnology/indian-science-in-the-media) an informal survey of newspapers in India and realised that none of them cover science stories properly. A lot of their coverage relied on taking stories from international wire services. These were ok for hard science stories, but failed to help readers when it came to health, environment or even technology reporting. The [example](http://akshatrathi.com/2014/05/25/an-attempt-at-setting-the-information-balance-right/) of India's minister using dubious facts forwarded as hoax email to talk about the achievements of IITs makes the case clear.

With some friends, I formed a group to do something about it. We had lots of ideas, but most of them required a lot of money or time. However, one idea seemed attractive: building something that curates science stories on the web that relate to India. While no Indian publication does a decent job, many of them put together with some international publications generate some great stories.

So we've built [Curious Bends](http://tinyletter.com/curiousbends/), a newsletter that would curate such stories once a week. The first two editions are [here](http://tinyletter.com/curiousbends/letters/curious-bends-supersonic-rails-nutritious-millets-nuclear-bombs-and-more) and [here](http://tinyletter.com/curiousbends/letters/welcome-to-curious-bends). 

What do you think about it? Is there something we can do to improve? Do you have other ideas to improve the state of science communication in India?",4
Last Week in Parliament (July 18 to July 22),49,4uhxod,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4uhxod/last_week_in_parliament_july_18_to_july_22/,8,1469471597.0,"Hello /r/India,

I return with another four weeks of fun and frolic at the expense of our elected leaders in Parliament!

Last week, a shiny new cabinet was sworn in, a spirited discussion on Kashmir crisis (and TN Fishermen and Bangladeshi infiltrators) happened, an unknown rule was invoked unknowingly and shot down promptly and many legislations were passed.
Let’s get right into it!

#Shiny new Cabinet sworn in
___

Apart from the [53 new members](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/partymemberlist.aspx) that were sworn into Rajya Sabha, PM Modi introduced his new ministers to both houses. Prakash Javadekar replaced Smriti Irani as Minister of Human Resource Development, Vijay Goyal was given Ministry of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs & Sports and Anil Madhav Dave was sworn in as the new Minister of State (Independent charge) of Environment forest and Climate Change. A whole host of new Ministers of State were also sworn in. 

I know what you’re thinking.
 
*What’s the difference between a Cabinet Minister, Minister of State (Independent Charge) and Minister of State?* 

**Cabinet Minister**: Person is given full control over a Ministry and is eligible to attend cabinet meetings (which is the highest decision-making body of the country).

**Minister of State (Independent Charge)**: Person is given charge over a ministry, but the PMO keeps a close watch on how the ministry is functioning. These ministers are allowed to attend cabinet meetings only if the PM’s permits them to do so.

**Minister of State**: Person is given charge of a specific department or just a part of a Ministry, especially when the Ministry is large (Eg: Home, Defence or Finance). The Cabinet Minister has complete authority to decide what tasks are to be given to the MoS within the Ministry. MoS cannot attend cabinet meetings.

Casual Observation: Out of all those who were sworn in, Arjun Ram Meghwal seemed to have gotten the loudest thumps and cheers. He used to be the Chief Whip of BJP in Lok Sabha and has now been made MoS of Finance. 
Seems like he won’t be able to [bicycle to Parliament anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxyz8YASYHk).

Bonus: Here’s the [mother of all government directories](http://goidirectory.nic.in/union_categories.php?ct=E002), in case you want to find out how to reach ministries. This includes state ministries and PSUs as well. Explore away!

#Kashmir Crisis… Bangladeshi Infiltration and Tamil Fishermen
___
Discussions were held in both houses of Parliament regarding the ongoing agitation happening in the Kashmir Valley. While accusations flew thick between the Congress and BJP, regional parties like AIADMK and TMC decided to bring in their own international border issues into the discussion.

Kalyan Banerjee from TMC started speaking about infiltration from Bangladesh to West Bengal when he was interrupted by Ananth Kumar, Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers. He pointed out the Mr Banerjee was going off topic. 

[Then this happened](http://imgur.com/lWsluww)

You're killin it Khargeji!

AIADMK’s A Anwar Raajhaa (With the kind blessings of [Puruchithalaiva Amma](http://mythicalindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/weird_jayalalitha_fans.jpg)) spoke about Kashmir and then switched to talk about the problem of fishermen in Tamil Nadu who are being harassed by the Sri Lankan Navy. Raanjhaa demanded that this should be declared as a national issue as well.

#Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha Adjourns
___
The Parliament was summoned on July 18 for the monsoon session and the news was splattered with headlines like “Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha adjourns”. 

Everyone was like, “What?! Why do these politicians keep disrupting the house? Why don’t these people want to work?” 

Well, they do, but they couldn’t help it this time round.

The adjournment wasn’t because of disruptions, which is usually the cause, but for paying respects to a sitting member of Parliament who passed away. Mr Dalpat Singh Parasate of Shahdol constituency in Madhya Pradesh passed away on June 1 (#RIP). 

It’s a followed practice that in case of the death of a sitting member, Parliament will not transact any business on the first day of sitting as a mark of respect. In case an MP dies while the Parliament is in session, the house is adjourned for the following day. In the Budget session, Mr PA Sangma passed away and a similar adjournment followed. His son Conrad Sangma now occupies his seat of Tura (Meghalaya). 

The first order of business for this session in Lok Sabha was [his swearing in](http://imgur.com/vgFFwdH).

Interestingly enough, Rajya Sabha has decided in May 2016 to [curtail this practice](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajya-sabha-not-to-adjourn-for-day-if-sitting-member-dies-in-intersession-period/article8672837.ece) if the Member of Parliament passes in the interim period. The upper house will now only adjourn if an MP dies during sessions. Lok Sabha sticks to its ol’ ways.

#Thou Shalt not read out Speeches
___

While giving his speech on the Kashmir crisis, A Anwar Raajhaa of the AIADMK happened to just read it out from a few sheets of paper. He even mixed up the sheets in the middle and went off course a few times. 

Rao Indrajit Singh, MoS of Urban Development, took strong offence and got up to object. He asked the chair to stop him because there is a rule against reading out speeches in the Parliament. Well, he goofed up a little though. The person in the chair was Deputy Speaker Dr M Thambidurai. He’s from the AIADMK.

Thambidurai seemed visibly upset that the chair was being questioned and asked Singh to sit down. Although a lot of the conversation was not put on record, witnesses of LSTV will vouch about the use of the word “he’s speaking nonsense” being thrown around rather loudly. At one point, Mr Singh seemed to have given out the impression to the Deputy Speaker that he was being partial towards his own party member. The otherwise calm and gentle Thambidurai seemed to be visibly upset. 

The funny thing is that this is actually a rule. Rule 352 of the [Procedure and Conduct of Business](http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rules.html) says: 

> “A member while speaking shall not…. (xi) read a written speech except with the previous permission of the Chair.” 

So in this case, there was no clarity whether or not the prior permission of the chair was taken. If only Mr Rao Indrajit Singh quoted the rule number, he might have been able to achieve his objective. 

Mods, pliss to tweet the correct rule to him?

"Dear [R]India, lets talk about recent govt appointments at IIT/IIM/TIFR/ISI/FTII etc. Please let us discuss it rationally.

He was telling me that almost everyone including students & faculty is pissed off with the recent appointment of Mr. Gajendra as director. 

People there at large feel the man is not at all qualified for the job and students are planning for a massive protest against the high-handed appointment. There was no prior consultation was faculty member there whatsoever.

Now I did some digging and found out there seems to be pattern amongst all of the recent appointments.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

EDIT: WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated. C'mon yaar, it took me a lot efforts to dig all the relevant info, I would request you not to downvote it. Please leave this thread if you dont wanna participate.

What a shame to call Yoga as not belonging to India at the UN! This is digestion at its worst and is the greatest danger faced by Hinduism today.,1,4pfoyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4pfoyv/what_a_shame_to_call_yoga_as_not_belonging_to/,27,1466698875.0,"In a disgraceful talk to the UN, 'Sadguru' Jaggi Vasudev said,

""The significant aspect of my personal work has been to **remove all the frills of culture** that *yoga* had acquired through this millennia of transmission"". He went on to add that ""This is important in an environment where there were people of different nationalities, beliefs and ideologies"". ""Yes, it originated in India,"" he told a multinational audience of diplomats and international officials. ""As Indians we are proud of it. **But it does not belong to India.** The very fact that the UN has declared an International Yoga Day means India has gifted it to the world. It does not belong to India any more. It is very very important that yoga is brought as a proper science, not as a cultural thing, **not as an Indian thing.**""

**This IS digestion of Hinduism at it's worst.** Where one culture is removed of all its precious contributions and assimilated by another culture. See this video where Rajiv Malhotra explains this concept: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjh

By removing the health and mental benefits of Yoga and incorporating them into Christianity and Atheism and whoever else wants a piece, Jaggi Vasudev is secularizing the contributions of Hindu Saints and finally rejecting the culture and the religion that created it by calling it as a ""frill"". Sickular Gurus like Jaggi Vasudev are the worst dangers to Hinduism.  

This is nothing short of prostitution of Yoga. Harsh as it may sound, that is exactly what is happening here.

Hinduism has never been shy of sharing the fruits of its discoveries. The fruits are available for everyone to enjoy. But here Mr Vasudev is cutting the very roots and selling them. Many other technologies from India such as language itself, decimal mathematics, logic, medicine and so on have already been stolen and assimilated and then used to attack the very country that generated all these inventions by attributing all the work to the ""Greek and Roman"" civilizations. Yoga ""accidentally"" escaped such a life of slavery. But Jaggi's life work - he claims in his speech - is to correct this ""anomaly"".

Yoga has to be made into a proper science claims Jaggi. But to make something a science we only need to validate it's claims methodically. We need to make it verifiable and reproducible. You don't have to remove things and strip it of its art and beauty to do that.  

Jaggi Vasudev in another talk said that Yoga is like Gravity and no one can claim it. And he said ""if yoga is Hindu, then gravity is Christian"". But that is an out rightly silly analogy. Gravity is a force of nature. Yoga is an invention. It is a collection of techniques perfected over millennia. It does belong to the country that created and contributed to it. Just like geographic identification is given to champagne and other products like Neem, Yoga cannot be taken from its Indian origins. This is nothing short of stealing and appropriating the hard work of millions of sadhus and Rishis of this country over countless generations.

While stealing and secularizing Yoga allows Gurus like Jaggi Vasudev to make a fast buck by selling Yoga to foreign cultures, it has a detrimental long term impact on India and Hinduism.
Yoga IS Indian. Yoga IS Hindu. Everyone who has a shred of patriotism towards their motherland or their religion should OPENLY condemn such outright theft before Yoga goes the route of language, mathematics, logic and other great stolen Indian contributions.

I have seen Jaggi Vasudev's endorsement of Rajiv Malhotra’s Being Different on his site http://rajivmalhotra.com/jaggi-vasudevs-letter/. But be warned that while he gives lip service to his book, his entire work (as he claimed in his talk yesterday) is completely opposite to its cause. It is very important, I feel, that we should call his hypocrisy publicly and unambiguously. Given the limelight he has been gathering, it is a matter of extreme urgency.

The National Identity XI : The story of India’s most ambitious hawk,11,5fgv0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5fgv0a/the_national_identity_xi_the_story_of_indias_most/,3,1480425574.0,"*The Armoured Corps occupies a pedestal higher than most other Corps in armies around the world. Images of Field Marshal Rommel and his Panzer divisions scything through North Africa and Europe. 3 Cavalry and Deccan Horse laying waste to Pakistan’s famed 1 Armoured Division in the Battle of Asal Uttar and Poona Horse’s indomitable tank commanders sear the general conscience. Armoured Corps officers are akin to fighter pilots in the Air Force, they have their own tank, their own aviators, their own dungarees and a special brand of Armoured Corps chutzpah to take into battle. Everything in the regiment centers around the machine and the men who run them, and often times they become one. Naturally, Armoured Corps officers are fiercely loyal and protective of their own; and violently territorial about commanding the pride of India’s Armoured Corps — 1 Armoured Division in Patiala. This is the story of an Infantry officer who rose through the ranks to become the only Infantryman to command this famed Division, the man who gave the Armoured Corps its distinctive black uniform and who went on to lead the Indian Army into its’ most active three year phase in history and for the only time in Independent India’s history — champion military activism.*

The South Block is a long way away from Madras — but a rare combination of ego, erudition, wits and Machiavellian maneuvering got him the top job in the Indian Army — Chief of Army Staff from February 1986 to May 1988. His career is littered with trigger happy decisions, ill conceived operations, grandiose visions of fighting, and defeating, China and Pakistan at the same time, and almost high treason. But he is also credited with being India’s first “philosopher Chief”, who out shined his peers, had a direct line of communication with the Prime Minister, created India’s Mechanized Infantry Division and most importantly, wrenched the Army into the 21st century — a decade in advance.

**Of men, morale and machine**

General Krishnaswamy Sundarji, commissioned into the Mahar Regiment, was from that long line of erudite Indians who served the country impeccably before and after Independence — extremely well educated and presentable to the Western (English) world as one of their own. Not Indian royalty, but classy through dint of hardwork and an education at Eton, Harrow, Sandhurst and the lot. India already had Army Chiefs from the supremely well educated South — Field Marshal Cariappa, General Thimmayya, General Kumarmangalam and General KV Krishna Rao; although none who used their force of personality and the forces at their disposal to persuade their political masters — until General Sundarji.

The precursor to the infamous [Operation Brasstacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5d0iys/the_national_identity_iv_indias_original_cold/), India’s original [Cold Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5d0fvs/the_national_identity_iii_the_cold_start_doctrine/), was Operation Digvijay in 1983. Indian armour elements had traditionally travelled a maximum of 15km in a day — even during wars with Pakistan. Under (then) Lt. General Sundarji, armoured elements pushed 90km in dusk to dawn stretches. With little regard for support and excessive wear and tear in the deserts, Sundarji proved the point he always wanted to — he was a forward thinking General who could pull an unprepared Army into the 21st century. While Operation Digvijay got him noticed in New Delhi, it was his unique blend of eloquent talking (replete with buzz words), worldly wisdom, use of floppy disks and charisma that endeared him to the powers that be in New Delhi in 1985 — Doon School and Cambridge University classmates — Minister of State for Defence, Arun Singh and Prime Minster, Rajiv Gandhi.

General Sundarji also commanded Operation Bluestar, as the Western Army Commander, a year after Operation Digvijay — where there was widespread criticism of his methods by various Army commanders on the ground. What was also not lost on the Army, and the nation, was his use of tanks to enter the Golden Temple. It turned out to be the most enduring image of the disastrous operation — battle tanks are the modern symbol of oppression and occupation — from Amritsar, Berlin, Prague to Tbilisi. If there was one operation which baptized his induction, in his own eyes, into the Armoured Corps it was Operation Bluestar.

A favourite of General KV Krishna Rao (another Mahar regiment officer), he received short, regular, albeit important, postings at the Army HQ in Delhi. As Vice Chief under General Vaidya (a highly decorated, twice awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, Armoured Corps officer) it was clear he was going to be appointed as the Chief — there were few serving Army Commanders at the time whose names were even heard of in the PMO. General Sundarji stood head and shoulders above his competition. He assumed the office of the Chief of Army Staff on 1 February 1985.

He saw his first task as improving the Army’s morale. Although not planned in a direct attempt to do so, the daring Operation Meghdoot, to capture and control the Siachen Glacier, was an unqualified success and it buoyed the mood both in Delhi and across the ranks of the Indian Armed Forces. The first hints of General Sundarji’s grand design were beginning to appear — he wanted the Indian Army to assume an “offensively-defensive” posture and deter the development of battlefield (tactical) nuclear weapons by Pakistan.

Operation Meghdoot was quickly followed by [Operation Brasstacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5d0iys/the_national_identity_iv_indias_original_cold/) — which brought a freshly nuclear armed Pakistan and India to the brink of full-scale war. There were wide-spread reports of excessive wear and tear of machinery and men who didn’t fully understand the operation. It was, General Sundarji’s, ultimate expression of his flamboyant style and his last attempt to receive approval, from the Armoured Corps, that he so desperately craved.

Battle tanks covering 90kms in a day, racing up full throttle on 70 degree sand dunes — leaving the support and extra armament far behind — was [Operation Brasstacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5d0iys/the_national_identity_iv_indias_original_cold/) on the ground. [Operation Brasstacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5d0iys/the_national_identity_iv_indias_original_cold/) on the political football pitch was a supremely confident and egoist general, fresh off a string of high altitude victories in Siachen, trying to coerce “the young boy”, as he disparagingly referred to Rajiv Gandhi, into a war with Pakistan. General Sundarji, it was reported at the time, wanted to incite a first strike from Pakistan and in response — march unto Lahore, while laying waste to Pakistan’s retaliatory apparatus.

**Operations in other theaters**

>“Of all the generals I have met in South Asia and elsewhere, Sundarji stands out for his professional and intellectual ability to apply modern science to the art of warfare. However, what surprises me the most is the fact that the rise of Sundarji coincided with the rise in Indian military activism, as evident from Punjab to Checker Board and Sri Lanka. No other Indian general has had such impact.” — Stephen Cohen, the renowned American security expert

Operation Falcon and Checker Board, on the North Eastern border with China in 1987, were also conducted during a time of peace negotiations, and this forced China into a more warlike and rigid posture. Rajiv Gandhi, again (like Operation BrassTacks), had to personally hold out an olive branch to Beijing to undo the damage caused by these Operations of the Indian Army. Senior officers, who served with him in the South Block, and attended cabinet meetings, speak of General Sundarji’s constant efforts to convince the ministers of the Army’s capability of winning wars on both fronts — he was rightly admonished a few times.

Operation Pawan, sending in 80,000 troops into Sri Lanka, was perhaps General Sundarji’s ultimate expression of his own beliefs — an aggressive assertion of the Army will lead to regional clout. In typically flamboyant fashion, and with limited preparedness, two of India’s strategic reserves — the 36th and 54th Divisions, were deployed to Sri Lanka — with outdated maps and limited intelligence.

**A disputed legacy**

>“The Brass Tacks concept of war is for the year 2000 and not for present needs. The integrated concepts of ground-air battles, air assault divisions with tanks moving for nine hours a day cannot be carried out with our present capabilities. It is only a peek at the future with the consequent strain on resources and equipment. [Brass Tacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5d0iys/the_national_identity_iv_indias_original_cold/) may have given individual soldiers and units of the Indian Army an opportunity to prove their staying power and stamina and instill a sense of pride. But it damaged a lot of the armour.” — A serving Corps Commander on Operation Brass Tacks in 1987

Whilst, we all hope for the day the best of our skills can be married with a role we serve in our professional careers — very few of us actually have the capability, let alone the opportunity. Doctors marrying hospital management with, well, being doctors. CFOs leading the marketing function at FMCG companies. Think, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniack rolled into one — the aesthetics and technology residing in one brain. The Indian Army got that combination — an Infantry officer who commanded an Armoured Division, raised India’s first Mechanized Infantry Division — thereby marrying the characteristics his two Corps — the one he was commissioned into (Infantry) and the one he adored and converted to (Armoured). However, while far from a Frankenstein monster, this combination also unleashed the sort of ego, charisma and sure-footedness that almost led India to wars on two fronts.

General Sundarji, much to his credit, succeeded in marrying the armoured and infantry elements into a new Corps — the Mechanized Infantry. This Corps successfully integrates all the five components of a rapidly mobile war machine — men, weapons, protection, mobility and communication. When one understands the true genius of this Corps, General Sundarji’s futuristic doctrine of engaging rapid and mobile Integrated Battle Units to punitively punish Pakistan, for terrorist attacks, becomes apparent.

The failure of Operation Parakram, after the 2001 Parliament Attacks, when the Indian Army following the operational procedure of [BrassTacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5d0iys/the_national_identity_iv_indias_original_cold/) took three weeks instead of the necessary 72–98 hours led to the development of the Cold Start doctrine — modeled on General Sundarji’s ultimate vision — to take the strike capability away from Corps sized formation and into division sized battle groups comprising of mechanized infantry, air defence, artillery and armoured elements which could strike independently and with stealth.

The biggest criticism of his hawkish stance was that it spread India’s forces too thin and it led to the entire Army being tired. Peace deployments of 30 months, for Infantry battalions, were halved to 15 months. Armoured divisions were constantly engaged in grueling exercise upon grueling exercise. Operation Brasstacks, Operation Meghdoot and Rajiv, Operation Pawan and Operation Falcon and Checkerr Board — the Indian Army was at its’ most stretched, in every possible way, during General Sundarji’s 820 day tenure. Tied down in active operations from Siachen to Jaffna and the Rann of Kutch to Tawang.

His organization changes to the structure of the Indian Army, were also carried out in his own image of a steward of divisions and corps — erudite, open discussions and heavy on theory. What this necessitated was a top-heavy Army — appointments filled by an officer of the rank of Brigadier were now being tenanted by Major Generals and Lt. Generals were required to handle appointments which Major Generals were previously carrying out. It was his push to make the Indian Army a thinking Army. His vision and his push were noble, but the Indian Army, stiffly resistant to change, largely scoffed at it. In the years gone by since, it has continued to be an army led by a “soldier’s general” — an infantryman or armoured corps officer who has seen battle, won wars, inspires troops through his presence and speech rather than being led by a thinking general.

The legacy of an Armoured Corps led Army was also not lost in the years following his retirement, most of all on the Infantry — the traditional backbone of the Army. All the Principal Staff Officers (PSOs, holding the rank of Lt. General) under him were Armoured Corps officers, four of the six Army chiefs from 1983 to 1997 were from the Armoured Corps. And if you include the most famous convert, General Sundarji — five out of six.

*The immediate successor to this procession of Armoured Corps officers was General VP Malik — who had to deal with the Kargil conflict, a theater where Armoured elements had no role to play.*

QS University [R]ankings subject-wise for India,4,58ppbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/58ppbi/qs_university_rankings_subjectwise_for_india/,4,1477113512.0,"I was dismayed by regular newspaper headlines that there is no Indian university in Top 200 etc. So, I went for a deeper search and it is true. But, I also found out that the rankings for subjects can hide many things. For example: Look at IITB's page of Ranking (http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/indian-institute-technology-bombay-iitb) . While it is ranked 52nd in the world in Engineering, it is ranked in 160s in natural sciences and below 250 in social sciences. I thought it was unfair to lower rank of an Institution of ""Technology"" for not being good at Social Science. 

While I agree that a university should be teaching all subjects well, but we more commonly have institutes of specializations in India than an idealized university. Therefore I navigated the pages for only subject-wise ranking to get a better idea about where our institutes stand. My conclusion is that while we are not where we would like to be, we are also much better than we think we are from the media reports. Also, we do emphasize a lot on engineering.

Letter by comp engg student to his university,3,4v0zcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4v0zcj/letter_by_comp_engg_student_to_his_university/,4,1469745015.0,"This is a mail someone from my fb timeline wrote to the Admins of Hu University after dropping out from the CS Engineering Programme.

TLDR: Education needs major reforms.

""This is a mail that I sent to
Univ heads
and none of them ever replied.

Sir,
I have been a student of JECRC University since the last 2 years. I am currently enrolled in Bachelor's of Technology in Computer Science. And after 2 years of pure dedication, I am dropping out of your university. 

Why?  

Because my family had high expectations from me and I had high expectations from you. 

Where did you fall short?
I will guide you through my journey.

On the first day of my college I was bombarded with big words like Software Development, Android Development, Operating Systems, Web Development, Hacking, I thought after 4 years of my study I will easily be able to do any of these things. 

And that's the simple truth why I joined your college I did not join it for a degree, I joined it to learn these things. To be honest, I fell for your Ph.D. faculty in the beginning, I thought they know everything. In the first year of my college, I was taught subjects that were totally irrelevant to my field of study, I was taught subjects like Economics, Law, English, Physics, Chemistry, Maths; subjects I already had enough exposure to, since I was learning them since my school days. But education is built upon trust so I believed that whoever has made this curriculum must know that it is useful in someway in the future. 

I was very eager to get into the second year of the college as I was very eager to learn the 4-5 topics that I mentioned earlier. I completed the first year with a bang. 

Then comes the second year of college or the second half of my college life. I asked my friend to send me the time-table, so that I could have a look at the subjects that will be taught in the semester. He sent me a picture of the time table, I was delighted to finally see a bunch of computer science related subjects. That time table brought smile on my face! And I got back to the University as soon as I could because I did not want to miss any of the action related to computers from your faculty. The course started, after the first month or so I realized that Computer Science Engineering was missing Computer, Science and Engineering. Your Ph.D. faculty knew nothing about computers. What they were teaching was something that I already knew when I was in 10th standard. I came to know that I am stuck. I was demotivated, I was sad about the fact that I trusted your faculty, I had established a strong relationship with your university in the meantime, and I was possessive about it, and it was all in vain in just a month. I realized the fact that I have to do everything on my own as teachers in my college did not even know how to write a simple basic program. I went to my hostel room and started studying everything by myself. This continued for some days.  When I would ask your teachers for help they would ignore me, because of the fact that they did not know how to do it, I was even much more demotivated by this. I realized if teachers don't teach something useful and that too in the worst possible way and on top of that they don't even help me then why am I going to classes? I decided not to attend classes, as I was wasting my time and my family's money by just sitting there without any productivity. 

4  months later today, I am detained in all the subjects and I am restricted to appear in any of the examination. I am happy, like I was happy to see the time table in the starting. I am happy because I could study whatever I want to, and I am not cramming a piece of paper day and night, rather than that I am working on projects, that really matter to me. I am learning how to build things, I am learning to make things efficiently. I am learning what really matters to me. I am not learning for a piece of paper, that I will get after 4 years of frustration, or some people call it graduation. I am learning for education, to make myself skilled, to make myself employable, or even in the worst case scenario if I don't get employed somewhere I can do something of my own. I don't want to be dependent. I want to be on my own. When I told teachers that I am dropping out they would argue that even in IITs it is the same case, they teach the same syllabus that we do. Well IITs have well qualified staff and when they teach they attract students. I have enrolled in many courses offered by IITs and I have seen the difference between IIT and JECRC. Please don't compare IIT with this university yet. 

But yes education in Computer Science is not upto the mark in most of the colleges in India. 

Whom to blame? Syllabus? Can't blame it, as JECRC University is autonomous institute, they have right to set their own syllabus. Now whom to blame? I would blame the unwilling behaviour of the college authority and the norms set by UGC and past HRD ministries. In education you have to think about things that are coming up in the future, you have to teach the students about the uncertain future. But ironically the syllabus is almost 40 years old now, which is totally irrelevant in modern context, and in your microsoft labs the technology used in the labs is at least 20 years old. Students don't know how to use a basic framework, how will they make a software? Leave that, students don't even know how to output ""Hello world!"" on the screen. 

It would be very sick of me if I would just criticize the way you are working. So here are some problems that I faced and some suggestions that could be implemented for the problems. I am just talking about Computer Science Branch.
Motivate your students.
Even though your university is brand new but you need to update the technologies that are being used in the college. It's high time that we move onto the newer things like Javascript or Python. Or if you want to stick to C++ then please update the version to C++ 11. The C++ we are working on in our labs is a version made in 1990s and hardly any open source software use it.
Teach how to use external libraries and frameworks. Nobody likes to write 1000 lines of code when you can do it in 10-15 lines using an external library or framework. 
Teach students how to implement things in classes using a computer attached to a projector, and let students work on projects in labs based on what you taught in class. 
Make course website for all the courses that are being offered in the university. Like this one http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/
Use online forums for class discussion like Piazza.
Assignments must be productive, it should not be about filling copy pages. It should be about practically working on something.
Scrap final exams. Instead ask students to work on projects and asses their grade based on how well they did in the final project. 
Teach how to use tools like Git and Github, testing frameworks and IDE in software engineering, it is not a theoretical subject. Same goes for other subjects. Teach skills.

Make big lecture halls, lecture halls that could accommodate 600 people. There is no point of hiring 6-7 different unskilled teachers to teach the same thing, rather than that, hire just one teacher in a subject who knows the subject to the absolute core and who know how to teach. 
Make attendance non-compulsory until and unless you have good teachers, students are scared of authority but I ain't, so let me tell you, they always criticize you for this.
Classes are for sharing knowledge, it is not for dictating notes. 60-70% of the time in most of the classes is spent only on dictating notes and filling copies. I never believed in writing notes and I used to practice this since I was in school. I never wrote notes until I was forced to or I felt that it is something useful. Students here pay enough tuition fee that you could provide us with handouts for the lecture. Or even a .pdf file will work out pretty well. In the time you get during the lecture, implement programs or do things practically and let students see the beauty of computers.
Appoint TAs (teacher assistant) from the students who already had studied the subject and did it with excellency. I would love to be a TA for OOPs and Intro to C Programming and Data Structure and Algorithms.
Never argue that Indian Universities do not work like the way I want it to be. Indian community is based on many old beliefs that we need to overcome now, in order to develop wholly.
I don't know why some of your teachers have so much egoistic problems. They just can't get the fact that they are wrong. 
A teacher put a semicolon just after void main () and when told by the students that it is wrong she argued that it is right for 15 minutes on this.
Another teacher argued that he does not refer Indian authors when he was proved wrong by an Indian author's book and let me tell you the book was right!
A teacher got troubled during practical examination when a student's code was working when he was using variable names as x and y instead of i and j. And she asked him, how the code is working when he is not using i and j and the student instead of arguing and wasting time, changed the variable's name to i and j.
So make sensible decision before hiring a teacher, remember that teachers build future and we don't care whether they are XII pass-out or IIT pass-out until and unless they teach well.

Let students strive for education and not for a degree. Degree should be the last thing that should come to someone's mind.
Educate students about what they are learning how it is applicable in the real world. Nobody wants to learn something of no use.
Join Skill India Movement and use your asset, the students, that you have and do something productive, skills is what separates an engineer and a clerk. Students are creative, and they are the new you. They hold the capability of inspiring whole nation but they can't do it without skills.
Stop snatching students parents' money, if a router get stolen in a hostel don't just simply impose 200rs. fine on every student and grab 35,000rs. for a 1,200rs. router. Instead install surveillance cameras and hire watchman for every floor and claim them responsible. We are not your watchmen that we will take care of your routers. 
Internet is very important nowadays. It has good as well as bad aspect but look at the bright side and provide good internet services in the hostels. At least 2 MBPS  should be the internet speed. Charge 5000rs more but do this with immediate effect. I have a video conference coming up and I have internet with a speed of 50 KBPS in which I will do 'babaji ka thullu'. (Update : Because of the high speed internet (50KBPS) I could not attend the conference)
Instead of giving classes for MBA it would be much more sensible to tie up with an institute that would teach Computer Science and its fundamentals. They already have great hand-picked teachers with them.
Stop scaring students that they won't be allowed to sit in placement session if they don't do this or that.
Support me if I join politics.
I have vested interest in education, as a matter of fact I come from a family who has a school of their own. I am against this education system since I got into high school. Why study Physics, Chemistry, Maths for the entrance test when all you have to do is study Computer Science Engineering in a college and you know it is your 'kick', I am not saying that these subjects are not important but except maths nothing is important in Computer Science Engineering. Why not rank students based on interest in particular field when they appear for a particular college? Why not someone who always wanted to learn how machine works not taught how machine works during school, why when I loved computers in school I was forced to study chemistry? By doing this education system is killing the creative capability that we posses.

Skills are much more important than a degree. Education is about education, it is not about a degree. 

Why not you initiate the change? You hold a prominent position in Indian society, why not you take good decisions for the betterment of the community as well as the students you are serving? Why Prime Minister Narendra Modi is running skill India movement and why we are allotting degrees in an unskilled manner and ensuring that the students don't get good jobs?

Rajiv Gandhi - the visionary,4,3przr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3przr2/rajiv_gandhi_the_visionary/,11,1445553054.0,"1. Before he became the PM, one of the things he did was organise the 1982 Asian Games which was very well organised.  It wasn't like Commonwealth Games organised few years back. The Asian Games also saw a change in policy of allowing import of Colour Televisions and Asian Games were telecast in Colour.  

2. Abolished Estate Duty which was an Inheritance Tax.

2. Rajiv Gandhi emphasized industrial de-licensing and deregulation. The first wave of dismantling of the “license Raj” came within the 12–18 months of his taking office through the announcement of the new Industrial Policy. The GOI also constituted many government committees during this era to conduct a long overdue review of the system of price controls and of the licensing regime. These committees recommended a “shift from physical to financial-levers’ controls” — in effect, deregulation of the industrial sector. This was the first time reforms were done and not rolled back. The government implemented many of these recommendations resulting in industrial growth of more than 8 per cent on average for the period 1985–90. The capital market was also buoyant in this period as loosening of direct controls, particularly in the field of industrial licensing, signaled higher profitability. 

2. After becoming the PM, Rajiv Gandhi's government removed numerous controls on the industry and on imports.  The new policy allowed the import of fully assembled motherboards with processors and reduced import duties. This led to a sharp reduction of price and a speedier spread of computer use. In 1984, Rajiv Gandhi initiated Liberalisation of the Computer Industry. The Indian software industry as we know it today was thus born (it existed before but wasn't really significant).  

3.  * In 1985, Gateway Design automation starts software development work for export in Delhi.  
  * In 1985, Citibank sets up software development unit in SEEPZ, Mumbai.   
  * In 1985, SOFTEK was the first company to develop compilers for COBOL, BASIC, and FORTRAN for locally made computers.   
  * In 1985, CAD Centres setup at IISc/Bangalore, IIT/Kanpur, IIT/Bombay and Jadavpur
University at Kolkata.  
  * In 1985, Computer Assisted Literacy And Study in Schools (CLASS) programme launched by the DoE to cover 250 schools all over India. Uses BBC Acorn microcomputers – 4 given per school. The UK government gives
UK Pounds 1.3 Million for the project.   
  * In 1985, Government of India approves setting up of a National Supercomputer Centre at the Indian Institute of Science at Bangalore with a grant of Rs.500 million.  
  * In 1985, TCS established India's first client-dedicated offshore development centre, set up for clients Tandem.  
  * In 1985, HCL sets up core team to develop the required software Advanced Ledger Posting Machines (ALPM). ALPM becomes the largest selling software product in Indian banks.   
  * In 1985, HCL started designing and selling Unix based computers and also IBM PC Clones.  
  * In 1985, Indian software export is USD 30 million (CMC, TCS, and TBL main contributors).  
  * In 1985, Texas Instruments facility at Bangalore established to export electronic CAD software using satellite communication with its Dallas Centre in the USA.  
  * [ERNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERNET) was established in 1986.   
  * In 1986 software companies were allowed to import computers at reduced import duty rates to enable them to export software.    
  * In 1986, Wipro started marketing indigenous Personal Computers (though they had ventured into the computer field some years back, they were still more known for their Shikakai Soap at that time).   
  * In 1987, Infosys opened it's first international office in Boston.   
  * In 1987, Satyam Computers was founded.    
  * In 1987, [NICNET](http://www.nic.in/) was established.   
  * In 1987, the first Software India Conference in the USA to promote software companies.  
  * In 1988, Excise Duty was exempted for software.   
  * Because of an embargo, India could not purchase Cray supercomputers. So in 1988, Centre for Development of Advanced Computers (CDAC) established in Pune to design and fabricate parallel computers with 1Gflop speed. This lead to India's first supercomputer PARAM.
  * In 1989, VSNL sets up 64 Kbps link to the USA.
  * In 1989, NCST connects ERNET to Internet via UUNET.  
  * In 1989, Datamatics, a software services company, uses satellite link to the USA to export software.
  * In 1989, India’s software services export reaches USD 100 Million.   

4. His government also introduced the computerised Railway Ticket reservation system - computerised not in a way that people could reserve their own tickets (there was no internet then) but the railway clerks who issued you tickets now used a computerised system. This allowed the Railways to increase no of booking counters and greatly eased the burden of booking a railway ticket. Till then the no of booking counters were less and you had to stand in long lines.   

5. In 1984, his government established [C-DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-DOT) as an autonomous body.  Its goal was to develop telecommunication technology to meet the needs of the Indian telecommunication network. Landlines were analog till then. C-DOT digitised the switching. This was a landmark time in India's telecom history. Telephones were not even common in cities till then, but now telephone exchanges were started even in rural areas.   

6. How did most people make a long distance call before Rajiv Gandhi (if you were lucky enough to have a phone that is)? You did something called ""booking a trunk call"". You called the operator and gave her the number and name of city/village you wanted to call. After an hour or two, the operator would call back and connect you. C-DOT changed this.  
   
7. However most people didn't have phones. It was still a luxury item. And those who did have phones mostly didn't have STD facilities on their land lines. Rajiv Gandhi established MTNL and also introduced PCOs (manned Public Call Offices or Telephone booths). PCOs spread around the country like wildfire. PCOs allowed people who didn't own telephones to make calls. Plus it also allowed people who owned telephones but did not have STD facilities to go and make long distance calls. Very soon, something even more convenient sprung up - if you regularly made long distance calls, you could have an understanding with your neighborhood PCO - you called him from your home phone and he conferenced in the long distance call you wanted to make and you paid him the next day (or may be in advance). PCOs were one of the hottest businesses and were ubiquitous. And everybody had telephone access now. It was a radical change.  

8. VSNL was setup in 1986 by the Government for overseas communication.  

8. Rajiv Gandhi established committees to study infrastructure delivery, PSU reforms, railway reforms etc. A lot of study done during this period laid the ground work for many reforms done by the PVNR-Manmohan Singh team.  

9. Rajiv Gandhi also reduced the voting age from 21 to 18.   

India was never the same again.

How to search for a job?,3,3a992z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3a992z/how_to_search_for_a_job/,17,1434636676.0,"Okay. Let me start by telling about myself. I graduated from computer science and did not sit for any tests or interviews at that time because i was not sure if I wanted to continue with this field. After the graduation I came back home, I sat around some time doing nothing. Few monthis later I started trying my hands at some thing like cooking and stuff but eventually I became convinced that the problem is me and I have no passion. 

I don't think I did anything in college, just whiled away the time i had. The only thing I had done in my college was some web development(not really), I could do some html,css and php but no javascript. So after the college I started learning javascript, on the way i learned some jQuery, some AngularJS, some nodeJs with express. So we are back to the current time, past 10 days i have been trying to design a website using these technologies with some major hiccups in the way. 

Now that i have lived at home long enough i want to search for a job. Most of my friends are either going abroad or working in a company like TCS, Infosys etc. I have never searched for a job or sat down for one. The thing i have heard the most from the people is that to find a job go to bangalore and you'll find it there. I am ready to go to bangalore but how do i find a job there? I want to find a job related to javascript or something. I tried searching the web for some job postings but all i found was naukri.com postings and most of them want people with 3+ years experience.

Any of you experienced with this can help me out? Call me stupid or whatever just help me out. How do you go around searching for a job? Any info is appreciated.",4
[AskIndia] When will Indians start having a serious discussion about UFOs and extraterrestrial phenomena? [SERIOUS],0,4jp74o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4jp74o/askindia_when_will_indians_start_having_a_serious/,6,1463488201.0,"[A small request: Even though this is a long post, please do read it *fully* before posting a response. Thank you!]

**A little context before I begin:** I have witnessed UFOs on multiple occasions in my life, in our very country. Now, I'm specifying this first because most people have some weird (and ridiculously misinformed) notion that only (stoned/crackpot) people in the US of A see such things. And yes, I totally understand that any flying objects that one cannot immediately identify/classify come under the UFO category - they could well be drones or weather balloons for all that matters.

However, the ships/crafts that I have chanced upon displayed characteristics that even the most advanced of military crafts, whatever I know of them, couldn't possibly display. More specifically, things like 'sentience'.

As far as things go, I'm fairly certain that for all the so-called 'tinfoil hat' talk about *technologies hidden from mankind*, we are still a wee bit far from playing God and being able to create lightning-quick spacecrafts that act *'alive'*.

Now, I know that this is an *otherworldly* topic and the mere mention of it is bound to raise eyebrows and words like 'unscientific', 'hallucination' and ""I want what you've been smoking"". This, is obviously saddening, and prevents so many people from speaking openly about their very legit experiences because of the fear of being ridiculed, joked about and whatnot; which is a major hindrance when it comes to discussing and properly understanding these issues. Thankfully, I don't care what people think of me...which I would say is somewhat a (beneficial?) side-effect of being born introvert.

And yet, whenever I've tried to discuss such issues with people (regular people/smart people/'intellectual' types) in real life, I've observed the following:

i. The topic is made fun of before it even begins.

ii. If you still try to discuss it and/or share your experiences, people have that 'sarcastic look' on their face, and beyond that, the idea that you're trying to make up stories to feel superior to others or something. (If anything, you're risking all of your social acceptability by speaking out openly about such things, but that's a different matter altogether).

iii. The rather hilarious recommendation that ""You should totally go watch Ancient Aliens on this <someTVchannel> bro. You'll totally love it!"". You'll be surprised at the number of times this has occurred; heck I could post screen-grabs from Youtube/Reddit of conversations having these, which apparently happen like *all the time*.

Here's the thing: I'm not saying that we should discuss this phenomenon because of what people like me saw or did not. And I'm definitely not saying we should talk about it because the westerners have been talking about it forever and we are totally failing at keeping up the trend (because aping *'firangs'* is India's prime hobby and all that).

I'm bringing this up because there are very real people who have experiences and stories to share which might just be true for all you know. I'm speaking about this because -- just because news stations such as India TV/Aaj Tak/News 24 and other TRP-hungry channels have made such a mockery and joke out of this topic by randomly throwing around sensationalist (and downright stupid) headlines, DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN that anyone and everyone willing to speak about these things is a liar, attention-seeker, delusional, and/or comedy fodder.

Most people I know like to think of this topic as something to be talked about when you're chilling with friends at night (preferably with weed to keep you company) and something that's just fun-to-discuss-when-you're-bored...much like, ""Yaar! let's share some ghost stories yaa!"" (cringe). And then there are those who wish to act like redirect-links to that popular TV show, which is basically a: ""F--- off with your alien BS, why don't you go watch that TV show where they discuss similar nutcase, *unscientific* things all day and leave us to discuss more important things such as <randomceleb's> sex life?"".

It's more annoying than you'd think.

And finally, the most important part: ""proof""

*Now, these are the things that happen with the proof part:*

i. It's often NOT too likely that you'll be able to take out your camera/cellphone in time and flip the damn app open until that phenomenon lasts. Like for real, if you're one of those few people who have been fortunate enough to witness the speeds at which these things can travel, you'll know exactly what I'm saying here.

ii. When the phenomenon does last longer and one does manage to capture something, there is a almost certain compromise with clarity. And OF COURSE it will have issues no matter what camera you use because you're practically trying to capture something that's probably miles away in the night sky without specialist equipment, the kind which probably costs way more than your average fancy smartphone, or even DSLRs for that matter. If you doubt this, you're more than welcome to flip your cellphone camera out and click a bright full-moon in a clear sky...and see the results for yourself.

iii. Lastly, in case of mass sightings, well, *this* happens: http://imgur.com/cBz2kpe

I did check the references for the Wikipedia article so the quotes are valid. Which basically means that the **DIRECTOR of Birla Planetarium actually expects people to believe** that an unidentified flying object which rapidly changed shapes and colours in the most inexplicable of ways, and was witnessed by hundreds of people....is f------ VENUS. Like SERIOUSLY?????

Strange how they didn't teach me *any* of these fancy facts about Venus in class (or like, ever)! Which brings us to the question as to who exactly does this guy think he's kidding? And how and why exactly are people so easily buying into these clearly *unscientific-beyond-unscientific explanations*coming from prominent scientific figures, at times even coming from ISRO scientists? Has India, the country of probably millions of engineers and IIT grads and cool Silicon Valley professionals completely lost hope when it comes to rational scientific inquiry and proper discussions of unexplained phenomenon? Or am I seriously missing something?

I'm so lost for words here.

Now, I may not have proof for whatever I witnessed; but there have been everything from ancient cave paintings depicting UFOs/aliens all around the world (including in India at Charama); stories of tribes like Dogon, who had advanced scientific/astronomical knowledge in the 15th century that modern science still has no valid explanations for, and databases like MUFON which are keeping a full record of hundreds of unexplained sightings each year. Add to it an endless number of videos being uploaded each week on Youtube...surely ALL of them can't be false, right? And not all of them are about weather balloons, drones and reflections either, considering that some of those spacecrafts do things that exceed our own imagination at times. Even statistically, it's impossible that everyone's simply lying about things all the time since like centuries now; so how about we grow up and discuss the damn thing for a change?

I understand that this question turned into a rant of sorts; but then, somebody simply had to say this all in order to shed light upon a topic which has been depicted/discussed/explored throughout history from everything between art and science to mythology...and where there's smoke billowing from like everywhere from SO DAMN LONG, there's a good chance of there being an actual fire under there somewhere as well.

About time us Indians grew a pair and at least showed a willingness to discuss these things, for once. Unless of course, that's *'unscientific' and 'delusional'*...like that pathetic cover-up guy from the planetarium whom I shudder to call a scientist (or even associate with science for that matter) if he was indeed quoted accurately by the press. Same applies to the guys over at ISRO.

[R] What exactly is the problem with genetically modified crops for India ? Aren't they a good thing if properly regulated ?,4,23t6wo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/23t6wo/r_what_exactly_is_the_problem_with_genetically/,30,1398323188.0,"In a poor country like India isn't it a good idea if we can genetically modify crops with greater yields and resistance to fungus/insects/disease ?

Selective breeding has been a part of agriculture for thousands of years, isn't genetic engineering just fast tracking this ? Why is it so bad ? Isn't it the next logical step in industrialized farming ?

I always thought the anti-GMO movement was from green parties and anti-corporate organizations, often using pseudo-science and anti-technology sentiments to push their agenda.

To be fair Monsanto does scummy things, but being fundamentally opposed to GMO entirely seems ridiculous to me.

This seems to be a really hot-button issue outside of India, but rarely talked about here. /r/skeptic, /r/changemyview, /r/politics and /r/conspiracy talk about this a *lot*.

What happens to A straight officer in India,43,oi74e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/oi74e/what_happens_to_a_straight_officer_in_india/,22,1326682015.0,"Mr. Narayanaswamy

First Rank in State in Secondary School Examination

First Rank in University in Plus Two

First Rank in IIT Entrance Examination

First Rank in All India IIT Computer Science

First Rank in IAS Entrance Examination

First Rank in IAS Training Institute

 

On passing out from IIT Chennai Mr. Narayanaswamy was offered scholarship by the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology , USA .. He who came from a 
middle class family believed that he had a moral obligation to give something in return for the lakhs of rupees the government spent on him as an IIT student. He had the intelligence and conviction to realize that this money came also from the poorest of the poor - who pay up the excise duty on textiles when they buy cloth, who pay up customs, excise and sales tax on diesel when they travel in a bus, and in numerous other ways indirectly pay the government. So he decided to join IAS hoping he could do something for the people of this country. How many young men have the will power to resist such 
an offer from USA ? Narayanaswamy did never look at IAS as a black money spinner as his later life bears testimony to this fact.After a decade of meritorious service in IAS, today, Narayanaswamy is being forced out of the IAS profession. Do you know why?

A real estate agent wanted to fill up a paddy field which is banned under law. An application came up before Narayanaswamy who was sub collector the, for an exemption from this rule for this plot of land. Upon visiting the site he found that the complaint from 60 poor families that they will face water logging due to the waste water from a nearby Government Medical College if this paddy field was filled up was correct. Narayanswamy came under intense political pressure but he did what was right - refused permission for filling up the paddy field. That was his first confrontation with politicians.

 

Soon after his marriage his father-in-law closed down a public road to build compound wall for his plot of land. People approached Narayanaswamy with complaint.When talking with his own father-in-law did not help, he removed the obstructing wall with police help. The result, his marriage broke up.

 As district Collector he raided the house of a liquor baron who had defaulted Rupees 11 crores payment to government and carried out revenue recovery. A Minister directly telephoned him and ordered to return the forfeited articles to the house of the liquor baron. Narayanswamy politely replied that it is difficult. The minister replied that Narayanaswamy will suffer.

In his district it was a practice to collect crores of rupees for earthen bunds meant for poor farmers, but which were never constructed. A bill for rupees 8 crores came up before Narayanaswamy. He inspected the bund. He found it very weak and said that he will pass the bill after the rainy season to ensure that the bund served the purpose. As expected the earthen bund was too weak to stand the rain and it disappeared in the rain. But he created a lot of enemies for saving 8 crores public money. The net result of all such unholy activities was that he was asked to go on leave by the government.  

Later such an illustrious officer was posted as ""State Co-Ordinator, Quality Improvement Programme for Schools"". This is what the politician will do to a honest officer with backbone - post him in the most powerless position to teach him a lesson. Since he found that nothing can be achieved for the people if he continued with the State Service he opted for central service. But that too was denied on some technical ground.

 What will you do when you have a brilliant computer career anywhere in the world you choose with the backing of several advanced technical papers too published in international journals to your credit?

 When you are powerless to do anything for the people, why should you waste your life as the Co-Ordinator for a Schools Programme?

Mr. Narayanaswamy is on the verge of leaving IAS to go to Paris to take up a well paid United Nations assignment. The politicians can laugh thinking another obstacle has been removed. But it is the helpless people of this country who will lose - not Narayanaswamy. But you have the power to support capable and honest bureaucrats
like Narayaswamy, G.R.Khairnar and Alphons Kannamthanam who have suffered a lot under self seeking politicians who rule us. You have even the power to replace such politicians with these kind of people dedicated to the country. The question is will you do the little you can do NOW? At least a vote or word in support of such personalities?

"[P] So, here's what I think of where we are after all these years watching.",4,2wfs5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2wfs5n/p_so_heres_what_i_think_of_where_we_are_after_all/,9,1424389483.0,"Hey watsup guys. Now here is something which has been brewing in my head for some time, and I need to get this out in the open.

We All.

I hate the place we are at this moment of time. Illitracy, wealth disparity, exploitation, slavery are eating through the sole of humanity. We are a high tech civilization, which cannot guarantee equal access to the people which built it. On one hand we plan reusable rockets and space tethers, and on the other hand, Boko Haram is raping our children. We are witnessing exponential developments in science when the antigod of religion is turning humans into demons.

I could never understand the point of this cosmic accident. What are we here for? To kill each other in the name of petty, hypothetical beliefs? To selfishly enjoy the material comforts. To dwell in the past glorifing the deeds of our ancestors. I dont know. I just know that the way thing are going, is wrong, even by the lowest moral standards. Whose responsiblity is it? Who answers for this, misplaced suffering? Most people I know, don't care. In the age of the Social Network and instant communications, people don't want to let the cries of fellow humans spoil their profile. It's as if we have forgotten our oneness. Money and the constant run to feed our own is making us ignore the shrill noise of our own cries.

The Third world.

I am from India. Its a strange country. Naked children sleep on pavements of private schools. Women get raped, rightious are shot and the country sleeps a satisfied sleep every night. I know things are similar in the whole subcontinent. Millions of children are born daily whithout a roof on their heads, while houses lay empty waiting for a buyer. I see talented and intelligent people running for jobs and useless rich guys roaming around killing people on the foot path. I see myself running behind a lifestyle which I know, wont bring me any more comfort or growth than I already enjoy.

My brothers and sisters accross the border in Pakistan are in similar plight. Schools are being bombed and inoccents are murdered. I hear that the crime rate is very high and educational facelities just as low. A guy I talked to once spoke of losing hope and trying to go west, just like people here. Over in Bangladesh american garment companies I heard, are putting people into wage labour with life qualities comparable to boiler chickens. Iraq and Afganistan are torn apart and “Bombed back to stone age” as the vain pigs say.

I see us laughing on each other. Atleat we are better off than them, we say. What we know and dont appreciate is that accross all thoes borders and inside thoes burning houses live ony people. Like you and me. People who are agitated by deaths of their children. People who are uncomfortable about their future. People like you who have been denied choice. We forget that we are one in our sorrow.

The West.

Now theres these contaries which claim to be the light bearers of humanities future. They give out awards to our people for exeptional work in peace and simultaneously attack us with wepons having fancy names. They come smiling in formidable jets and bulletproof cars to rob us our sovirgin rights. These people give scholarships to our brilliant as if in charity and seduce them with money they got aplenty. Buying into the souls of our leaders they have impaled our dreams. When I see wars fought just to get our resources my soul cries. Every news of bombings, resulting directly from the bloody ploughs of western war economy reaping gold, where we seeded life kills my hope.

They ruled our lands for centuries. Killed our people, and raped our land for their use. They deprived our children of the basic needs. Enslaved us with state policies calling us indians. I say we should forgive them for the sins of their ancestors. Its best forget how the best of our people fought them for food, land and the right to freedom and how they lost their lifes and potentials for asking what was rightfully ours.The past can't be reclaimed, but the present may not be forgiven.

The Change we need.

We think in groups, religions, countaries, classes and races. They may be important but the most the most important indentity is our being human. It is the identity which binds us together in our pursuit of the unknown. Strength is in unity they say, and there are eight billion of us out here. Just thinking of what all thoes unique minds can accompalish when provided with the tools and mediums we have developed over the years is exeptionally hopefull.

Technology deprivaion disables people. I dont know how to do it, sadly. Most answers to this question are vague and inaccurate but, we need to make our technological innovations accesible. Capital is the main problem here. But, who knows something may be worked out sooner or later.

Public opinion is powerfull, but an educated public can be the true force of change. We need to devise a way to cheaply and efficiently teach our children. They are our responsibility, all of them because we got here first. Educating the people around you can alone solve most of the problems we have. If you cant teach yourself, donate to organisations. Help someone with their tution fees. Give them a chance at the future.

Vote for non confrontational governments if you can. War is a problem in itself. We should not let the west force this useless fight anymore. We should realise that are being taken for a ride here.

We sould work now to save the future. 
NOT AN ESSAY.

[NP] Future-proofing your/your kids education K-12-PHD. Ideas on promoting innovation and creativity cost effectively in Indian context.,7,3n3o89,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3n3o89/np_futureproofing_youryour_kids_education_k12phd/,3,1443735949.0,"Problems with Indian education system are well known. rote-learning, memorization, exam-grade-centric, highly standardized, disconnected, lacking flexibility, no gamification, lacking creativity. When science/math education isn't in vernacular medium, memorization is further encouraged. It's a continuation of the British Raj's gift to generate self-hating obedient & dependent clerks. Any minuscule trace of creativity or critical thinking/practical application skills here are generated DESPITE the education system. 

[This is a video from Ken Robinson that summarizes common problems with the education factory production line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2Nz2X0AEXw)

Meet [Erik Demaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Demaine) 

He was homeschooled till age 12 and entered college at the age of 12. Finished bachelors at 14. Finished PHD at 20. He got numerous awards and achievements. Has a very interesting creative portfolio. Education of the future means making the average child what is a ""child prodigy"" in today's term. This, is very much needed to combat the ""educational inflation"" where curriculum for undergraduates decades ago is now the curriculum for 10th graders. If you are an average kid today, you would have been a prodigy a few decades ago. 

Our nation desperately need more personalized/customized/adaptive, blended project based learning. Unfortunately we have the added burden of overpopulation, No significant education budget, bad internet, population disconnect, no outlets to exhibit and appreciate creative projects, no high level career prospects and for startups no proactive community of early adopters. The next generation, especially those in India, has it tougher to prove their worth in an unhealthily competitive scenario. 

So here are some of my general suggestions - 

1. Forget about grouping students in terms of age groups. Group people by ranges of skill levels. Or better, make fluid groups that make groups irrelevant. Like a real high performance work groups. 

2. Skip excessive emphasis on memory and repetitive aspects. Memorizing walls of texts in languages you do not understand is of no good. Only learn concepts that are extremely difficult to automate or compute. 

3. Have crowdsourced version control systems for syllabi. Syllabi should be fluid like poetry and allow cross-domain applications. Add interactive progression tracks and gamification. e.g Khanacademy, Coursera, etc. 

4. Standardized testing should exist and continue to exist. But it is stupid to judge students on what they write in a restrictive 4 hour exam alone. This can be solved with better remote, proctored more frequent exam dates where students take tests when they comfortable and can repeat them forever. Also add crowdsourced curation of qualitative projects and continuous evaluation works better. 

5. If technology allows open crowdsourced active grading that would really helpful. Something like a reddit-like marketplace for grading and answering where students and teachers both have reputation weightages. Would be fun to watch a Child in rural Chattisgarh get graded by Assistant professors at MIT. This needs careful tuning of incentive mechanisms.  

To make it more specific, this is what I would do for my kid -

1. During non-mobile phase, Early exposure to videos, songs and movement inducing tech toys. (irrelevent plug -> soylent based wholesome organic homegrown nutrition)

2. In mobile phase. Customizable sand castles, trampolines, lots of cartoons, vehicles, art, games (physical and video) and other toys/setting that encourage motor skills. 

3. Playschool, swimming, hobby culbs and other group games for physical activity and socializing. 

4. Introduction to math, programming structured grammar, kid stuff. Fast forwarded cartoons at 2x to learn faster more diversely in lesser time. Prepare for group projects, reiterative IQ-psychometric tests and competitive olympiads. 
	
5. Start 10th Grade curriculum when is 10 years old. Finish 12th Grade by age 12. Learn bachelors by 14. Repeat another Demaine. 
	
Yea he will go through home-schooled syllabus - AP, A levels or other foreign syllabi + Standardized certs + Professional certifications if you have the money. Else, go for minimum - NIOS/Other. For Bachelors a theoretical degree could be complemented with practical/vocation technical certifications for better employability. Never forget innovative projects. 

Ofc limitations exist as not every course can be learnt through distance mode or online where the teacher can be forwarded/paused or rewind the video unlike teachers who get irritated if you ask them to repeat. If you wanted every teacher to repeat without irritating them, you'd have to build the time machine. That level of acheivement would make you noble prize worthy unlike making obscure computer programs that can cure aids. So getting real again, there is no present method where the best teachers at MIT are going to clone themselves to tutor every student in the world. There's something more efficient than that called MOOCs. They triumph over averaged traditional education system anyway.

For programs that need costly equipment and practical labwork. Distance is out of the rule, so they would turn more competitive than theoretical fields like math/cs/business/fin/soc. sciences etc. However if the function of ""common labs"" on hire is made possible in different geographic locations, then the learning such subjects remotely would be possible.

THE SATURDAY ESSAY Updated August 3, 2013, 4:46 a.m. ET
The $4 Million Teacher
South Korea's students rank among the best in the world, and its top teachers can make a fortune. Can the U.S. learn from this academic superpower?
By AMANDA RIPLEY
Kim Ki-hoon earns $4 million a year in South Korea, where he is known as a rock-star teacher—a combination of words not typically heard in the rest of the world. Mr. Kim has been teaching for over 20 years, all of them in the country's private, after-school tutoring academies, known as hagwons. Unlike most teachers across the globe, he is paid according to the demand for his skills—and he is in high demand.


SeongJoon Cho for The Wall Street Journal
Kim Ki-Hoon, who teaches in a private after-school academy, earns most of his money from students who watch his lectures online. 'The harder I work, the moreImake,' he says. 'I like that.'

Mr. Kim works about 60 hours a week teaching English, although he spends only three of those hours giving lectures. His classes are recorded on video, and the Internet has turned them into commodities, available for purchase online at the rate of $4 an hour. He spends most of his week responding to students' online requests for help, developing lesson plans and writing accompanying textbooks and workbooks (some 200 to date).

""The harder I work, the more I make,"" he says matter of factly. ""I like that.""

I traveled to South Korea to see what a free market for teaching talent looks like—one stop in a global tour to discover what the U.S. can learn from the world's other education superpowers. Thanks in part to such tutoring services, South Korea has dramatically improved its education system over the past several decades and now routinely outperforms the U.S. Sixty years ago, most South Koreans were illiterate; today, South Korean 15-year-olds rank No. 2 in the world in reading, behind Shanghai. The country now has a 93% high-school graduation rate, compared with 77% in the U.S.

Tutoring services are growing all over the globe, from Ireland to Hong Kong and even in suburban strip malls in California and New Jersey. Sometimes called shadow education systems, they mirror the mainstream system, offering after-hours classes in every subject—for a fee. But nowhere have they achieved the market penetration and sophistication of hagwons in South Korea, where private tutors now outnumber schoolteachers.

Viewed up close, this shadow system is both exciting and troubling. It promotes striving and innovation among students and teachers alike, and it has helped South Korea become an academic superpower. But it also creates a bidding war for education, delivering the best services to the richest families, to say nothing of its psychological toll on students. Under this system, students essentially go to school twice—once during the day and then again at night at the tutoring academies. It is a relentless grind.

The bulk of Mr. Kim's earnings come from the 150,000 kids who watch his lectures online each year. (Most are high-school students looking to boost their scores on South Korea's version of the SAT.) He is a brand name, with all the overhead that such prominence in the market entails. He employs 30 people to help him manage his teaching empire and runs a publishing company to produce his books.

To call this mere tutoring is to understate its scale and sophistication. Megastudy, the online hagwon that Mr. Kim works for, is listed on the South Korean stock exchange. (A Megastudy official confirmed Mr. Kim's annual earnings.) Nearly three of every four South Korean kids participate in the private market. In 2012, their parents spent more than $17 billion on these services. That is more than the $15 billion spent by Americans on videogames that year, according to the NPD Group, a research firm. The South Korean education market is so profitable that it attracts investments from firms like Goldman Sachs, the Carlyle Group and A.I.G.

It was thrilling to meet Mr. Kim—a teacher who earns the kind of money that professional athletes make in the U.S. An American with his ambition and abilities might have to become a banker or a lawyer, but in South Korea, he had become a teacher, and he was rich anyway.

The idea is seductive: Teaching well is hard, so why not make it lucrative? Even if American schools will never make teachers millionaires, there are lessons to be learned from this booming educational bazaar, lessons about how to motivate teachers, how to captivate parents and students and how to adapt to a changing world.

To find rock-star teachers like Mr. Kim, hagwon directors scour the Internet, reading parents' reviews and watching teachers' lectures. Competing hagwons routinely try to poach one another's celebrity tutors. ""The really good teachers are hard to retain—and hard to manage. You need to protect their egos,"" says Lee Chae-yun, who owns a chain of five hagwons in Seoul called Myungin Academy.

The most radical difference between traditional schools and hagwons is that students sign up for specific teachers, so the most respected teachers get the most students. Mr. Kim has about 120 live, in-person students per lecture, but a typical teacher's hagwon classes are much smaller. The Korean private market has reduced education to the one in-school variable that matters most: the teacher.

It is about as close to a pure meritocracy as it can be, and just as ruthless. In hagwons, teachers are free agents. They don't need to be certified. They don't have benefits or even a guaranteed base salary; their pay is based on their performance, and most of them work long hours and earn less than public school teachers.

Performance evaluations are typically based on how many students sign up for their classes, their students' test-score growth and satisfaction surveys given to students and parents. ""How passionate is the teacher?"" asks one hagwon's student survey—the results of which determine 60% of the instructor's evaluation. ""How well-prepared is the teacher?"" (In 2010, researchers funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation found classroom-level surveys like this to be surprisingly reliable and predictive of effective teaching in the U.S., yet the vast majority of our schools still don't use them.)

""Students are the customers,"" Ms. Lee says. To recruit students, hagwons advertise their results aggressively. They post their graduates' test scores and university acceptance figures online and outside their entrances on giant posters. It was startling to see such openness; in the U.S., despite our fetish for standardized testing, the results remain confusing and hard to interpret for parents.

Once students enroll, the hagwon embeds itself in families' lives. Parents get text messages when their children arrive at the academies each afternoon; then they get another message relaying students' progress. Two to three times a month, teachers call home with feedback. Every few months, the head of the hagwon telephones, too. In South Korea, if parents aren't engaged, that is considered a failure of the educators, not the family.

If tutors get low survey marks or attract too few students, they generally get placed on probation. Each year, Ms. Lee fires about 10% of her instructors. (By comparison, U.S. schools dismiss about 2% of public school teachers annually for poor performance.)

All of this pressure creates real incentives for teachers, at least according to the kids. In a 2010 survey of 6,600 students at 116 high schools conducted by the Korean Educational Development Institute, Korean teenagers gave their hagwon teachers higher scores across the board than their regular schoolteachers: Hagwon teachers were better prepared, more devoted to teaching and more respectful of students' opinions, the teenagers said. Interestingly, the hagwon teachers rated best of all when it came to treating all students fairly, regardless of the students' academic performance.

Private tutors are also more likely to experiment with new technology and nontraditional forms of teaching. In a 2009 book on the subject, University of Hong Kong professor Mark Bray urged officials to pay attention to the strengths of the shadow markets, in addition to the perils. ""Policy makers and planners should…ask why parents are willing to invest considerable sums of money to supplement the schooling received from the mainstream,"" he writes. ""At least in some cultures, the private tutors are more adventurous and client-oriented.""

But are students actually learning more in hagwons? That is a surprisingly hard question to answer. World-wide, the research is mixed, suggesting that the quality of after-school lessons matters more than the quantity. And price is at least loosely related to quality, which is precisely the problem. The most affluent kids can afford one-on-one tutoring with the most popular instructors, while others attend inferior hagwons with huge class sizes and less reliable instruction—or after-hours sessions offered free by their public schools. Eight out of 10 South Korean parents say they feel financial pressure from hagwon tuition costs. Still, most keep paying the fees, convinced that the more they pay, the more their children will learn.

For decades, the South Korean government has been trying to tame the country's private-education market. Politicians have imposed curfews and all manner of regulations on hagwons, even going so far as to ban them altogether during the 1980s, when the country was under military rule. Each time the hagwons have come back stronger.

""The only solution is to improve public education,"" says Mr. Kim, the millionaire teacher, echoing what the country's education minister and dozens of other Korean educators told me. If parents trusted the system, the theory goes, they wouldn't resort to paying high fees for extra tutoring.

To create such trust, Mr. Kim suggests paying public-school teachers significantly more money according to their performance—as hagwons do. Then the profession could attract the most skilled, accomplished candidates, and parents would know that the best teachers were the ones in their children's schools—not in the strip mall down the street.

Schools can also build trust by aggressively communicating with parents and students, the way businesses already do to great effect in the U.S. They could routinely survey students about their teachers—in ways designed to help teachers improve and not simply to demoralize them. Principals could make their results far more transparent, as hagwons do, and demand more rigorous work from students and parents at home in exchange. And teacher-training programs could become far more selective and serious, as they are in every high-performing education system in the world—injecting trust and prestige into the profession before a teacher even enters the classroom.

No country has all the answers. But in an information-driven global economy, a few truths are becoming universal: Children need to know how to think critically in math, reading and science; they must be driven; and they must learn how to adapt, since they will be doing it all their lives. These demands require that schools change, too—or the free market may do it for them.

An Exposition and Solution to the NGO problem,1,28fy7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28fy7b/an_exposition_and_solution_to_the_ngo_problem/,1,1403105851.0,"**Disclaimer**: I am not the author. This excellent essay was written by Rudradev@BRF.  

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair?

We really need to talk about Flairs.,108,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,1494883276.0,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",5

I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights,98,c95ykl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/,47,1562293745.0,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",5

**Manifesto**

&#x200B;

There are problems in the way we govern our country today and the political parties of today are too entrenched in their histories (dynasties, Hindutva, regionalism, casteism, communism, crony capitalism, et cetera) to be able to find the solutions India needs to move forward.

Indian humanist Party (IhP) is a facebook page for finding those solutions. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.

The principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.

**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.

We believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:

1. The primacy of fundamental human rights
2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.

**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**

This is a 50-year project.

The RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.

Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.

**Metrics driven**

We will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:

1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)
2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)
3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)
4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)
5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)
6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)
7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)
8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)
9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)
10. Gender equality report (87/144)

We will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.

**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**

Capitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.

**We are committed to internal democracy**

As a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.

**National security**

We will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.

**Caste and reservations**

We absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.

Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.

Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.

**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**

We believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.

Individuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.

**Science and business**

We will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.

Talk to you guys about my life in china,4,c629ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c629ts/talk_to_you_guys_about_my_life_in_china/,13,1561647389.0,"Five years ago, I was a Indian college student and I didn’t know anything about my own future.
 Just as I am about to graduate, I get an opportunity to study in China, and China’s policy for foreign students is tuition-free, and there are 20,000 scholarships each year.
 At this time, my brother told to me: ""China is also a developing country. The level of consumption is also very low. Our uncle is doing medical equipment business in Yiwu, China. You can also try it.""
 When I was confused, I followed my brother's advice and set off to study in China.

 Learning Chinese is not difficult at all, and oral Chinese is much easier. I was studying in Hangzhou, so I have visited around Zhejiang. 
 When I visited my uncle, I learned about the company him worked with, called Sunny world medical. I search it in google. I was very envious of my uncle, I wondered that I will become a millionaire just like my uncle after graduation. 
Now that India’s economy is improving day by day, people’s demand of medical care is even greater.
 So I took the opportunity to contact the medical device company named Sunny world medical in China.  I borrowed money from my uncle and contacted sunny world medical to place an order.
 This simple operation made me earn more than 20,000 CNY, nearly four times of the profit!

 At this time, I met a Vietnamese girl named ""Mary "". Her Chinese is better than me. I really like to study with her in the library.  Just then, a Pakistani man appeared.  After he came, Mary started  pay less attention to me day by day.
 I took this opportunity to express my confession, but she sent a text message saying that I am a loser, a social failure! This is really irritating!
 I am a South Indian, only 5 feet 5 inches tall. The Pakistani guy is 6 feet 4 feet tall.
 Mary must have dismissed my short. However, as a man, it is useless to be tall. What is important is how high his ambition is!
 So I worked hard and made another 60,000CNY in the previous method, and then I was only 22 years old!

 Thanks to the lack of the Indian market's large demand for the medical device industry, thanks to the sincerely Sunny world medical. Now, I am holding the tall Chinese girlfriend ,Sofia, I am no longer feel sorry about my own sense of failure. Because a man doesn’t depend on how tall he is, but how tall his wallet is.
 But sometimes ,especially at the midnight,i still miss Mary. What does she do? Does she happy? It not because how much i love her, but i love the most marvelous moment of myself.",5
Why didn't 'Nehruvian Socialism'/'Mixed economy' work?,12,c3cy06,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c3cy06/why_didnt_nehruvian_socialismmixed_economy_work/,8,1561163959.0,"First of all I would like to say, I have never studied economics and don't understand it very much either. So, if possible ELI5.

All I have seen since I became politically aware a few years ago, is that there are people in America and India fighting about whether Socialism is good or Capitalism is good. Here is what I have gathered so far:

Nehru was influenced by Europe. So, he chose the European model (which is socialism, as I have read) to implement in new India (after independence) in contrast to American model which was capitalistic. It helped start India but India lagged behind other developing nations, progress was 'slow'. Then, in 1990, 'economic liberalization' happened and we became capitalistic. Our economy got a boost. So, as people claim, Nehru's socialism didn't work.

However, European countries are rich and successful nations (that's what I have heard) even though are are 'kinda' socialistic, i.e., a 'Mixed Economy' which combines socialism and capitalism. I have heard from other sources that Nehruvian socialism was actually mixed economy and not hardcore socialism like, say, Soviet Union. I have also heard that under Barack Obama, USA was a mixed economy too. If that's the case, why didn't mixed economy work here? What was the problem?

USA voted for Trump because of capitalistic economic policies. So, I conclude that people of USA were fed up of mixed economic policies. So, did mixed economy fail to work in USA?

Also, a side question: Mixed economy didn't work in early India. Does that mean it still won't work, or ever work in the future?",5
What are your initial /thoughts reactions to the Union Budget 2019?,11,c9qvq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c9qvq4/what_are_your_initial_thoughts_reactions_to_the/,1,1562426607.0,"I thought its been 24 hrs and enough has been said about the budget so wanted to see what the general consensus about the budget in this sub.

UNION BUDGET 2019:-

Is the Gandhi Family suppressing the Left-Wing of India? (I am a Foreigner),13,bu2q23,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bu2q23/is_the_gandhi_family_suppressing_the_leftwing_of/,12,1559092730.0,"Recently, I have wondered whether the Gandhi family has truly hindered many progressive policies in order to uphold the Status Quo. 

We have seen this with Manmohan Singh, in which during UPA 2, Sonia Gandhi indirectly took more control over the party and we saw the downfall of many sectors of Government. Another instance of this is how the Gandhi Family disrespected Narasimha Rao, India's most progressive leader. A man who was able to liberalize the Indian economy and initiate many reforms within the Government. The Gandhi Family did not even allow Rao to have his funeral in Delhi and moved him back to Hyderabad.

Even as we witness AAP, which seems to be a Congress Party without the Gandhi family, it seems to be much more progressive and eager to change than Congress.

So as a non-Indian, I am curious, do you believe the Gandhi family is suppressing the Left of India, as it silences more progressive reforms and legislation, in favor of status quo?",5
A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,9,bwmz0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwmz0o/a_criticism_of_the_new_education_policy_2019_and/,6,1559671479.0,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

"'The Husband, The Wife and The Wife Deserter': A Tale Of Triple Talaq.",2,c3okk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c3okk1/the_husband_the_wife_and_the_wife_deserter_a_tale/,2,1561231312.0,"As the Triple Talaq Bill is on the verge of becoming an actual law, let's take a look at what triple talaq is, what it is not and what really is at the heart of the whole debate. 

Triple Talaq is something that Islam itself traditionally frowns upon. Scholars have warned against it since time immemorial and it's generally strongly disliked. Its sole purpose was to serve as a remedy for the *really* troubled marriages and some historians believe that it was originally granted by the Prophet as a means for the 'women' who were married to the most despicable men so that they'd escape that relationship as soon as possible. But, as often tends to happen with most well-intentioned laws, people managed to find the loopholes and favored the 'letter' of the law over the 'spirit' of the law. And as such, most Muslims would be absolutely okay with the illegalization or nullification of triple talaq, but more on that towards the end.

Speaking of laws and women, Islam is the first religion in history to have given women 'rights': social rights, ownership rights, inheritance rights, marriage rights, the right to initiate divorce, the right to remarry, the right to be a witness and give testimony in matters requiring the same, the right to do business (the Prophet's first wife, Khadijah, was a wealthy merchant herself), the right to fight in battle and many many more. Fourteen HUNDRED years ago. 

But, over time, some Muslims twisted the teachings of Islam to suit their own purpose, misused and downright *violated* the very laws of Islam protecting the sanctity of women's rights.. And, over time, it also became okay for the rest of the world to somehow always find a way to judge the 'entirety' of the Muslim community and religion based on the examples set by these worst of Muslims, who are completely unrepresentative of both Islam and most Muslims. 

Anyway, before I digress, coming back to divorce.. So, more than 1400 years ago, Muslim women were granted the right to initiate divorce through the legal sharia process referred to as *'khula'*. (This when women around the world were either burned at the stake for wanting rights or had to promise to be married to the same man for seven lives or had to throw themselves into the pyre with him when he died.)

This is what the normal, the more 'preferred' mode of talaq (divorce) looks like: It's supposed to be done in three stages, over a period equaling roughly three months, and only after the grounds for it have been firmly established (infidelity, adultery, betrayal, loss of affection, etc). Even this 'normal' form of divorce is only meant to be the 'last resort' when nothing seems to have worked to save the marriage. The first month, provided the grounds for divorce are not major (infidelity and/or adultery) and if there is the slightest hope for reconciliation, both the spouses are encouraged to find common ground and rethink their stance, the second month, once again, is time for reflection and possible reconciliation, and only at the end of the third month, when *all* attempts at reconciliation have clearly failed, is the divorce deemed to be finalized and can the spouses part ways.

Anyway, THAT is the 'normal' approach of going about divorce in Islam. And surprise surprise, THAT is how most Muslims actually go about getting a divorce. Most Muslims, too, generally hate the idea of triple talaq. Remember, it's *supposed* to be an absolute last-resort measure, *if that*. Here's a report based on a survey which found that of all the divorce cases amongst Muslims, a mere '0.3' percent were identified as those performed through triple talaq. Less than 1 percent. 

https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/unimportance-of-triple-talaq-supreme-court-muslim-law-4678304/

Yes, 0.3 percent. THAT is how low the incidence of triple talaq really is. Let me just say it once again so it really sinks in. ZERO POINT THREE percent. 

But, how many of you knew that? Or rather, how many of you were led to believe that 'most' of the divorces among Muslims happen the triple talaq way? Or that it's so prevalent among Muslims that 'millions' of Muslim women are simply abandoned by their husbands within seconds? Or that it's because Islam itself encourages it? Or that it's because women simply have no rights in Islam to begin with? 

Many, if not everyone. 

That brings us now to the second, the hidden yet the more important part of this discussion: the 'politics, propaganda and Islamophobia' aspect of it. 

If you could time-travel to today's India from ten years before, odds are you'd find it barely recognizable. 2019 was supposed to be the year when we were just a year away from the watershed moment we dreamed of that would forever change our nation's destiny. We were going to be a developed, happy, prosperous nation, the vision of APJ Abdul Kalam come to life. 

But, it's safe to say that that dream is much farther from being a reality *today* than it was ten years ago. And however unrealistic or unattainable that dream may have been to begin with, I am sure nobody in their wildest dreams ever imagined an India where a 'terrorist' would be elected to the parliament and become a 'lawmaker' in 2019.

A deeply radicalized, bigoted and easily manipulated religious majority has set the country back by many many years, if not decades. Such is the level of toxic propaganda and such is the intolerance of the truth that nothing and absolutely nothing seems to have the potential to stem the flow of this madness anytime soon. 

And it is in this backdrop that it became possible for a man who abandoned his mother, abandoned his wife decades ago and presided over riots that saw hundreds of women get brutally killed and thousands get raped, to rise to be the 'messiah' for Muslim women and their rights and for everyone else to buy into this whole charade. 

And this allowed everyone to believe that the 'logical' solution to correct the injustice of triple talaq was to 'jail' the man for three years based on a report filed by almost anyone, keep the woman on a measly welfare fund for the same duration, keep her children far away from their father and, thus, eventually, to 'save' the marriage. 

If you still think that the triple talaq bill, in its present manifestation, is anything other than a deeply hateful, vengeful exercise of power through which to punish Muslims for, well, *being* Muslims, you clearly are on the wrong side of history.

What happened to BSNL?,88,b2flpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b2flpy/what_happened_to_bsnl/,34,1552922129.0,"I think BSNL was sabotaged internally for the profit of private companies.

* BSNL used to be a very good provider of telecom services in the country. I remember it was the first telecom company that came into our small town, it provided very good service for that time, it was relatively cheap and reliable. It was also the first 3g provider in our area.
* But somehow, quality of its services went downhill over the years,nowadays the network goes down in my area very frequently due to some fiber optic cut, or sometimes something gets stolen from the tower premises and nobody seems to care.
* Everybody in my town had at least one BSNL sim which they used, but after the disruptions everyone got frustrated and switched to other providers.
* At the time of 3g allotment, BSNL was forced to take the spectrum in all circles by matching highest bid price in that circle. I don't understand why couldn't the govt give the spectrum for free in the first place. After all it's a govt entity, and everybody must have known it would kill BSNL.
* The government didn't even allocate 4g spectrum to BSNL, it was like the final nail in the coffin.

Edit!

* Many of you are looking at BSNL as a separate non government for profit entity, which i don't, I see it as publicly owned utility which is an absolute must for our modern times, not just for remote or non profitable areas but for every location in the country.
* BSNL wasn't as bad as some may believe, it was definitely not up to the mark like Airtel, but it wasn't as bad for that time, we never had network outage of any kind, and was cheap too. It went from average to worse in the last decade only.
* The argument that free spectrum for BSNL may seem unfair for private companies, i would have accepted that if we had a truly free market economy, we never had one, free market in our country only exists for a very few oligarchs, it is used by the govt at its whim.
* I will give you an example, take the case of India Post, it's a PSU and a very well functioning PSU, should we have charged some license fee for it to operate? We have a perfectly good model how shipping and courier companies work in India, they work just fine alongside IndiaPost. Unlike the IndiaPost's case, telecom spectrum is a limited resource so we need a barrier for the entry, but private companies should have survived that too by limiting the amount of services BSNL can provide.
* Also, BSNL wasn't in any sort of bad shape before the 3g spectrum drama, it wasn't in debt, it had huge reserves, to the tunes of 35000 crore which the govt forcibly took from it as a licence fee. All the policies regarding 3g spectrum allocation wreaked havoc on the telecom industry, BSNL drowned in debt not because of being a PSU but because of incompetent governments and its policies like most other private telecom companies.
* BSNL management didn't live in a vacuum, they perfectly knew 4g was coming and they were not slow or incompetent they were sabotaged internally to act like this.
* It's not just Modi, both the BJP and Congress are complicit

Coal in the United States is a dying industry. Coal mines in West Virginia and Wyoming have long been [closing](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/west-virginia/articles/2018-10-13/large-west-virginia-coal-mine-with-400-workers-closing) their doors, and total coal consumption in 2018 is close to half of what it [was ](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37692)a decade ago. It is likely the coal power plants will struggle to survive without [subsidies](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/06/06/donald-trump-hopes-to-save-americas-failing-coal-fired-power-plants). However, it would be a mistake to assume that coal is a dying industry. Many large countries, including India, Indonesia, and China are rapidly increasing their use of coal. In today's podcast episode, I will be exploring India's coal industry, focusing on the struggles of Coal India, the public sector enterprise that dominates coal mining, to dig up enough coal to meet India's demand, the inability of coal and other extractive industries to bring development to the regions where they are most active, and the implications of India's increasing use of coal on the global environment.

Coal India Limited, a state controlled mining company that [controls ](https://www.coalindia.in/DesktopModules/DocumentList/documents/Annual_Report_&_Accounts_2014-15_Deluxe_version_In_English_03102015.pdf)82% of the coal market, has dominated coal mining in India since its creation in 1971. Coal India has struggled to meet the demands of India's rapidly growing economy because it is expected to provide coal to power plants at costs well below global market levels. Coal India was forced to sell coal at prices 70% below market [averages](https://www.ft.com/content/9233696a-8323-11e1-9f9a-00144feab49a), reducing Coal India profits by half. Similarly, Coal India has long [subsidized ](https://www.brookings.edu/research/indian-railways-and-coal/)passengers on Indian Railways by paying above market rates to transport coal. Coal India is legally obligated to hire all of those its mines displace, and strong unions command wages that consume [half ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/coal-india-high-wage-bills-cast-a-shadow-on-coal-majors-numbers/articleshow/13617713.cms?from=mdr)it revenues. Moreover, corruption and mismanagement at the highest level have resulted in windfall gains to connected companies of [$33 billion](https://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/our_products/audit_report/government_wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2012_2013/Commercial/Report_No_7/Report_No_7.html) . A violent and powerful coal mafia has [emerged ](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-coal-jharkhand-dhanbad-coalindia/special-report-coal-mafia-stokes-indias-power-crisis-idINDEE94D00B20130514)that skims money off of each stage of coal production and distribution, with ""Goon taxes"" rising as [high ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208)as 10%. The combination of these factors means that Coal India does not have nearly enough money to invest in mechanization and new technologies. Labor productivity of Indian miners is only 4% of that of those in the US, and only 1 in 10 mines are [mechanized](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/what-s-keeping-india-dark). The result are severe shortages in coal that act as a serious break on rapid [development](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/indian-govt-grapples-to-find-causes-of-coal-shortages-2018-11-26).

A problem just as severe as Coal India's inability to produce enough coal for the Indian economy, is the fact that coal and other extractive industries have failed to bring prosperity and development to the regions in which they are concentrated. A vastly disproportionate share of India's coal reserves are located in the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. These states are the home of around 8% of India's population, but [over ](http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy%20Statistics%202019-finall.pdf)two thirds of India's coal reserves. India's iron ore, bauxite, and copper reserves are all disproportionately located in these [states](http://www.jsmdc.in/web/AvailabilityofMineralsinJharkhand.php). However, these three states are also among the poorest in India, with rates of GDP per capita, and human development metrics such as infant mortality substantially worse than the [national average](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States&fromdate=03%2F02%2F2019&todate=03%2F04%2F2019). Moreover, despite wealth of natural resources, these states have seen substantially lower rates of growth than the national average. These disparities are especially striking that many mines are located in adivasi or indegenous lands. The adivasi populations of the region are consistently at the bottom of these impoverished societies, and see few of the benefits of mining. It has been estimated that mining led development has displaced [lakhs ](http://indr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/B.-Terminski-Mining-Induced-Displacement-and-Resettlement.pdf)of people. In theory, Coal India is obligated to provide employment to these displaced people, but has only managed to provide jobs for a small [minority](https://books.google.com/books?id=BxDKhOnWwOsC&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=tribe++employment+%22coal+india%22&source=bl&ots=mKvZZWjGxn&sig=ACfU3U2jNdOszeIC3kEvO_E3Ft7pU3xKtA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwii5fKs-YPiAhUDMawKHcwOC-Y4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=tribe%20%20employment%20%22coal%20india%22&f=false), while pollution has impacted the livelihoods of many who . Many adivasi people have turned to the Naxalites, a radical and [violent ](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Maoists-trigger-train-crash-100-die/articleshow/5985997.cms)Maoist terrorist group, out of desperation and many ordinary people have been [caught ](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/bastar-tribals-raise-their-voices-against-naxal-atrocities-118032900569_1.html)in the [crossfire](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/chhattisgarh-activists-up-against-salwa-judum-atrocities-107090601020_1.html). While Naxilte rebellion has lost power over the last 8 years, the underlying roots of the conflict have not been addressed.

India's coal industry has consequences that extend well outside of India. India is forced to rely upon coal imports as Coal India has failed to met [demand](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-expects-india-coal-imports-to-hit-record-1557467616076.html) in India. India imported $25 billion of coal in [2018](https://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=1%7c%7c%7c%7c%7c2701%7c%7c%7c4%7c1%7c1%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c1), and is projected to become the largest imported of coal in the world in 2019.helping keep mines in West Virginia and Australia open. More important is the Indian coal industry on global climate change. While India is still taking [part ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news)in the Paris Accords, it has made promises of only modest cuts because coal is so central to its development strategy. To be clear, India is investing massively in solar and wind power. Total installed capacity of wind power has more than [quadrupled ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country)over the last decade in India, and 5.4% of India's electricity comes from solar power, a proportion more than [double ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country)that of the United States. Nevertheless, coal is likely to be king for the foreseeable future. Millions of Indians are [buying ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-in-indias-passenger-vehicle-market)their first cars every year, while India produces vast quantities of carbon [intensive ](https://www.devalt.org/newsletter/jan97/of_1.htm)products such as cement and steel. Most importantly, coal consumption is rising rapidly in India. The International Energy Agency projects coal use in India will [increase ](https://www.carbonbrief.org/iea-china-and-india-to-fuel-further-rise-in-global-coal-demand-in-2018)from 563 to 708 million metric tons, with total coal consumption increasing by more than 3% a year. Over the last decade India has grown only more dependent on coal, as the percent of electricity generated from coal increased [from ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.COAL.ZS?locations=IN)66% to 75% between 2007 and 2015. India [emitted ](https://www.axios.com/china-india-us-pushed-carbon-emissions-to-record-levels-in-2018-1b1e171a-d46a-49b7-bc4a-7250942a1a7d.html)2.6 billion of the worlds total 15.3 billion . While per capita carbon emissions are well below the global average, carbon emissions are increasing at a rate over 6% a year. Reconciling India's need for development and environmental concerns will be vital for fighting global warming.

India's coal industry is highly inefficient, a poor engine for raising standards of living, and dangerous to the planet. Nevertheless, the coal industry remains vital to the future of India's economy. Coal fueled the industrial revolution in 18th century England, the rise of America in the 19th century, and the spectacular growth of China in the 20th. Coal is likely to similarly, for better of for worse, likely to play the same role in the development of the Indian economy in the 21st century.

"Suddenly, ‘one nation, one policy’ sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman",7,azoh6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azoh6g/suddenly_one_nation_one_policy_sentiment_is/,3,1552304367.0,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

Questions for supporters of the current Government in India,61,9xtncw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9xtncw/questions_for_supporters_of_the_current/,67,1542458947.0,"I want to ask BJP and Modi supporters some questions.

Did or did not Modi say that all black money is in Swiss Banks? If he did, how much of that black money has come back in 4.5 years?

Did or did not Modi say that high prices of Petrol, Diesel and Gas have a bad effect on economy and that people of Gujarat are suffering because of bad policies and failure of Dr. Manmohan Singh's government? If he did, then how come prices are at an all time high now?

Did or did not Modi say that the falling value of rupee is because of corruption in Delhi? Then how come rupee went to almost 75 to a dollar? Would that also mean that there is still corruption in Delhi?

Did or did not Modi say that MNREGA is a living example of failure of Congress government which is getting ditches dug and filled even after 65 years of independence? If he did, then why did he continue the MNREGA program?

Did or did not Modi say that GST can never be implemented in India? If he did then why did he implement it and that too even on clothes and fabric (which has never been taxed in independent India)?

Did or did not Modi say that FDI will hurt the small retailers and kill the biggest segment that provides jobs? Then why did he allow FDI in retail and 100% FDI in single brand retail?

Did or did not Modi say that he will send Congress leaders and other corrupt people from his own party to jail? If he did, then how many people has he even filed an FIR, forget about sending to jail?

Did or did not Modi say that nobody will use a Bullet Train but we should have it just as a symbol of our technological achievement? If he did then why take a loan of 1,10,000 Crores to build some thing that nobody is going to use anyway?

Did or did not Modi say that he will give One-Rank-One-Pension to retired soldiers? If he did then how come he gave One-Rank-One-Pension-Every-Five-Years to them?

Did or did not Modi say that farmers will get 50% clean profit over and above their costs? Then how come there is budget for procuring just 5% of farmers production at that prices and the farmers are being left at the mercy of private buyers after Government procurement budgets and targets are met?

Did or did not Modi say that if people voted for him then they will be assured 'Good-Days' ahead? If he did, then has anyone seen those 'Good-Days' till now?

There is no reason to elect him or his party again.

On the contrary taking decisions like Demonetization and implementing a faulty GST and now the 59,000 Crore Rafale deal show that his decision making is faulty and damaging for the country.

In the Rafale deal he has committed treason (desh droh) with the country by reducing the number of aircraft from 126 to 36, paying extra price and hurting the PSU HAL at the cost of private entity of Anil Ambani.

It will be India's misfortune if he somehow comes back to power.

So if you are patriotic, throw out the garbage.

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",5

[Failed Modi Government ](https://i.redd.it/mq42u5cx0a511.jpg)

Man, when modi government came to power I have no hesitation to say that most of us were highly hopeful to achieve greater good, improve our fucking economy and that's it. What else anyone wants?. At the core of our wishes I have a feeling that this is what we wanted i.e. to make India a 'Better India' and a lot of problems can be solved. This government however focused on nothing more than 'Cow Politics', making swami's as cabinet, Chief minister etc. With zero domestic policies and a hugely failing foreign policy. China and our neighbors have vastly bad relations with us now. No other PM has done so many visits to other countries (and as we speak our Sushma Swaraj, President etc. ) are on their international trips as well which so to say our 'honeymoon getaway' nothing else. 

With hatred spreading all over and people getting lynched I see the only hope in 'Arvind Kejriwal' and don't get me wrong I've done my part being a devil's advocate for a long time and I've seen him work greater good than anyone else at the moment. He may be foolish, dumb and sometimes narrow minded but that's exactly the best option we got. However, him and this topic is for another time.

https://i.redd.it/fugc2pu51a511.jpg

We must remember what this government did to us and how we all came together to support modi's policies but little did it help the economy and us. Now suddenly, he wants to give farmers incentives and take my word before general elections BJP will dump billions of rupees to promote their campaign and spread lies and WE WILL forget everything!

IF WE WANT TO MAKE INDIA BETTER, don't forget this and to show your vote, bring the ones up that are doing good, educate your families, make wise decisions because every vote counts and none of these cluster fucks shall be left re-elected. We can do this randians. LET'S GET TO WORK!",5

Support parliamentary scrutiny against internet shutdowns #KeepUsOnline,35,a0gvsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a0gvsw/support_parliamentary_scrutiny_against_internet/,2,1543242484.0,"**Internet shutdowns are a growing national menace**

The internet continues to be shut down in different parts of India with increasing frequency. As stated in a[ recent op-ed authored](https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/there-is-no-evidence-that-internet-shutdowns-work/story-4aERxaY1OMNTG8siM0iMMM.html) by Apar Gupta, Executive Director and Raman Chima, Trustee and Co-founder of IFF, published in the[ Hindustan Times,](https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/there-is-no-evidence-that-internet-shutdowns-work/story-4aERxaY1OMNTG8siM0iMMM.html) ""*The answer has been evasion as the central government till date has refused to provide any count or centralise a reporting and disclosure system. We should not fear such data, and that such calculation may put us to shame, for even*[ *existing news reports*](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2018/india) *, India enjoys the top rank as the global leader in the number of Internet shutdowns.*"" 

This is a matter of national shame. We are losing on our rights and India's continued potential to lead the knowledge and skills economy which relies on reliable internet access. We have now started reaching out to parliamentarians on this issue. 

This continues our working model of activism where our public engagement is toward institutional outcomes. A short recap. We have through the #KeepUsOnline campaign reached out to 15,000 individual and 80 institutional signatories who petitioned the government to condemn internet shutdowns. We then followed it up with a series of RTI's which demonstrate the legal rules for shutdowns were made secretly, and most recently supported a legal analysis of these rules by one of the domain experts in the area, Nakul Nayak. 

We will continue working against internet shutdowns, meeting people, talking to them about them and ensuring India has a better rank in 2019. Do follow our updates.

**So, what is IFF doing about it?**

Next stop is parliament and we are looking towards our legislators. The dates for the winter session have been announced which commences from December 11. We sensed there was a need to reach out to the offices of various legislators in advance. As subject area experts we are attempting to set up time, talk to their offices and explain this issue to them. Our hope through such knowledge sharing and to enable greater parliamentary engagement on Internet Shutdowns in India. To enable this, two volunteers (Arpitha and Hardik) authored a brief of this issue which is now being sent across along with meetings to put this issue across to several parliamentarians.

**How can you help?**

* **Call on your lawmakers:** We urge each person to reach out to their member of parliament and discuss this issue. Their details are readily available on the [Lok Sabha](http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Members/AlphabeticalList.aspx) and [Rajya Sabha](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/memberlist.aspx) websites. Quite often, such conversations lead to positive outcomes. We also encourage you to email them our guide that is has been prepared with minimal supervision by staff — but completely by volunteers.

How many if you have even worked in bank before? There's a lot of work do deal with other than costumers. Anyone will tell you government bank jobs are the worst, low salary for too much pressure. Demonetisation was such a headache that people died because of it. In general the pressure is so much that employees even commit suicide. You have to reach your monthly targets at all costs. You can't give loans to people who don't qualify yet government makes dumb schemes for their own political agenda.  And after all of that you'll have to deal with dumb costumer who can't even fill a form properly. Also most of the frauds occur because of costumer negligence or because of their own family members, therefore they don't make it to the newspaper.

**ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS-JOY FOR INC, WAKE-UP CALL FOR BJP**

**Can the Congress upset the odds in 2019?**

The biggest question everybody had before today’s results was can the Congress fight back against Modi and BJP, especially with 2019 around the corner. While their performance in Telangana and Mizoram was disappointing, it will take heart from its wins in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. 

For a party which was in disarray until a year and half ago with no clear sense of direction from the party high command, the Congress has slowly staggered back onto its feet to fight the Modi and Shah duo. With a seemingly reinvigorated Rahul Gandhi at the helm, they have taken the fight to the BJP in Modi’s own bastion-Gujarat, cobbled together an alliance in Karnataka and now snatched Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh back from the BJP. 

While the party is trying hard to capitalise on the anger of the masses against the Central government’s policies and decisions, the Congress still has a lot of work to do on the ground level if it seriously wants to come back to power in 2019. While the results might show Congress winning in three states, there is a very distinct and real possibility that voters were fed up with their state BJP governments due to anti-incumbency and they are still going to vote for Modi to become the PM again in 2019.The Congress’s performance in Rajasthan is also considered to be relatively disappointing with chaotic seat distribution, infighting and rebel Congress leaders costing the party another 15 odd seats.

**What next for the BJP?**

While the results aren’t going to make BJP workers too happy, the BJP still remains in pole position to come back to power in 2019. With the so called ‘Third Front’ still nowhere near fruition and the Congress’s efforts to pitch RaGa against NaMo not exactly gathering steam with other opposition parties means that Modi continues to be the most popular political leader in India currently. The extradition of Christian Michel related to the Agusta Westland scam and the recent court order allowing the extradition of Vijay Mallya from the UK also serve as a timely boost to the BJP’s anti-corruption rhetoric, which was on a slippery slope after the Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi sagas. The BJP has also made no effort to hide its Hindutva agenda, starting with the renaming of Allahabad to Prayagraj and Faizabad to Ayodhya. BJP led state governments in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh also cleared the way for the building of gigantic statues of Lord Shiva and Rama respectively and this Hindutva pitch will only get more brazen in the lead-up to 2019.

While the BJP might be smug about its chances in 2019, it has to keep an eye on the grumbling middle class and farmers-both unhappy with poll promises not being kept. The agrarian distress and lack of job creation have taken the shine off Modi’s ‘booming economy’ pitch and the BJP will be anxious to ensure it doesn’t snowball further. Furthermore, the central government’s rift with the RBI and frequent clash-ins with the Supreme Court have created the image of an overzealous central government keen to take control of all independent central agencies. 

**Will KCR lead for the formation of a Third Front?**

TRS’s emphatic victory in the state of Telangana and K Chandrashekar Rao’s victory speech might mean the resurgence in the chances for the formation of a Third Front consisting of other regional satraps including Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati. The Third Front has traditionally been a cluster of regional parties which choose to neither align with the Congress or the BJP. However, the Third Front, which has always been talked of as an alternative to India’s two-party stronghold, has never managed to give a serious fight to the Congress or the BJP in recent history. The only times the Third Front or Federal Front provided a serious threat to the Congress or BJP was in between 1996 and 1998 when it staked power at the Centre twice under H.D. Deve Gowda. Quite predictably, the government collapsed soon after due to infighting and horse-trading of MPs. 

It will be interesting to see if a Third Front comes into existence in time for 2019 and more interestingly, if they can prevent making the mistakes that they have committed in the past and become a force to reckon with.

**Controversy about EVMs**

Adding further fuel to the EVM tampering controversy, it was reported this week by multiple news sources that CCTV malfunctions occurred in the strongrooms where the EVMs were stored. Technical snags in CCTV systems installed inside the storage rooms came from Vidisha, Mandla and Bhopal. In Vidisha, it is reported that CCTV cameras went blank for 15 minutes while the one in Mandla went blank for 2 hours. Tough questions must be asked of the Election Commission as to how such a situation was allowed to develop in the first place and what it plans to do to ensure the electoral system isn’t compromised.",5
China vs. India,23,92ar61,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/92ar61/china_vs_india/,16,1532708829.0,"So, the other day, I was having a discussion with a friend of mine. His point was, that communism help China control its population growth, and hence, ultimately its economy. This gist of his argument was that India also needs something of that sort, to put our economy on faster lanes. An example of this that he gave was of protests. They cause a lot of harm to the nation, and need to be suppressed.

I am of a different view altogether. According to me, any country that considers its population an impediment to its growth is going down the wrong track. China could manage its population so easily not because of the One Child Policy, but because they got on the manufacturing bus in time, and mobilised a lot of its rural population to urban areas. Employment lead to education, and that ultimately led to curbing the population growth. Talking about population, let me present the example of Japan. It is one of the country that have high population densities, but managed it so well that Japan was one of the best performing economies in the 2nd half of the 20th century. Their work-ethic and culture, combined with an inclusive government, made them the formidable country they are. Population is anything but a bane for India. All we need is an inclusive government that can actually use the demographic divided that we have. Currently, yes, that is more of a demographic interest for us.

Talking about protests, I am of the idea that they are integral to any democracy. Suppressing and banning them is fascism. Instead, we need a strong police to control them, and better leaders to actually listen to them. Banning protests is like banning fake news channels- which again is fascism. Instead, any fake news should be countered by two different, genuine articles. That's the basic essence of a democracy.

China attained economic prosperity, but at what cost? Millions have been killed trying to oppose the government. Incidents like the The Tiananmen Square show how unstable China can be. What if there's a series of dissents among different levels of the government, or the society? What will China do then?

Towards the end, I would just like to say that we have got to learn nothing from China, save their economic decisions. Communism is never the answer. Democracy is.",5

Sardar and Legacy [Spiritual Translation of Two Marathi Articles],3,9tsmlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9tsmlb/sardar_and_legacy_spiritual_translation_of_two/,3,1541263965.0,"The credit for integrating almost all princely states, barring three, before 15 August 1947 undoubtedly goes to Sardar Patel. But he was of tired body and mind post-independence and post-Gandhi assassination.

It's one thing to like historic fables and another to consider them history. There are often efforts to sell these fables as history. But it's time to look for true history. Currently certain fables are sold as history. Some of them are: Sardar Patel was Hindutvavadi and subsequently anti-Muslim, if he was leading the country instead of Nehru then all of our problems (i.e. Pakistan and Jammu-Kashmir) would've been solved already. Due to wishes of masses, these misunderstandings are considered history. There's effort to sell these fables as history.

First let's tackle most lethel delusion. That is had Mahatma Gandhi not put his weight behind Pandit Nehru, then Sardar Patel would've been our first Prime Minister. A most liked fable in halls of Whatsapp university. Reality however, begs to differ. Pandit Nehru wasn't chosen as Prime Minister at the last minute. It had been going under consideration since 1929. At that time Purna Swaraj (Declaration of Independence of India) under consideration which was officially announced on 26 January 1930. It's leadership came easily under Nehru because he was 2nd most popular leader of Indian National Congress after Gandhi. Then there was a challenge of elections as per Government of India Act 1935. For that, there was no other option than to handover the party presidentship to Nehru. The popularity necessary to win the elections was with Gandhi and Nehru. Sardar Patel was main fundraiser and chairman of Congress' Central Parliamentary Board at that time. However it meant Nehru had bigger responsibility since as a President, he was the face of the party. That is the reason why in 1942 Gandhi declared him as successor. The whole party stood with him and so strong was the resolve that in 1946 - a year before independence - Maulana Abul Kalam Azad resigned presidentship for Nehru.


It's interesting to check the delusions of people who claim Sardar should've been the Prime Minister. After his release from prison in 1945, he was not in good health. He was struggling with diabetes and blood-pressure and his mind was gloomy because of family issues. He had severe heart attack on 4 March 1948, barely a month after Gandhi assassination. Even doctors had given up hopes. Sardar survived but it took a toll on his health. He had said that next news won't be of my sickness but of my death. He died in December 1950. He didn't live to see first general election in India. Nehru was 15 years younger to him. Sardar belonged to generation of Gandhi and Jinnah and three of them died shortly after independence. Sardar Patel's own words are enough to remove any doubt about his desire for Prime Ministership. ""Desire demands youth and health. We have none."" He even conceded that the crowd at Bombay rally had 'come for Jawahar, not for me'.

This should tell us how unrealistic it is to claim Sardar for PM.


Now let us talk about partition. Sardar Patel was one of the first people to agree to partition proposal by Mountbatten. Nehru accepted it later. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on the other hand, staunchly opposed partition till the end. He was of the opinion that India shouldn't be divided. He himself had written it in his 'India Wins Freedom'. It might be politically incorrect to speak highly of Azad in current political climate. But it is documented history. Patel was first one to accept the truth that it isn't right to make Hindus suffer for dream of Undivided India. Nehru and Gandhi followed him to accept the bitter reality. So all three of them are equally 'responsible' for partition. It is  politically convenient to blame partition on Gandhi and Nehru. But it isn't reality. 

Finally, let's talk about his love for Hindutva. He had none as documented by many historians and journalists such as Narhar Kurundkar, Govindrao Talvalkar, Ramchandra Guha, Rafiq Zakaria, even American Vincent Sheean. He had major role in giving religious roles to Indian Muslims. Minority Institues also have special rights thanks to Patel. He never opposed leadership of Khan Abdul Gafar Khan in Northwest region, nor did he oppose Shaikh Abdulla in Kashmir. Not just that, but he never felt to limit rights of Indian Muslims after creation of Pakistan. It is also history that he had admonished Uttar Pradesh's then Chief Minister  Govind Vallabh Pant after idols of Rama were placed in Babri Masjid in 1949. He was of the opinion of resolving the matter through talks. There's also no example of Patel giving different treatment to Hindu and Muslim rulers of Princely states. Hindu Maharaja of Travancore intended to stay independent. So there's no reason to claim that Patel's politics was motivated by religion.  Infact, his outlook towards RSS changed after Gandhi Assassination. Even though the ties between RSS and Gandhi Assassinations were never proved, he was of the opinion to ban it along with Hindu Mahasabha. 

----

A reader called me to accuse that ""your favourite JRD had said, if Sardar Patel had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today"". I spoke with him and by the end of the call he had change of heart. Why? Let's see.

History tells us that Gandhi's economic policies were opposed by Nehru and Patel and two of them also had difference of opinion about it. Nehru's economic policies had layer of naive socialism. Which gave birth to state-owned enterprises. It spread so much that goverment was making wristwatches. Nationalization was core of his economic policies. It's as if he hated the idea of profit. 

JRD and Nehru had disagreement about this point. JRD was of the opinion that it's not government's job to run airline company. It should be noted that JRD's favourite child, Air India was nationalized by Nehru. Patel agreed with JRD on opinion that businesses should be left to businessmen. JRD's opinion was in this context, ""if Sardar Patel was a younger mand and had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today""

Now the caller didn't take into account Patel's health. Nor did JRD speak about Nehru's popularity and politics. His only focus for comparison was economy.

Now let's come to present. Nehru's economic policies were criticised by many political parties, including the one currently in power. The criticism includes inefficieny, irresponsibilty, unnecessary hirings and expenses etc. 

Narasimha Rao took stand against this love for state-owned enterprises. Him and Manmohan Singh opned the doors for economic liberalization. Rao was throughly Congressman. But he didn't hesitate to throw policies of his predecessor in the can. Atal Bihari's government came close to Rao's. He pushed privatization and sold state enterprises operating at loss. As a member of BJP he had right to can Nehru. 

Now Vaypayee's party came to power in 2014. This part is business-friendly and progressive. So it was a given that PSU's will get evem more freedom. Sins of Congress had resulted in loss in banks, air india, and other state enterprises. The BJP's admiration for Patel meant that even more economic improvements would be done. As a sign of their admiration, this goverment decided to build a monument for Patel. So far Congressis had ignored Patel so these people decied to build a statue so tall, you could not ignore it. That's how you pay tribute to your heros!

Around 3000 crores Rupees were spent for this glorious monument. Who paid for it? The caller didn't know. 

So this is the list of generous people who contributed to this monument, in Rupees:

- Indian Oil - 900 Crores

- Oil and Natural Gas Commission - 500 Crores

- Bharat Petroleum - 450 Crores

- Hindustan Petroleum - 250 Crores

- Oil India - 250 Crores

- Gas Authority of India - 250 Crores

- Power Grid - 125 Crores

- Gujrat Mineral Development Corporation - 100 Crores

- Engineers India - 50 Crores

- Petronet India - 50 Crores

- Balmer Lawrie - 6 Crores

Does the list ring any bell? All of these are Government owned companies. Who were born because of Nehruvian economics and policies,  which was opposed by Sardar Patel. And his monument is now funded by the same companies.

And the money comes from Corporate Social Responsibility funds of these companies, even written down for preservation ofr arts and culture by some of them.

Who is preserving whose which legacy? Food for thought.",5

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

The Rice of Wrath: How Obscure British Land Law and Free Electricity Created Economic Stagnation and Environmental Disaster in Punjab [Policy],22,86w3s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/86w3s1/the_rice_of_wrath_how_obscure_british_land_law/,16,1521955375.0,"Punjab has been the breadbasket of India since the colonial era. The British recruited heavily from rural Punjab for it’s armed forces, and recognized that is was vital to keep rural Punjab prosperous and satisfied. The government invested heavily in irrigation and enacted laws favorable to farmers. Famine nearly struck Bihar and Maharashtra in the after independence, and the new government was desperate to raise agricultural yields. The government of India embraced the Green Revolution, and no region more than Punjab. Punjab led India in the adoption of high value seeds, irrigation and fertilizer. An entire policy regime was constructed to benefit farmers and to increase food production.
However, this policy regime is misfiring badly today. The Green Revolution is over in Punjab, and the state is struggling to reorient itself in an economy where agriculture is no longer paramount. Free electricity to farmers to keep pumps running constantly, causing the water table to drop to dangerous levels while starving the state government of the funds necessary to modernize the economy. Today’s podcast episode is about the weight of history on economic development in Punjab and the struggle to transition from the successes of the Green Revolution to a truly modern economy.",5

Is this sarcasm? I mean, most of the things mentioned in this article are detrimental to the common man. Highlights include:

* Growth in rural wages has been curtailed. This ensures that the reserve army of the underemployed continues to exert a downward pressure on wages.
* The ruling party’s ideology of religious nationalism has the merit of distracting the attention of the masses waiting impatiently for the fruits of development to trickle down. The hard work put in by the ruling party’s grassroots organizations has done much to steer away the poorer castes and classes from militant demands that interfere with the process of capital accumulation. As the Roman satirist Juvenal said, it is necessary to provide both bread and circuses to the masses.
* The presence of a strong charismatic leader is a big help in developing an anti-liberal mass base and ensuring right-wing policies are implemented. The government has done its best to neutralize the left wing and has placed its nominees in crucial positions in important institutions. Recall that all the East Asian miracle economies had their growth spurts under autocratic governments.

The identity crisis of Middle India,134,63dbev,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63dbev/the_identity_crisis_of_middle_india/,185,1491330951.0,"It is often said of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, that he was the last Englishman to rule India. The saying carries some element of truth to it. Nehru may have been born in Allahabad, but his heart lay in the Shires and Oxbridge. This showed through in his language, cultural sensibilities, and overall, the parliamentary democracy that he guided us towards. He was a towering intellect, but unlike his contemporaries who were by and large bilingual intellectuals, his writings were mainly in English. He could give a speech in Hindi, but his knowledge of the tongue ended there. His sensibilities were English and it is to his credit that being so English and upper class as he was, he could mingle with just about anyone from the classes or the masses in a country as diverse as India.

One of Nehru’s primary concerns at Independence was the building of a national identity. India, under the British, was a loose confederation of states that recognized the paramountcy of the British and its people subscribed to only a vague sense of ‘Indian-ness’ that was never formally defined. Nor was such a definition even required. The Tamil in the far south was as unconcerned with the Punjabi in the far north, as was the Bengali with the Gujarati. As far as the common man was concerned, they mainly subscribed to more or less the same set of cultural values. There really was no concept of a political union called India. Indeed, the idea of a country called India, was born with independence and the dissolution of the British raj. However, the dissolution of the British Raj also brought with it partition and all its communal horrors. The lack of a common identity between the Hindu and the Muslim tore once harmonious communities apart. Nehru and his contemporaries realized that the fabric that held this nation together was frayed at the edges and would soon tear apart. It was of utmost importance, therefore, to cultivate a common identity of Indian-ness, and suppress any alternate cultural or regional identity.

We have all been part of this identity formation, whether it took the form of singing the national anthem every morning at school, or by learning the names of various and far flung rivers of the nation. And by and large, we have succeeded. A Tamilian today cheers for “Enga thalai Dhoni”, a man from Ranchi, Jharkhand with as much fervor as the Punjabi, the Bengali or the Gujarati. A common identity has been built and there is little talk of separatism in the Indian heartland. What separatism exists has literally been pushed to the fringes of the nation and is on the verge of fizzling out itself. The political unification of India has been a success.

Culturally though, we remain as diverse as ever, and a unified identity is something that is neither attainable nor desirable. In many areas of India, language remains a prickly subject and it is quite common to hear diatribes against linguistic minorities and those who do not speak the language native to the area they stay in. However, even this problem of communication has been resolved by that great gift of Empire, the English language. If two people from any of the country’s opposite extremes were to converse, they would use the English language to great effect. Indeed, this has even resulted in an amalgamated language called ‘Inglish’ which has created a cultural identity and linguistic space of its own.

Socially too, we are as diverse and it must be said, as divided as ever. Perhaps more so in the present than at any time in the past, near or ancient. India has always had a divided society. The caste system effectively divides us into haves and have-nots, where the have-nots outnumber the haves by a large sum. The have-nots, by virtue of their numbers are at the bottom of the pyramid, and the haves are right on top. This caste based division of society is often reflected in the economic sphere as well. The upper castes are in most cases, very well off. The lower castes tend to be among the poorer and more downtrodden sections of the society. Consequently the aspirations of the haves are vastly different from the aspirations of those at the lower half of the pyramid. This social pyramid has been the template for every society since the beginning of time. The upper classes, the middle classes and the lower classes are at various times dominant separately, but their composition remains pretty much the same. When the aspirations of one of these classes are not met, a society will experience upheaval. In the case of the lower classes, it is revolution. For the others, this upheaval takes the form of a flight to greener pastures. It is this upheaval that India is facing today.

The Indian state in the past sixty years has done a decent, though by no means complete, job of providing for the basic (and here I must stress on the word basic) aspirations of the lower rungs of the pyramid. The Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has been taken care of for many Indians. Food security was achieved quite a while ago, while our housing situation too has not been too bad. Again, I must remind the reader that there is much to be done, but there has been a good deal of coverage in this area. In the case of the better off citizen of this nation, the Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has always been taken care of. It is something else that he aspires too. These aspirations may take the form of entertainment, social standing, a certain lifestyle or even the choice of clothing. It is a matter of debate as to whether these aspirations have been fulfilled or not. Certainly, the cities of India hold all the ingredients to provide for these aspirations. And yet, it is seen that they do not and the urban youth have flocked to greener pastures abroad like migratory wildebeest. The logical conclusion in this case is that the aspirations of the urban youth have changed and these aspirations are something that Indian society cannot fulfill.

And so what are the aspirations of the urban, educated, elite of this nation? Certainly education and employment is readily available. Admission into an IIT/NIT, or barring that, an educational institute of similar standing is within their reach. A degree in Engineering guarantees every one of them gainful employment with a salary that can ensure a comfortable lifestyle. Some of them go in for a post graduate degree or diploma in management or business administration. A resume containing all this can lead to a very comfortable lifestyle with excellent prospects for any young Indian with an eye on his future. And yet, it is not sufficient to ensure that he or she does not take flight to greener pastures? What then, are the greener pastures that they aspire to?

Everyone has heard of the brain drain of the 70’s and 80’s. Educated Indians fled abroad in huge numbers, stymied by the lack of opportunities in this land. It was a great loss yes, but one could understand why they left. India in those days was in a socialist paroxysm. The license-quota-permit Raj that Nehru set up stifled creativity and business enterprise. Jobs were hard to come by in an economy with a ‘Hindu-rate-of-growth’ and as a result doctors, engineers and scientists fled this country for the US, helping to build societies there. Today however, the nation is better poised to provide employment and opportunities to its engineers and doctors. And yet, they continue to leave in droves. What then, are the opportunities that they are looking for?

Nehru tried hard to build a common identity for this nation. Today, nearly fifty years after his death, it is hard to say if he has succeeded or not. There is a political and cultural union called India. There is also a growing population of youth that hardly even identifies itself with this nation and its people and culture anymore. They identify themselves with the West. And it is in search of this identity, that they surge westwards in increasing numbers every year.

When I asked why they wished to leave this nation, I received many replies.. Some are insightful, some well thought out, and some are purely cynical and selfish, though unbeknownst to the person concerned.

One worshipper of the Western way of rational thought spoke in raptures about their technological and industrial prowess and glowingly described their plans to build a magnetically levitated high speed rail system. He noted that his own nation that had fed, housed and educated him for twenty five years was a “backward shithole that did not invent anything of note”, thus conveniently discarding the fact that it took the United States a hundred years to reach where it is now, while India is still suffering from its birth pangs.

A young lady of my acquaintance described India as a selfish, repressed society of bullies who could not be counted upon to elect a capable Prime Minister. She was “sick of the way we use age old methods that cannot be integrated into modern society, Must it be taught to even respect equally?”. She was right, to an extent. But it is doubtful if she would ever find a society that respects equally, where bullying is not tolerated and is not parochial and narrow minded in some sense. It also took all of my self control to keep from reminding her that Donald Trump has been elected to the most powerful office in the world.

The real reason, one that they are loathe to acknowledge, is that they no longer identify with the people around them anymore. Indeed, the vast majority of Indians are invisible to them and when they do make an appearance in their lives, they are disgusted and feel alienated. They would rather not acknowledge the presence of those whose aspirations are to merely survive, than to sit in a bar the whole day and drink beer and discuss the latest happenings in International politics. Fed on a relentless diet of Americana, they do not identify with Indian events, Indian characters, Indian food, drink or even other Indians anymore. The television shows they watch are American. The food that they eat is American. The books they read are American. The language they are most comfortable with is American. The news channels they are most familiar with show local American news. Indeed, they would know more about the political system of the USA than of their own nation.  The latest agendas of the latest Senatorial candidates would be on their fingertips. What would not be on their minds, is the names of their MP’s and MLA’s back home.

One of the most absurd things I have heard of in recent times is the news that a socialist has been elected to the Seattle city council. That a socialist has been elected in the USA itself is absurd enough. But what makes the news even more absurd is the fact that the candidate who campaigned on a socialist platform was an Indian who was raised in India, was educated in India, was in all likelihood a beneficiary of all the post liberalization reforms of the Government of India. Like everyone else in her generation, she would have been the first to demand reforms and the lifting of India’s socialist policies and yet, when she emigrated to the US, rediscovered the socialist in herself, because she could not bear to see the suffering of the American masses under the yoke of capitalism. It reeks of hypocrisy. Would she do the same thing in India? No. In India, the very same candidate would have triumphantly pointed to the benefits of our liberalization and campaigned for a right wing party, merely because the reforms have benefitted her tiny group of elites who reside on the top of the pyramid at the expense of those at the bottom. But of course, they do not even exist for her. Instead, she chose to fight for the American’s Roti, Kapada, aur Makaan, because – “ It is easier to convince 300 million literate people to vote for you, than to convince 1 billion illiterate people, never mind that they are your own people.”. There is a word to describe such people. It is ‘mercenary’. But then, what can you expect of a people who would rather celebrate Halloween to Holi?

It is easier to convince three hundred million literates to vote for you. It is far more difficult for these people to convince the one billion Indians who are their countrymen to vote for them because they do not even speak their language. Indeed, they do not even make an effort to learn their own mothertongue and identify with the rest of their society. This laziness to push themselves and achieve something points to a deeper malaise in our psyche. In other words, this generation of Indians has ‘Aspirations, but no Ambitions’. They feel apart from the world around them and would rather run away to the West than do anything about the very society that gave birth to them, but cannot satisfy their outsize American aspirations. And why would they not? They are Americans in all but name.

**TL;DR - Our urban youth emigrate because they are culturally American and do not even identify themselves as Indian anymore.**",5
"Debunked: ""Do the maths: India's first bullet train isn't 'free of cost' as Modi claims"" - lazy journalist",97,717dlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/717dlb/debunked_do_the_maths_indias_first_bullet_train/,45,1505895784.0,"The article in question: http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/do-the-math-india-s-first-bullet-train-isn-t-free-of-cost-as-modi-claims-117091800116_1.html

###Scumbag journalist: 

###Writes article saying ""Do the math"". Does no math.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

>Initially, each high speed train will have 10 cars and the capacity to accommodate 750 people, The Times of India said. It will increase to 16 cars that will accommodate 1,200 people.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

Is import substitution the right policy for India?,1,9n6945,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9n6945/is_import_substitution_the_right_policy_for_india/,0,1539255975.0,"## Against import substitution:

1. Almost all mainstream economics backed by World Bank, IMF is against Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI). So is the current opinion of India [economists](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/LsmVCb9m6adIvafTdQJ4vN/Opinion--Trade-liberalization-folly-From-high-road-to-low.html) on Modi's shift towards ISI.
2. Comparative Advantage: Basically do what you are good at and buy something for cheap if it is available for cheap in the international market. The entire specialization economy is based on outsourcing specialization. This argument says that if India is good at making spices then it should keep making spices, and if India is good at IT then it should keep doing IT. Let France make Rafaels etc.
3. Tariffs attract tariffs: If we put tariffs on other countries' products, they are going to retaliate and tariff our exports. We will suffer.
4. Corruption and local monopolies: Brazil's semi-conductor industry example and India's car industry example show that protectionism does not necessarily lead to rise of globally successful industries.

## For import substitution
The main arguments comes from Ha-Joon Chang in his book Bad Samaritans.

1. According to Ha-Joon Chang, both Britain and USA used protectionist trade policies during their period of rapid industrialization and when they had good stable industries, then decided to ""liberalize"" themselves and every one else. The same is true for South Korea, Japan and China.
2. Comparative Advantage theory by Riccardo is based on the assumptions of free-flow of labor and restricted-flow of capital. The current ""globalized"" word is opposite, the capital can flow freely while the labor is restricted by passsports and visas. Moreover, the comparative advantage theory does not take into account the long term human development like education and health that might result from development of local industry. This is equivalent of the idea that if you won't go to college and start driving Uber after high school, then you will always drive Uber because you have a ""comparative advantage"" in driving skills than others.
3. Tariffs arguments: I think this is a valid argument, but if China can do it, then India can too. The tariffs are a part of the diplomatic process, we should balance it with other diplomatic processes.

"Understanding the Petro Dollar, its possible decline, Fiat Currencies and how it all affects India and Why maybe it's time to look elsewhere to hold foreign reserves.",53,6z7u08,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6z7u08/understanding_the_petro_dollar_its_possible/,45,1505073041.0,"The whole thing came up recently during some discussions I had about why people use the dollar for international trade and what would happen if the major economies of the world just stopped using the Dollar. What is the Impact of BRICS. Why US has so many wars in the middle east and they are supposedly for oil but they never really take over any oil. How US is so rich to have 800 military bases around the world with a defence budget larger than the rest of the world combined. About why countries still hold US dollar reserves when US is in trillions of dollars of debt and being in so much debt, how is US economy still afloat? So I thought of putting it together here for myself and anyone else who may want to learn about this. Now, this is what I have gleaned from my reading on the matter. I am no economist so if anyone wants to correct me on anything, I would be welcome to accept the criticism with reference material substantiating your point.

 in 1944, all the countries entered into the Bretton Woods Agreement which basically said that all of the world’s currrecies would be backed by the US Dollar and the US dollar would be backed by gold and any country could convert their currency into US dollars and then redeem US gold in exchange for that at the rate of 35 dollars per ounce of gold. Since US had the largest gold reserves at the time (75% of the entire world's gold), everyone agreed. This also allowed US treasury to fix exchange rates of dollar into different currencies and set the interest rates for interbanking transactions etc. However, the multiple wars of the US during the ’60s caused domestic inflation in the US and the value of Dollar to fall. This caused panic in all the countries and they started redeeming gold from US treasury. The US gold fell from 20,000 tonnes to 8100 tonnes very quickly. Thus, in 1971, Nixon closed the gold window i.e. he suspended the ability of any nation to redeem US gold against dollars and took the gold backing off of the US Dollar. While that allowed US to retain its gold reserves, it made the need of the US dollar among other countries non existent. So everyone started to move away from the Dollar. After that, US economy started to spiral and the price of gold became 135 dollars per ounce. On top of that, the Arab world hiked the oil prices. Now, the US desperately needed to stabilize the spiral. So they brokered a deal with the Saudis that the oil producers would not only trade oil in nothing but US Dollars and convince the OPEC (the middle eastern, north African and other oil producing countries) to do the same but also invest their (OPEC’s) oil profits in US treasury by buying US Treasury bonds. This basically means that they (OPEC) are buying out US debt. Not only this, US is printing Dollars against the amount of Foreign investments in the US treasury which is made by Oil producing nations which are their oil profits. So basically, profits from every barrel sold by OPEC make way to the US treasury and become the value against which dollars is printed. Ultimately, more the profits in oil, stronger the dollar and lesser the profits in oil, weaker the dollar. Thus US gets a double benefit out of every barrel of oil in a way. In exchange the US would sell them (Saudis) advance weapons and all the gold they demanded. (So basically weapons and gold sale in exchange for trading oil in dollars props up US dollar. Gold is still propping up US dollar indirectly by forcing the oil producers to trade in dollars). Thus the petrodollar was born. This caused the world to need US dollar again. If you wanted to buy oil, you needed US dollar by either converting your currency or by selling stuff to the US. The latter is more preferred as it is cheaper than exchanging your currency and also grows your economy. So once again, US became the benchmark of international trade since no country can hope to grow its economy without using energy aka oil and you can’t have oil without US dollars. As long as all these countries need oil, US can just print Dollars out of thin air and balance it against oil barrels (as explained above) without actually even owning a single drop of oil. (Other countries need to own the gold that they balance their currency against). US does not need to control oil, they just need to control the currency it is traded in to keep their economy afloat. (more on that later in US foreign policy). Similarly, US bokered a deal with the Latin American countries to not only trade in the US Dollar but also to give precedence to US, EU and Japanese products in trade. So if more and more countries decide to shun the dollar and trade in other currencies, this would eventually cause OPEC to switch as well and Dollar could collapse.

How? Well, US is basically just printing enormous amounts of money out of thin air. This money is being used domestically and to a much larger extent, globally. If international oil trade in dollar stops, people stop needing the dollar and use their own currency. So all the internationally circulating dollars would come back to US. Now that is just too many dollars against very little amount in the treasury and that would cause hyperinflation and economic spiral. However, the logical next step would be to just destroy the excess dollars coming in from abroad and that would keep the country’s economy afloat. While that is okay but remember, what is the dollar being printed against? The foreign investments in the treasury which are the profits from the oil trade in dollars. That would go away as well essentially leaving nothing in the treasury against which the dollar is valued. Hence dollar will literally not be worth the money it is printed on.

Second, since US currency is basically a petrodollar, its power depends on the control of oil. So right now, whoever controls middle east has major power. Today, Saudi Arabia controls Middle East and US controls Saudi Arabia. US-Saudi brotherhood sort of makes it impossible for other countries to have an influence over this. Russia has tried for decades to establish a strong foothold in the middle east but has been unsuccessful. It has also dictated the US foreign policy far the last 5 decades. Like I said, US needs to control not the oil reserves but the currency oil is traded in. Hence all the wars we hear that were for oil, were not actually for oil per se but intimidation tactics against countries that announced that they would no longer accept dollar as a currency in international oil trade. Egs When the Ayatollah of Iran announced their intention to denounce dollars in oil trade and use their own currency instead, US backed Iraq to go to war with Iran and even provided the Weapons of mass destruction to use on Iran that they later used as an excuse to invade Iraq and prosecuted Saddam Hussein for. When Iraq invaded Kuwait ( a major producer of oil) to be able to pay their loans to Kuwait and then later asked for Euro to be used for oil trade rather than Petrodollar, US invaded Iraq. When Gaddafi asked gold based Dinar instead of US dollars for oil trade, US invaded Libya. When Chavez did the same, Us staged a coup in Venezuela. However, starting a non-petro currency would break this link and oil and Middle east would become less relevant for Economic power and only be of interest for energy concerns. It is still important but less so than a economic and geopolitical chessboard of US that it is today. It may actually be a solution to achieving peace in the middle east.

However, another thing that happens is Middle East controls prices of oil which is tied to the Dollar. Recently, the Middle East (OPEC or basically Saudi Arabia) has decided to drop the international prices for their own economic reasons. Now, the countries that have oil production as a major source of revenue and trade in dollars eg many N African countries, Venezuela have seen their economy completely stabilise and destroyed. These countries are sick of US and Saudi controlling the markets in a way that affects other countries adversely. Hence, for these countries, switching to the international trading system of a gold based currency will cause their economies to stabilise.

The international reserves of EU etc, on the other hand have seen increased holdings by the OPEC countries and have been worried of increasing power of these countries in the international banking system. They would be only to glad to get rid of these holdings.

Now, non Dollar currency would cause a fall in the US dollar value. In lieu of that, here is another thing that needs to be considered. A lot of the developing countries have international trade deficits. Now these trade deficits can be in the currency of the country to whom the debt is owed or any other internationally accepted currency eg. the Dollar. If the debt is in dollars, the conversions and interest rates of borrowing are determined according to the rules of the US treasury. Again, the rates in the US treasury are linked to the value of dollar. Most countries giving out loans prefer to do so in dollars as historically the Dollar is strong and trusted not to collapse and hence the money they owe is safe. The countries taking loans also convert their debts to dollars as it is easier and the country to whom the debt is owed cannot just up and change the value of the debt owed by manipulating their currency as dollar has determined the conversion into other currencies at fixed rates, so it is safe for everyone. However, there is a slight problem with this. If you owe a debt of 1 dollar to someone, when you pay the debt, it will depend on the value of dollar to your currency at that particular instant. So if dollar has gotten stronger wrt to your currency, you shall have to pay more money and if the dollar has gotten weaker, you will owe less money in your currency. Hence the fall of the dollar would be beneficial for the countries who owe debt in dollars and bad for the countries who have loaned out debt in dollars.

Also, taking debt in dollars becomes cheaper if the value of dollar falls since the US treasury interest rates are directly tied to dollars, hence it becomes cheaper to borrow in dollars. Also, as I said, if it grows weaker still, yo will owe less money.

One more thing to consider regarding fall of the Dollar is this. Uptil now, the oil producers have been buying US treasury bonds due to the Bretton Woods deal. Other countries and US and other corporations do so too. Now, the US treasury gives a fixed rate of interest to those investing in the treasury. This rate, in turn is linked to the value of the dollar. Stronger the dollar, more the interest on US Treasury bonds and more the foreign countries invest in it. Now this means that these foreign countries would much rather invest their money in US Treasury at an assured fixed rate of interest than invest it in 3rd world countries and take a risk of maybe losing it. However, if the value of dollar were to fall, the countries would much rather draw out of the US treasury and invest more in the startups in different countries, domestically etc.

The other side of the same coin would be the countries dependent on US investment. Should the value of the dollar fall, the investment being received from the US would be of a lesser value.

On the other hand, there is one more thinh. Like I said, investments in dollars are governed by the US treasury rules. Now, basically, US banks have cut the taxes on money transfer and conversion, artificially keeping them very low to fuel the domestic and world trade etc . If the dollar were to collapse, people wouldn’t trade in dollars. They would trade in other currencies. The inetrbanking across the world would be then governed by the rules of the currency you trade in, for eg, BRICS nations will follow the tariffs etc of the Shanghai Bank where most of the reserves are held. So that effect would then depend on the rules of the bank you deal with and that can be detrimental or beneficial depending on the bank’s policies compared to the dollar.

Also, countries having holdings in the US treasury would lose the entire value of their foreign reserves. On the other hand coountries like BRICS who have their reserves in other international banks would retain the value of their foreign reserves in those banks.

What does this mean?

Indian Currency would also fall with the fall of the dollar in its current state. Now, we usually run around with the perception that Indian currency is backed by gold, That’s not true. The truth is 99% of today’s currencies US Dollar, Euro, Indian rupee, all of them are fiat currencies i.e. their value is not determined by the gold they hold but by the economic strength of the government. Only an average of 4–7% of any country’s currency is today, backed by gold. US Dollar - 4.5%, Indian rupee - 5%. The rest is held in the terms of foreign reserves in other countries like in the form of US Dollar (around 70%) in US treasury bonds, in world bank or IMF, in other currencies (around 25%) in BRICS and other foreign reserves etc. Currently if you have rs 1000 , only rs 50 is gold, around 670 is held in the form of US dollars and Rs 280 in other currencies. You might ask why is that? Well, remember the Bretton Woods agreement. At that time US had 75% of the world’s gold which backed dollar and dollar backed other currencies so most of the currency of any country was backed directly or indirectly through dollar by gold. Now, it is difficult to keep gold in your country so it was convenient for other countries to just hold foreign reserves in dollars especially with the fixed exchange rates they provided. Hence more and more portion of their currency was being held in dollars. However, after Nixon shock of 1971, dollar removed its gold backing. So, automatically all other currencies that were backed by dollar (99% of the world currencies) also became fiat currencies as a result. However, the dollar was still good and trusted so no one thought much of it, especially since dollars were being printed out of thin air. However, now with the prospect of the trust in dollar fading, this as started to worry some experts. Because of the senseless printing of dollars and in exchange all the fiat currencies, the total amount of currency can nowhere near be compensated by the gold reserves even if all the gold in the world was put together. It would form not more than 10% of the currency in the world. Now, putting this disturbing detail aside, if Dollar were to collapse, 670 rupees of your 1000 would become worthless, too. So, it isn’t wise to hold US dollars, is it? No its, not and many countries have woken up to that fact.

China has been secretly amassing large amounts of gold. OPEC countries have started removing their capital from US treasury. See, these oil producers have been receiving US gold in exchange for trading oil in US dollars and have accumulated holdings in other countries’ treasuries. Now with all the crazy gold they have received they have bought material assets like real estate etc even in other countries. Now, they can simply sell out their US treasury bonds and buy more assets such as gold and real estate from it, which they have been doing in the recent years. Now, this will start depleting the treasury and cause the fall in the value of the dollar in turn causing other countries to withdraw and invest elsewhere. That, coupled with Russia and China doing trade in Roubles and Yuan, India and Iraq trading oil outside of dollar, Germany and China trading outside of Dollar, the strenghtening of BRICS bank etc, Dollar has been showing a steady decline. So India should also wisen up and start replenishing its treasury with gold and sell off holdings in dollars and euros and invest in other currencies on the rise. This is one reason BRICS could be very important for India and other countries in BRICS whether we like it or not. 

Another thing that using another currency would do, it would take away the power of the US to slap economic sanctions on whichever country they choose. This is one of the major reasons Putin has teamed up with China - in order to bypass US sanctions.

*[Edit: The thing that worries most nations is this - having international trade and foreign reserves in dollars gives US a single handed say on their economies. Just like Nixon's unilateral decision changed the fate of all currencies, other decisions by it can also change their economies. US can dictate their rules and if you don't follow them - sanctions. So the countries want to take back the power of making decisions in their own hands.*

*Next, the petrodollar is based on a commodity that is being depleted. Oil reserves are declining and the world is moving towards other sources - gree energy, nuclear energy etc. So the petrodollar decline is destined. However, what would US do next? They could shift to backing their currency with nuclear reserves or some new crazy idea out of someone's hat. That will, inevitably affect all other countries and they want to and should have a say in it.]*

On the other hand, China's attempt to start a gold backed currency may not pan out because like I said all the gold in the world is not sufficient to back all the currencies in the world. Also, since most currencies still have a large amount of dollar backing, fall of the dollar would make that percent of the currency valueless and therefore even having a reserve in another foreign currency could still cause a fall in Indian currency though it might be a little mitigated. On the other hand, fiat currencies are run by the investors' trust in the currency. So even if the dollar falls, a fiat currency with foreign reserves in the dollar may not fall because the confidence in that currency is still high. Sadly, such a currency would be Chinese Yuan. So, the policy to fix this? I am still trying to work on that solution. This is a post in evolution. My thoughts on this are still in evolution and I would really like some economists to come and hold a serious, well informed and sane discussion on this.

 I will add more when other points occur to me or are brought forward to me in any online or offline discussions.

My experience with the answers of Quora on Government,68,749dxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/749dxv/my_experience_with_the_answers_of_quora_on/,29,1507164159.0,"Before 2014 I was a daily user of quora but once they started there selfless work of promoting government for each and everything and when the crowd of wannabe top writer started throwing senseless answers on stupid question after taking weed. I was forced to quit. But I didn't unsubscribe from Quora digest.

Every alternate week I see there is a question on work related to government in Quora digest. And despite knowing what kind of answer it is going to have 7 out of 10 times, I try to read that. 
I have seen it all from giving them a little bit of time to proving how good demonetization was. 

There is usually a pattern in answers if the question is normal one like, how Modi is performing in his constituency then typically top response have this pattern. 
First, he will put a discloser why he eligible for giving this answer it could be, the writer himself belongs to the same constituency to he visited this place twice, one before 2014 and one after 2014. After that discloser,  couple of pictures from Varanasi in the night from the perfect angle where you can't see the filth. And with that, he will assure you that   Varanasi is literally transformed into a world-class city. Despite the well-known fact that Varanasi is not just restricted to Ghats of Ganga rest of the answer will focus on that, and there will be a rosy picture in front of you. The list put in front of you will mostly a daily news article like Modi gave a gift of x crore to Varanasi and there was a project that started only by great leader etc. Now, what would you expect from a guy who lives there is to put a picture of how his life is changed like electricity, roads and healthcare facility, he is getting after 2014, but no I will throw every random project news about Varanasi without the follow up on that project. Are bahi! ager news article ki project started or gifted vali news headline hi padhni thi to question kyu puchta. 

Another instance if the question is about the health of the economy or something like demonetization. Where people are vocal means, there is less excuse to make. Then ignoring all the facts on how government changed his stance from the attack on black money to increasing cashless transaction. The writer will simply put forward his own theory or a new theory produced by Sir Sambit Patra. One of the theory was now the government have a big database of people who submitted their money it will be easy peasy Japanesey to find defaulters. In the end, there will be some statement from hotshot banking firm head backing their theory and proving how India is headed toward glorious future. Despite the well-known fact how crores of money renewed through bank staff as well as through traveling agencies, daily wage workers, and jan dhan account.  

There are some instances where they pull legs on failed policies like make in India and poor river health but don't know how they forget the name of our beloved PM and his party in that answer. It's all about how bad Indian citizen then. If river Ganga is still filthy then only people are responsible about that because they throw religious material in it. But they closed eyes when Mr. Modi along with his fellas dropped religious stuff in the river during the live telecast of Narmada dam inauguration. 

Justification on how it is just cow cow and cow everywhere is simply it is not new, and it is going on from ages. It was Nehru who started all this. And our beloved leader is so good he never question his elders work. Then why would he question work of Chacha Nehru? He is just following his footstep.

Justification on why farmers are dying and rape is a big problem is again it is not new, and the X country is actually a top-ranked country in this. Just don't dare to question our leader.
One of the top writer and flag bearer of Indian diaspora on Quora said something amazing when asked why they act like the lawyer of government. 

> For the same reason Sachin, Steve Jobs and a variety of people are staunchly defended by their fans. You might not have agreed with every one of Sachin’s shots [especially the silly shots he got out] but would desert him for that?
Modi was elected by crores of voters. Some of these might have voted because they thought there is no alternative. But, there is a sizeable chunk of voters who voted because they believed. They believe this government is theirs and not some random entity like we have often behaved in the past.
If you assume Modi’s string of victories in state elections is a fluke and that a sizeable chunk of people don’t truly adore him, you don’t understand the evolving Indian politics.
In a way this is democracy - where people feel ownership in the government. Look at US politics and the same happens - where common people feel ownership and stake in politics and fight for their ideology.
When you believe it is yours, you will fight for it. 

Yeah, I will fight for it, and I will fight for every single penny I gave through tax and different types of cess. And question government why things don't change instead of supporting them for each and every idiotic move.",5
[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,160,66u52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,82,1492863549.0,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",5

However as of now I don't see that happening. What I see happening however is China's autocratic leadership isn't able to squash it's own people. Which leads to social and political unrest causing an economic slowdown. This will take 30-40 years at the minimum. At this point though, India is large enough an economy that it starts taking over the mantle from China about Asian leadership. And genuinely rises in influence and power to be called a superpower. Do you see that happening? And which factors will actually hasten this process? Some dramatic changes in policy? Takeover from an authoritarian regime (some would argue we're in one right now)?

   Damn it,guys,sorry for the long rant,Baccardi Limon is gold.

   Edit - statistic.
 
   Edit 2  -thanks for the gold kind stranger,it would have been great you know if you would have just up voted my post,and give that gold amount to some disabled folks in your vicinity,yes I have used the term 'disabled'.

   Now you may ask which disabled people you are talking about,I am talking about those who are most affected with this system of ours,for example while I was in my E-Resource of college there was this lady sweeping through the floor,you can literally see the broom movement expressing her grief and her dis-interest,at that time I was on some thread on this sub reading a comment by some guy on how worse is the situation of the lower rung class of the economy the workers.
   
   I thought why not just take a Rs 10 out of my purse and hand it to her,I know the amount was not big,but that's the best I could have done since I was running short of money as well,meanwhile the old lady just burst out with tears,its like she was going through a anxiety drive in her mind and suddenly this gesture of mine struck hard on her she took the Rs 10 note and said how bad the situation was for her that the college management gave her the month salary of mere Rs 1500 and that too on Rs 500 notes,the expression with which she told me sent a shiver down my spine,I was in existential crisis for a span,so much we have as a humans,so much tech,with the given advancements,the basic necessities for every individual of the earth can be covered,I started questioning the universe,how a Rs 10 note is a gram worth of weed for me but a vital sum for the under-privileged.
   
   the gold will provide me with me with less ads,better themes and shit-ton of other features,but the same amount will fill the light in some low rung homes,I am not trying to criticize this good gesture of yours but it would be cool if you find some under-privileged folk and provide them with necessities worth the gold,I can manage with ads and white theme,just my 2cents.

I fully supported demonetization when it happened but now it has started to feel like a scam!,110,5hp22k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5hp22k/i_fully_supported_demonetization_when_it_happened/,156,1481470780.0,"I'm not affiliated to any polarizing ideology of the sides that are fighting a tug of war now. But here are my observations so far. These are just my opinion and experiences and may not represent the whole situation accurately

* On Nov 8^th I was pretty happy that the government did it, as I was naive to the whole economy thing I thought it was an ingenious idea to get rid of all the black money

* I was still resistant after a week when 30+ uncles started complaining (note: these were the same uncles & aunties that praised Modi up and down on 9/11 and so did I as a matter of fact )

* Even after 3 weeks i wasn't affected as i was able to withdraw 2000 and 2500 on different occasions quite easily (funny stories btw, first time i walked in to a random ATM where i saw a bunch of people doing something to the ATM machine, i just stood in front of the door and was watching what they were doing, after couple of minutes they looked at me and made a gesture to come in, and when i went the guy in Khaki(idk if he was police) told me i can draw cash now, I proceeded and gave the amount as 400, the Gurkha looked at me weirdly and said the limit was 2000, I couldn't process at the moment what he was saying and thought may be only 2000's notes were there. So i reentered the amount as 2000 and drew a stack of 20 100s! as i turned back i saw a huge ass mob outside the ATM! with people still running towards it as i was heading out of the area! )

* But then afterwards I started thinking if black money was actually eradicated? Then it dawned on me, **This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!**

* Think about it. Most of the taxes come from the working middle class people in our country. Now from this move a bunch of poor people have been included to the tax roster, let's be honest, the rich have already been avoiding taxes very intelligently and they wouldn't shell out a paisa no matter how the rules get stricter. Thanks to all the private CA guys who never  made it.

* Then modi announced about releasing records of transactions from his party members **After** 8/11. **BUT** , wouldn't they have already took measures Before 8/11... if we want to be honest here, we should check on ALL politician transactions at least five years prior to this.

* What about black money in the form of foreign currencies? To the uninformed people, Switzerland is NOT the only tax haven in the world, so who ever did have swiss accounts, would've probably switched to somewhere else. So we're not getting that money either.

* All this whole fiasco did was, bringing bunch of poor people in to Tax radar, But they earn so less, we can't actually tax them.

* But i do have a proposal though, we can efficiently use the tax money and skyrocket india's progress, but the people of india needs to involve with the policy making at the root level like people of denmark and some other baltic states do. All we have to do is to have a system where the government still collects taxes but is unable to use the money without the tax payers approval and should give them details for every paisa used.

* people should be given the power of choosing where their tax money is invested into, A nice swimming pool for a minister's residence?: Not gonna give my money.  A public toilet and a public high rise parking lot?: Shut up and take our money.

* But how would we the ^^busy people keep involved in all these process? Well, just like wester countries have Jury duties , india should have a taxer duty, where a group of people are selected from the people investing in a project and are sent to negotiate the process, these people should be non-government citizens and nobody gets to go twice from the same group or similar duration. During that period the taxers should be given paid leaves from their jobs and shouldn't be deducted from their privileged accounts.

* I'm tired now and can't type anymore, but this is my argument. **demonetization was done to bring people under tax watch, but the people we needed in tax watch evaded it any way, this whole scenario was masqueraded as a fight against corruption, which won't stop, but we can smarten up now and demand accountability for our tax money before it gets devoured by our ridiculous politicians and the bureaucracy, because, INDIA!**

India bullying Bhutan?,44,6q4rou,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6q4rou/india_bullying_bhutan/,36,1501286687.0,"I came across this post in my FB feed where a Bhutanese woman was criticising India in an International Relations forum. It is a great read and a different perspective altogether. It would be great if you guys can share your views on the post. 

WARNING - Long wall of text

------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHO IS BULLYING BHUTAN?

On 26th June 2017, The Times of India posted a video on YouTube claiming to show Chinese and Indian troops jostling and shoving each other on what The Times commentator said is “Indian land” on the “Indian side” of the Sikkim border. He accused China of “aggression” and the Chinese troops of being “extremely aggressive.”

A few days later, it emerged that the dispute had nothing to do with Indian land. The China-India confrontation was taking place on the China-Bhutan border. Yet Chinese and Indian media quickly roused patriotic fervour and railed against each other.

Chinese media said India would be “kicked out”, “taught a bitter lesson” and “suffer greater losses than in 1962. One Chinese editorial mocked India’s claim to be defending Bhutan and accused India of treating Bhutan as a “vassal state” and forcing it to support India.

Meanwhile an Indian headline read: “China: The World’s Bully”, and another article called China “a geopolitical bully….The mere fact that a vastly bigger country like China is indulging in such antics against a peaceful neighbour like Bhutan shows the extent to which Beijing will stoop to, to occupy territory illegally, slicing it off like a salami, just like it's done with India.”

Through such welter of mutual recriminations and accusations, Bhutan’s media remained remarkably quiet and reserved, with “no aggressive posturing”, as reported by the Hindustan Times. And why should there be? The vast majority of Bhutanese have no interest in the remote, barren, high altitude Doklam Plateau, and have not even heard of it.

But the 89 sq.km. parcel does have strategic importance to India that sees Chinese presence there as a “dagger” pointed at its narrow and vulnerable 21-km wide “chicken’s neck” that links it to its northeastern states. And so, Bhutan’s initial quiet restraint was not good enough for India, and Bhutan quickly fell into line.
On 3rd July FirstPost headlines read: “Bhutan vents out first major disclaimer against Chinese, sides with India…” The article went on to say: “Bhutan, for the first time has taken a major stand against China's incursions …. Bhutan's stand against Beijing… goes on to show the country's unwavering alliance and support for big brother India.”
And that characterization itself raises a big question: Who precisely is bullying Bhutan? And what exactly are Indian troops doing on Bhutanese land in the first place? Just defending poor little Bhutan against big China’s bullying “aggression”? Who, in fact, is more seriously threatening Bhutan’s sovereignty and independence – China or India?

When “friendship” turns to control.

In fact, India has maintained a strong military presence throughout Bhutan for half a century, exercising its power and influence in every corner of Bhutanese life. Even in the remote and strategic areas of northern Bhutan, far from anything Indian, Indian soldiers exercise their authority and control the movement of local Bhutanese. Convoys of Indian military trucks travel freely across Bhutan and cannot be checked for contents by the Bhutanese authorities. The Indian army has occupied the Haa Dzong for decades, and has given no indication of handing it back to the Bhutanese. The Dzongs have since the time of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, the founder of Bhutan, been a seat of power and a symbol of governance.
It is noteworthy that Indian troops’ efforts to block Chinese road construction on the Bhutan border are portrayed in Indian media as stopping China from building roads into India – revealing just how little respect the Indians really have for Bhutanese “sovereignty.” But such spin is not surprising. In Bhutan, the IMTRAT (Indian Military Training) General, and Indian Ambassador both residing in the two most prized real estates in the capital, are said to be the most powerful men in the country, even determining what does and does not get published in the national media.

When Bhutan obtained Asian Development Bank funding for a strategic highway linking its east and west, to avoid the necessity of Bhutanese travel through troubled, strike-prone and often violent Assam and West Bengal, India vetoed the plan. The highway was cancelled and Bhutan remains dependent on India’s grace and mercy for its own internal east-west transit. Just a few weeks ago an angry mob of Indians beat up a Bhutanese truck driver and set his truck on fire for being involved in a road accident.
But this Indian interference and infringement on Bhutanese sovereignty extends far beyond the military-strategic sphere into every aspect of Bhutan’s political and economic life.

Thus, Bhutan is the only sovereign independent nation in the world that has no diplomatic relations with any of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members – the US, UK, France, China and Russia – only because India, jealous of its exclusive hegemony over Bhutan and fearful of any competitive influence, won’t allow it.
Japan has long been a friend of Bhutan, helping fund many developmental projects in Bhutan. The Japanese wished to have an embassy in Bhutan, to foster closer ties and more development projects. However, firm plans and agreement to build a Japanese Embassy in Thimphu were abruptly cancelled, once again due to India’s disapproval.

When China invited Bhutan to exhibit at its Shanghai EXPO in 2010, offering a free pavilion that would be a central installation in the EXPO, India forbade Bhutanese participation. Independent sovereign nations from the world over took part in the EXPO sans Bhutan. India, even if they forbade Bhutan, went and participated in the EXPO, even building a pavilion of their own. India regularly nixes Bhutanese official and commercial missions and visits to China, though it conducts its own with impunity, apparently due to Indian disapproval of potential competition with its own overweening influence.

More ominously, India has blatantly interfered in Bhutan’s elections and political processes. India strongly objected to Bhutan’s former Prime Minister forging extensive new diplomatic ties and carving out an independent foreign policy, and was furious when the Prime Minister simply met and talked with China’s Premier at the Rio + 20 conference. And so, India decided to get rid of him.
Just days before the 2013 elections, India removed its subsidies on liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene, thereby doubling and tripling prices on these essential commodities, to signal its disapproval of the existing government. The cynical tactic worked, and a new government far more compliant and obedient to India’s will and interests was elected.

Hydropower – cooperation or colonization?
But the cornerstone of India-Bhutan “cooperation” for three decades has been the hydropower that is a cheap power boon to India’s growing economy, and which accounts for fully 40% of Bhutan’s revenues and 25% of its GDP. Indian financing, which has switched from 70% grant and 30% loan to 30% grant and 70% loan at higher interest rates, is also the direct cause of Bhutan’s escalating debt that has even further deepened Bhutanese dependence on India.

Since, July 2006, when Bhutan and India agreed to develop 10,000 MW of hydropower from ten large projects, the benign sheen of this apparent cooperation has quickly faded as commissioned projects were delayed and costs mushroomed. Costs jumped $US 240 million at Mangdechhu; they doubled at Punatsangchhu–II, and they tripled at Punatsangchhu–I (from $US 500 million to $1.5 billion), and no end in sight.
And those costs obviously don’t include massive environmental damages for which future generations of Bhutanese will pay. A recent report from India documented severe impacts on water bodies and resources, forest and wildlife loss, and heavy pollution. The same report, reinforced by Bhutan’s own government statistics, notes that hydropower has failed to develop local capacity and employment, with most contracts going to Indian companies.
According to the IMF, Bhutan’s government debt now stands at a whopping 118% of GDP up from just 67% six years ago, with India by far the largest creditor, accounting for 64% of Bhutan’s total debt. By comparison, India’s ratio of government debt to GDP is 70% and China’s is 46%. Why does that ratio matter? Because it’s used by investors to measure a country’s ability to make future payments on its debt, thus affecting the country borrowing costs. Higher borrowing costs worsen debt further.

A recent British report on global debt lists Bhutan as one “among 14 other countries that are fast heading towards a debt crisis.” The report details hydropower’s rapid loss of economic viability, and concludes: “Should the hydropower sector’s financial performance continue to deteriorate, Bhutan’s solvency could be threatened.”
How convenient will that be for India? And what conditions will it attach to bailouts and pleas for loan forgiveness?
In this day and age, sovereignty and independence are much more likely undermined by economic than political control, albeit in far more subtle and hidden ways. So, the definition of “bullying” these days must go far beyond the old-fashioned geopolitical border disputes, however minor and insignificant, that still make for good press in TV images of jostling Chinese and Indian soldiers.

Time to ask hard questions – that can’t be publicly asked in Bhutan!

It’s time, if not long overdue, to question how benign India’s intentions are in Bhutan. How much “cooperation” is actually “exploitation” and “domination? And, how much of India’s foreign aid to Bhutan (now nearly $US1 billion a year) actually signifies mounting control and interference on one side and growing dependence and erosion of sovereignty on the other?

But of course, with Indian control of Bhutanese expression and politics, those questions will never be asked in Bhutan’s supposed free “democracy”. Just imagine if Bhutan’s daily Kuensel newspaper or its state-run Bhutan Broadcasting Service radio and television dared to publish this article. Unimaginable! How ironic that India, the world’s largest democracy that prides itself on its own free speech, utterly suppresses it in its “friendly neighbour”.
And here’s another question equally impossible to ask: How might it benefit Bhutan to warm up a bit more to China, and even to establish diplomatic relations with its huge northern neighbour, cooperate economically, and welcome selective Chinese aid and investments in Bhutan’s infrastructure?
After all, our connection with China already goes far beyond the political and economic to a deep cultural and spiritual affinity. For example, Bhutan shares directly with China the profound wisdom, texts and traditions of Mahayana Buddhism. China today is experiencing an unprecedented Buddhist revival that creates a natural and intuitive bond with Bhutan.

In fact, Bhutan is already benefitting directly from the resurgence of Buddhism in China. From one end of Bhutan to the other, from the giant Shakyamuni Buddha statue at Kuensel Phodrang in Thimphu to the giant Guru Rinpoche statue at Takila in Lhuentse, monasteries, temples, ceremonies and rituals are maintained, sponsored and supported through Chinese donations and contributions.

For all the fawning gratitude, praise, and adulation Bhutanese officials regularly heap on India for its “special relations” with Bhutan, what word of acknowledgement or appreciation do these officials ever utter for the steady, quiet Chinese support for our precious Bhutanese culture and traditions? Support, incidentally, that comes with “no strings attached” and no crippling debt burden!!

And this shared culture and tradition is a major reason for the surge in Chinese tourists flocking to Bhutan, now greatly outnumbering tourists from any other country. And while the Chinese all pay top dollar on expensive tourist visas to visit Bhutan, thus making China by far the largest contributor to Bhutan’s tourism industry, Indian visitors come for free, requiring no visa of any kind. Sorry to say this, but ask any hotel owner in the country who their least favourite, least respectful and most troublesome guests are, and they unfailingly say “Indians”.

The Prime Minister of Bhutan has agreed with India and promised to sign the South Asian Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA). This would open up Bhutan to cars from India, Nepal and Bangladesh; further strengthening India’s hold on Bhutan. Just imagine Bhutan’s roads filled with Indian cars, taxis, buses and trucks. Indian tourists would come in busloads, totally over running Bhutan’s carefully planned ‘quality of quantity’ tourism policy that has helped protect Bhutan. Indian presence would increase, Bhutan’s roads would be destroyed by the increased traffic, resulting in more DANTAK presence to come ‘repair and maintain’ the roads, our pristine environment would be destroyed. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister of Bhutan has agreed to sign this agreement, even if the National Assembly of Bhutan has voted against it. Showing how he is willing to do whatever the Indians want.
And despite the absence of diplomatic relations, Bhutan’s commercial relations with China are already quietly flourishing beneath the surface – all the way from yak-herders on Bhutan’s northern borders to Thimphu merchants dependent on Chinese imports, whose quality often far exceeds comparable Indian products.

In short, might Bhutan benefit in more ways than one by slipping away from total domination by one of its neighbours and instead strategically playing off and leveraging China-India competition to its own advantage?
But questions (let alone policies and solutions) like these are an unwritten “no go zone” in Bhutanese politics and media. Indeed, it is a telling mark of the sinister extent and penetration of Indian control and subjugation of Bhutan that no politician or journalist dare touch such questions with a ten-foot pole.

Interestingly, India is unwittingly aided in such suppression of free speech and other human rights by the utter failure of western human rights groups even to notice. Rather the west seems intent on drawing attention to human rights violations in countries like China, which has grown so rapidly into an economic powerhouse that its global reach now threatens western interests. Conveniently for India, it poses no such threat and escapes western scrutiny.

Yes, China may occasionally though very rarely “flex its muscles” in minor border disputes, as India accuses. But compared to Bhutan’s actual ground-level experience and interaction with China, isn’t India’s domination and subjugation of Bhutan far more intrusive, pervasive and insidious, extending into every portion of Bhutan’s social, political and economic fabric?

Are there any Bhutanese out there who dare even to ask?",5

Demolishing Some LCA Tejas Falsehoods,533,4r5hgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4r5hgo/demolishing_some_lca_tejas_falsehoods/,121,1467634432.0,"_""The Tejas is an old design. It has taken 32 long years to develop! And despite being in development for so long, it isn't truly indigenous. Its heart, the engine, is of foreign origin. So are its weapons and some avionics. Furthermore, it is so deficient in its performance, that the Indian Air Force (IAF) wants Rafales/Su-30MKIs/F-16s instead.""_

Every time the Tejas achieves some important milestone, these criticisms are repeated ad nauseum, in the popular media, on Twitter, on internet forums, and at bhel-puri stalls in Jhumritalaiyya. It's infuriating to see an effort of this magnitude, one that has produced [many successes](http://www.ibnlive.com/blogs/india/saurav-jha/the-radiance-of-tejas-a-bright-prospect-for-make-in-india-10879-748651.html), being panned time and again. So I've taken the liberty to put together this handy-dandy LCA Tejas mythbusting guide to counter them.

And without wasting your time any further, I'll jump right in.

**False Argument 1: The Tejas is ""late"". It has been under development for 32 years!**

The figure is technically true, but deprives the narrative of much-needed context. The Tejas’ origins can indeed be traced back to 1983, when the concept of a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) was conceived. However, the IAF did not finalise its air staff requirements (ASRs) until 1985 and initial funding did not come through until 1986. The project definition phase—the phase in which technical requirements are defined and a conceptual design prepared did not end until 1988. The final design was completed in 1990. Full funding was issued only in 1993, after which the development of a prototype commenced in earnest. See [this list of milestones](http://www.tejas.gov.in/history/milestones.html) for reference.

Following several years of delay in the development process—delays that can at least partly be traced back to overly optimistic R&D timeline projections, scope creep, and [US sanctions on India](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-05-31/news/39655783_1_drdo-chief-v-k-saraswat-lca-project) following the 1998 nuclear tests—the Tejas had its first flight in 2001. From then, the project proceeded at a pace that is not too different that of comparable fighter aircraft development programmes worldwide. It is slated to achieve final operational clearance (FOC), the stage at which an aircraft is considered fully ready for squadron service, in early 2017; fifteen years from the date of the first flight. At this time, the it is expected to be ready to carry out multiple functions: beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air combat, short-range dogfighting, and precision ground attack with a variety of guided and unguided weaponry.

That compares well with contemporary fourth-generation fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon and the JAS-39 Gripen. The first technology demonstrator of what would later be called the Typhoon first flew [in 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Eurofighter_Typhoon). The definitive version with an AESA radar is [still not in service today](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/euroradar-nears-flight-test-phase-for-captor-e-on-ty-416564/), 30 years down the line. The Tranche-2 version, which can drop precision bombs and fire BVR missiles, wasn't available [until 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm). Another European fighter, the Swedish Gripen-C, with full-spectrum capabilities, started entering service in 2002, also fourteen years after its first flight. 

The Tejas is about to FOC with all of these capabilities in late 2016. The fact that ADA managed to achieve similar or better timelines with the Tejas after its first flight, that too without the benefit of half a century of experience in building advanced fighters or the industrial ecosystem that enables such high-technology to proceed swiftly, is an achievement that is not given enough credit.

**False Argument 2: Because of the inordinate delays in development, the Tejas is now deficient.**

Just because the development was delayed doesn't mean that the design is the same one from 1983. The IAF updated its requirements quite often and kept demanding additional capabilities throughout the design and development phase. It was a Catch-22 situation: the constant change in requirements kept the design up-to-date, but it also led to several years of delays because of the need to re-design, re-test, and re-certify subsystems after every modification. Off the top of my head, I can remember that the IAF demanded the following modifications pretty late into the program:

* Open avionics architecture.
* Precision bombing capabilities.
* Heavier A2A missiles (R-73 vs R-60).
* Internal EW suite that included a self-protection jammer.
* Inflight refueling
* More capable radar and missiles (LCA Mk-1A)

With these modifications, the Tejas went from being a simple point-defence interceptor to a full-blown (albeit short-legged) multi-role fighter. 

**False Argument 3: The LCA falls short on several performance parameters like empty weight, range, turn rates, etc. The IAF has allowed 53 concessions/permanent waivers in the design.**

Like the 32-year delay, this too is a scary looking quote that paints a false picture of how fighter aircraft programmes work.

First off, it is important to remember that the Tejas can carry out most of the tasks intended of it quite competently. It can fight other aircraft at beyond visual range (when equipped with an AESA radar and Derby/Derby-ER missiles, it could end up becoming _the most capable_ BVR platform in IAF service). The addition of an Israeli helmet-mounted sight coupled to missiles whose seekers have a wide field of view (R-73 and Python IV/V) make it a fearsome dogfighter and compensate for minuscule shortfalls in aerodynamic performance. It can drop laser-guided bombs on ground targets with great precision. It is also very easy to fly. [In the words of the IAF](http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/air-force-drdo-pleased-with-tejas-performance-at-bahrain-116022200321_1.html), the fighter’s ""control harmony is comparable to the best in the world… The intuitive cockpit layout and highly reliable life support systems provide for comfort as well as excellent situational awareness."" There are many such triumphs; too many, in fact, to recount here.

Secondly, _every_ fighter project concludes with specifications that aren't met, or a few deficiencies in performance. It’s never that big of a roadblock to induction in service. And all said and done, 53 is a very small number as far as design concessions go; a pretty small portion of the entire range of capabilities. Even simpler aircraft (like the [C-17]( http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910528&slug=1285732)) enter service with more deficiencies. These are either compensated with using improvements in other areas to offset performance shortfalls, or accepted in the interest of availability for combat. 

Again, I shall go back to the Eurofighter Typhoon to illustrate my point. Remember I mentioned that it first flew in 1986? Twenty-two years later, it [couldn't independently drop a laser-guided bomb](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/01/eurofighter_austere_air_to_ground_what_joy/) on a target with any precision. Basic BVR combat capability was not available until Tranche 2 models were procured [in 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm), 14 years after the first flight. Even in close air combat, its capabilities were decidedly limited. The helmet mounted sight (HMS)—a system that allows the pilot to cue weapons onto an enemy aircraft by simply turning his head and offers a quantum jump in dogfighting capabilities—did not enter service [until 2010](https://www.eurofighter.com/about-us).

The F-35 was hobbled by similar issues (and terrible program management) [for several years](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/joint-strike-fighter-lockheed-martin). It didn't begin to turn a corner until 2012 or so, after which it began rapidly demonstrating some of the capabilities that were expected of it.

The companies running these projects were aero giants with decades of experience behind them. How then does one expect the ADA, which has never developed a fighter in its entire existence, to deliver a more capable product while experiencing fewer failures? 

Thirdly, the IAF itself works with deficient designs all the time. The Gnat and Su-7, both hobbled by short ranges and limited payloads, were procured in large numbers. The MiG-21, when initially inducted, was underwhelming. Its range was limited and its missiles didn't work. The Bison is still riddled with issues. The Jaguar had a deficient nav-attack suite. It was practically useless in the long range strike role until the IAF and HAL developed and implemented the [DARIN upgrades](https://tkstales.wordpress.com/2010/03/07/the-darin-story/). The MiG-27's navigation system [never performed satisfactorily](http://www.livefistdefence.com/2010/07/special-report-story-of-indias-mig-27.html), and its reliability was terrible. But none of this troubled the IAF. Why then is the LCA failing to achieve a handful design parameters something to raise a huge hue and cry about?


**False Argument 4(a): The LCA isn't really indigenous. Many of its subsystems are of foreign origin.**

But many more of its critical subsystems are of Indian origin too! The first one that comes to mind is the carbon-fibre composite airframe. It is a very high-end product that reduces weight (thus permitting the carriage of a substantial external payload), aids maintenance, brings down manufacturing time, and so on. The fact that some of the technology involved in its manufacture has been exported to Airbus is a testament to its success.

Another example is the digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system, developed from scratch by ADA scientists in India after their work, notes, and equipment was impounded by Lockheed Martin in 1998. No country on earth, not one, has developed such a complex system and gotten it to work perfectly on the first try. It works so well that when it was first tested on an F-16XL in the US (this was before the nuclear tests), it improved the test-bed's handling qualities in several flight regimes. There is a reason the Tejas' test pilots call the aircraft to fly.

There are many other examples. The avionics. The mission computers. The navigation equipment, displays, and human-machine interface. The EW systems. This stuff isn't trivial by any yardstick.

Now coming to the foreign components aboard the aircraft. With the exception of the Americans, and to an extent the Russians, _every_ country has used foreign subsystems extensively in its aircraft designs. The [Gripen](http://www.airframer.com/aircraft_detail.html?model=JAS_39_Gripen) has an American engine, a British airframe design, Swiss carbon-fibre, an Italian radar, an American flight control system, a cockpit with critical components purchased from Britain, and so on. This in spite of the Swedes having an industrial base that is far more advanced than India's and extensive experience developing cold-war fighters such as the Draken and Gripen. The Rafale and Typhoon both use American ejection seats. Their flight control system uses actuators from Moog, an American company. The Russians were buying [Damocles pods](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/russian-fighters-to-use-thales-damocles-targeting-pods-220747/) for the Su-35s before the French stopped military exports after they invaded Crimea. Nearly every Chinese fighter in service today uses a Russian engine, a Russian ejection seat, and a slew of Russian weaponry. If these aircraft all qualify as ""indigenous"", then surely the Tejas does too?

The choice that Indian design agencies faced was quite stark: should they have tried to build every little component in-house, thus reinventing the wheel at every step? Or used technologies/sub-systems available easily in the market in the initial stages and then made an attempt to indigenise over the life-cycle of the product? It's obvious that the latter was the more sensible path to take.

In the final analysis, the Tejas is an aircraft that has been designed by Indians in India, and is tailored to Indian requirements. If that doesn't make it indigenous, I don't know what does.
	

**False Argument 4(b): Okay, I get that. But the aircraft's very heart, its engine, is fully imported! Surely it's an utter failure on that front?**

Yes and no. It has had a very protracted development cycle, and for good reason. A jet engine is arguably represents the pinnacle of modern technology, making it the most challenging system in the world to develop from scratch. It has to produce ungodly amounts of power for its size and operate at the very edge of what physics allows. The GE F404—which ended up replacing the Kaveri on the LCA—weighs just a shade over 1000 kg and develops close to 80 kN of wet thrust. Assuming that it propels the LCA to Mach 0.9 at sea level (1,100 km/h), it's developing about 24,400 kW or 32,700 hp. That's 32 hp per kg. In contrast, a Formula-1 car engine generates ""only"" 8 or 9 hp per kg, and it's about as far as one can get with piston engines.

What does it take to generate so much power? One needs critical components like turbine blade assemblies that see inlet temperatures of 1,400°C or so while being subject to extreme forces. A back-of-the envelope calculation using rectally extracted figures tells me that a single high pressure turbine blade weighing 50 gm, and rotating at 16,000 RPM at the end of a 500 mm diameter disk, will be subject to a centrifugal force of about 3,500 kgf. Imagine two Honda Civics hanging off a tiny blade that is about as large as two of your fingers held together. There is a transverse load component as well; the 80 kN of thrust is distributed over the turbine blades. 

In order to sustain such loads, exotic materials and precision manufacturing techniques are required. Steel melts at about 1400°C, and starts rapidly losing strength at less than 500°C, so it's obviously not an option. Modern engines instead use nickel-based superalloys. Moreover, the material can't simply be cast or forged or machined into shape. The blade has to be produced via directional solidification or grown out of a single crystal in what looks more like a lab than a production shop. The shape, too, is very intricate. There are internal channels that route cold air taken from the compressor to the surface of the blade to keep it cool.

The fan, compressor, combustor, gearbox assemblies, bearings ... they're just as complex. And they all have to be precision manufactured to ensure that microscopic imbalances don't end up leading to excessive vibrations that could end up destroying the engine and the aircraft while in flight. Then there are requirements like safety, fuel efficiency, minimum total technical life, and reliability that add multiple layers of complexity to the design.

Now imagine the magnitude of effort required to develop something like this, with practically zero infrastructure and very little in terms of  a pre-existing knowledge base. And with skinflint bureaucrats refusing to approve requests for funding, test equipment, or manufacturing tools without documentation being submitted in triplicate and subject to audit after audit.

Now let us talk costs. The GTRE spent [Rs. 2,000 crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rs-2101-crore-spent-on-development-of-indigenous-kaveri-engine-heres-why-theres-been-a-delay/articleshow/48282481.cms), or approximately $640 million in equivalent US dollars (with all the exchange rate and inflation variations that happened between 1989 and now taken into account), on developing the Kaveri. This seems like a lot, until you see that advanced nations spend billions on such programmes, and they almost never develop clean-sheet designs. They are always building on existing knowledge and existing designs. 

[Jeff Immelt, the CEO of GE says](http://www.businessinsider.com/interview-with-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-on-transforming-ge-2015-12), ""If you could make something with 60 people in a garage, GE shouldn't be doing it. But if you make a jet engine, there's only like one and a half people in the world that can make a jet engine. And we are really good at that. If you want to compete with that, you've got to put yourself on a wayback machine and go back 25 years and invest $1 billion here for 25 years and then _maybe, just maybe_ [emphasis mine], you're going to be able to compete with us.""

Think about that for a second. It requires 25 years. And a billion dollars. And then too, you're more likely to fail than succeed.

The Chinese have been pouring money and espionage resources into their jet engine development efforts (they have budgeted [300 billion yuan](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030)—about 45 billion in today's US dollars—over the next 20 years on engine programs alone), and are still facing [significant hurdles](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030). Why do people feel that India would get significant results by spending just a few thousand crores?

In any case, the Kaveri isn't a complete write off. A naval derivative, the [Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/built-for-air-force-kaveri-engine-chosen-by-navy-109090800089_1.html) may end up powering Indian Navy vessels. It is also under consideration to [power an Indian UAV](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/now-kaveri-engine-to-power-indigenous-uav-115073001650_1.html). 

There are civilian spin-offs too. For example, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) [now uses](http://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/English/DRDO_BROCHURE_2015.pdf) the investment casting technology developed by GTRE for manufacturing blades for gas turbines used in power generation.

**False Argument 5: In a globalised world, there is no point re-inventing the wheel. The IAF should simply dump it and buy the Gripen/F-16/MiG-35**

What is true for cell phones or cars isn’t true for military equipment. In the long run, in peace and in war, the IAF would be best served by fielding fighters designed and built in India. That's the only way it will equip itself with a large fleet on a (relatively) small budget. There are other advantages to developing the technology in-house: less dependence on foreign suppliers, leading to increased strategic independence. Creation of a stronger local economy and industrial ecosystem. The freedom to tinker with the design and optimise it to suit local requirements without running afoul of IP agreements with the OEM. Spin-offs in the civilian world. And so on and so forth. And if going indigenous is indeed the way forward, then the IAF will have to live with fielding under-performing/problematic designs at the beginning. It will have to make peace with the fact that aerospace R&D is a slow, painful process that is fraught with risk.

That's how practically everyone else did it. The Chinese did not seek out the latest and greatest toy because their initial designs (Q-5, JH-7, J-8, J-10) failed to match up to what the US, Japan, and India fielded. If the J-10B and J-20 are flying today, it is only because the PLAAF and PLAN flew inferior aircraft for decades while their industrial capabilities matured. As it is, the Tejas program's achievements have been quite impressive: the country has developed a fourth-generation fighter that is as good as the Gripen-C from scratch. It uses more home-grown technology than the Gripen does; including such critical subsystems like the digital FBW, the composite airframe, a large portion of the avionics, etc. Many of these have been applied to the IAF's legacy aircraft as upgrade packages. To throw it all away because of a handful of challenges here and there or because Lockheed or Boeing are offering to transfer their manufacturing lines to India would be incredibly, utterly stupid. If the Tejas is cancelled, we will have a repeat of the same thirty-year saga the next time India tries to build her own fighter.

[NP] Rant against GST!,27,6xsjmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6xsjmc/np_rant_against_gst/,21,1504465121.0,"Hello fellow randians! 

This might be a long rant but I think it might be affecting a lot of us here. Earlier, i.e. pre GST most restaurants and online food ordering places had their menus adjusted to whatever taxes they paid earlier and had figures like 199/299/500 etc. inclusive of all taxes. The breakup between the service and the tax used to be shown in the bill and didn't matter much as the bill was what I knew I was paying. 

Now in comes GST! The grand scheme supposed to propel the Indian economy to nobody knows what heights. :| 

Most restaurants and online places here in Bangalore just shamelessly add GST to the final bill and the justification is that it's mandatory. Now, I know it's mandatory for them, but what about the food prices? Practically none have adjusted their prices to take out the tax component that used to be added before. Case in point here is freshmenu. Great food, great service everything but then this. Had been noticing this since some time but just can't keep it in anymore.

Not just food, malls etc. now show the price without the GST so you're in for a rude shock when the cashier tells you the final amount. Didn't used to be the same amount earlier either but now it's way more than what you'd have thought.

I used to admire the current government a lot. Liked the statesman Modi used to appear. Still respect him for the foreign policy that seems to be going in the right direction. But at the end of the day/month I do have to take a look at my wallet. And frankly, I've been let down. Can't be too enthusiastic about a government that's continually taking steps to rip me of my money. I pay all my taxes regularly and do so happily, knowing that it'll be used for the nation, but to what extent do I keep paying up? 

The previous government used to be in news for various scams and the level of corruption used to be mind-boggling. But sorry to say, it never directly affected me or most of my acquaintances. I'm in no way justifying them, but at least they let the middle class grow independently. This government seems to be hell bent on killing it. And it's all done legally, so no one can really say anything. 

I'll go on a limb to say that the middle class consumption was driving the economic growth in this country since the last 15 years and with the measures that the govt is taking they're sure to kill it by making the middle class more conservative with their spending. And honestly, I'm actually wishing that it goes out next election. Well aware there's no other option we can actually vote for, but so so hoping that one comes up.

End of rant. Sorry. Bye! ",5
ACCOUNTABILITY: This is what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy and our Brown Lords.,85,69jpql,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/69jpql/accountability_this_is_what_is_wrong_with_indian/,29,1494078613.0,"If you are an Indian, it would be an astronomically impossible odd that you didn’t hear of how corrupt our bureaucracy is or how some **‘babu‘** or some **‘bade sahab‘** is corrupt and nothing more than a public disgrace. **That’s Indian bureaucracy for you.**

The real problem with bureaucrats is not just about caste and reservation. It is about accountability and responsibility. The pay structure of our Bureaucracy is such that officers get little salaries and large perks and amenities in form of bungalows and servants. In many cases, they occupy the same bungalows that the British left in 1947. And they do not do their job responsibly.

Fair disclosure that *I do understand and acknowledge the fact not all bureaucrats are corrupt. In fact, we have exemplary civil servants that have served as an inspiration to us all.* But this post is not about them, those honest civil servants. This is about what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy. The problem is not about the political issue or power struggles, but about an entire class of bureaucrats who are egoistic, arrogant, inhumane, corrupt and muddled with skulduggery.

**Bureaucrats, Bureaucracy, and Bureaucratic Measures** are now modern day derogatory overtones that express tyranny, arrogance and debilitation in our country’s governance. Bureaucrats are, in this day and age, perceived as those with massive egos and false nationalist zealotry. They are in essence a rule-bound bookkeepers who have ‘I’ mentality when it comes to interpreting rules. They play favorites, they are biased, they stay vague so that they are not held accountable, and they maintain chaos so that no one can see them cheat.

**From Outside: Looking In**

Don’t take my word for it. *I am just an ordinary Indian citizen exercising my freedom of speech.* Wouldn’t it help if you could see our Indian bureaucracy from an outside view? It is said that an unbiased opinion comes from the uninvolved. So let’s do that. Let’s see what others think of Indian bureaucracy.

In October 2010, just after the conclusion of Commonwealth Games in India, Eric Ellis wrote a post titled ‘A most uncivil service‘ on The Age where he talks about the Indian bureaucracy. Unfortunately, he has nothing good to say. He writes the following –

>""The Delhi games showed the world just what can be done when it's daunting civil service takes control – and the result wasn’t pretty. Corruption, waste, inefficiency, obfuscation and a cancerous lack of accountability in officialdom – and all of it on an Olympian scale.

>Delhi’s dramas may have been revealing for observers who briefly touch India but sadly these are the common issues daily confronting and long bedeviling a billion Indians and the foreign investors urged to invest their money in business there. Some economists have calculated that India’s bureaucratic inefficiency costs the country 1 to 2 points in annual growth.

>India’s daunting civil service is supposed to be the pride of the nation – just ask its privileged nabobs – but instead its malfunction and misgovernance hold India back. Enter any average government office in India and one is struck by the mountains of yellowing paperwork, years of filing and unfinished work ground down by the sheer scale of chaotic India’s myriad issues that overwhelm.""


Another account by Lant Pritchett of Harvard University sheds some brighter light on the Indian bureaucratic problem. In a paper, in 2009, titled “Is India a Failing State?“, he described Indian bureaucracy to be one of the most serious problems in the world today; up there with AIDS and climate change. He makes a point that foreign investments, and any welfare schemes in India for that matter, will never improve India’s economy as long as there is an inefficient Indian bureaucracy. These bureaucrats are like a tumorous growth that eat away any welfare funds like a parasite.

In his book “The Foundation Pillars for Change: Our Nation, Our Democracy & Our Future”, **Mr. V.K. Patel** writes that *most developmental spending fails to reach its intended recipients. It is either diverted or misused by a sizeable and a complacent bureaucracy.* I corroborate to Mr. Patel’s description of bureaucracy.

*We need to take away these IAS’s comfortable life devoid of any accountability for their country. Take away their big bungalows, their VIP status, their guards, their peons, their orderlies and hook them up to a system where they are rewarded for their good acts and punished for their bad deeds. Unless and until such an overhaul happens, India is not going to be a great country. No welfare policies will ever come to fruition. India cannot change without a change in our bureaucratic system. This is what is wrong with the Indian bureaucracy.*",5
The problems with India in 2018,4,7x9879,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7x9879/the_problems_with_india_in_2018/,6,1518555817.0,"There are many problems like

    Hypocrisy -

Indians from their birth till they die are taught and encouraged to be hypocrites !!! You can check in all aspects of life ! We are taught to be honest , gud etc but ordered , encouraged to be hypocrites so we can avoid discomfort in our lives !

    Education -

I hope we all know that the word “educate ‘in Greek indicates to bring out ones essence to total potential, but as you all know here in our country only information is feed and later that information is vomited in exams and we are awarded a degree !! Later we all are proclaimed as knowledgeable individuals !

So creative training is not given , practical emphasis and training is not taught in major engineering and science streams !

We are having most numbers of engineering graduate passing out every year in india !! But poor technical and practical knowledge of students is a drawback !!

    Blind beliefs and faiths -

With all due respect we were once upon a time very spirituality inclined nation around 2500 years ago , today most of indians are acting like sheep in lions skin !! We are so burdened by blind faith , belief , tradition etc that even if present generation is very rational and skeptical , our elders and tradition are complaining about generation gap , lack of tolerance , respect to them !!

Respect is given for ones higher qualities in various aspects but here in India it's by default a norm to respect elders , even if that individual is not worthy of respect !

I have been slapped and beaten on many occasions just because i questioned many times to my parents about respecting some old dodo , who was pain in ones a** for others !

Some much more to add on , but I feel if basics are changed , we would discuss about other social evils !

India has made a place for itself as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, yet it loses behind in a lot behind in the name of growth. As the rich are getting richer and the poor get poorer, the divide has been expanding more than before. What can after all be attributed to the various issues that pose a threat before every government that comes to power at the centre? From the increasing poverty, to the corruption at an all-time high, the increasing violence against women across the nation, the incidents of terrorism that rock some or the other city, and the rising prices of basic amenities, are some of the most scary facts of this fast-growing economy, India.

While these are not the only issues on the list, let’s go through some of the major social issues that mar the reputation of the country off and on:

    Poverty

Poverty is one of the biggest evils faced by India in the present scenario. With an increasing population of people in the Below the Poverty Line (BPL) across the nation, it seems like a never-ending issue. Rising inflation has added further to the existing problem. India has an unbelievable number of people suffering due to this evil. According to the Indian Planning Commission’s 2013 estimate, around 269 million people (approximately 22% of the total population) live under the poverty line. And, when we start looking around for what has actually been done about it, we wouldn’t really find much.

The government needs to take a strong action against the biggest social evil of all. Ministers need to work towards creating employment, and providing enough for the large population which does not even receive the basic amenities. New policies are the need of the hour, not only for employment creation but also to create a young educated population. Education must be promoted at all levels of the society to create awareness especially among the poor.

    Corruption

Corruption is ruining the spine of the nation, and has adversely affected the economy of India. India has been marred by a list of scams and scandals, which have crippled the nation from inside out. From the Coalgate scam, to the 2G scam, to the CWG scandal and the Bofors scam, all brought forward the weaknesses of a government and a nation as a whole. As the government at the centre changes every time, the blame game changes and political parties start blaming the other, but corruption is not really being fought at the ground level. From babus to ministers at the top, all have been found involved in some of the world’s biggest scandals.

What has created a hole in the pockets of the Indian economy, it has become essential for the government to tackle it at different levels. From strict rules at all levels of government undertakings, to an awareness among the people against the spread of corruption, needs to be maintained by the government. Anna Hazare’s fight againt corruption should actually be taken up by the leaders of the nation and must imply the Anti-Corruption bill in the government completely.

While pointing a finger on others is the easiest way out, people need to realise the need to get rid of the ‘under-the-table’ bribing habit and strengthen our system by neither giving bribe, nor taking bribe. The government needs to take strong action against a bribe-giver and a bribe-taker equally.

    Terrorism

Terrorism has affected India since the day India was partitioned. The dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan has been a long-standing unresolved issue. Using this, the neighbouring country has often used terror against India in the worst manners possible. Uncountable incidents of terror attacks in Kashmir, and its nearby regions such as Srinagar, along with the major cities of the country, have been a source of disturbance very often. One such incident which shook the nation was the 26X11 Mumbai terror attack, among the uncountable similar attacks. India has been disturbed by external terrorism as well as internal terrorism through Maoist attacks in the western parts of the country.

Terrorism mainly causes loss of lives, but also affects the country economically. Tourism in Jammu & Kashmir has suffered for years on end due to the threat to tourists due to sudden terror attacks. Alongside, the clean-up after every such attack involve long governmental processes. How is the government tackling the issue, only remains a question.

The government needs to take a strong stand against the neighbouring countries terror activities and needs to take action and not only hold peace talks. It’s the need of the hour that the citizens of the country are provided with security as well as an assurity of safety as well. A sensitive approach towards terrorists may be attempted to make them surrender.

    Communalism

Being a mix of differing cultures and religions, India has ever-since its formation suffered due to communal differences. Communal clashes have led to a lot of violence in various incidents across the country. The hindu-muslim clash during the partition of India, and the Operation Blue Star which led to the assassination of the then PM Indira Gandhi are the worst examples of communalism in India. Not to forget the bloodbath that took place during the Babri Masjid demolition case. India has been affected both economically and politically, after such incidents took place.

The government needs to handle such issues with extreme sensitivity, along with making sure that communalism is not used for political gains by its ministers. Besides political understanding, change needs to be brought from the grass roots level itself. The caste divide must be decreased by educating the younger generation and sensitizing them about such issues.

    Illiteracy

On one hand, India has a state like Kerala that boasts of 93.91% literacy in its state alone, while on the other hand there is a backward state like Bihar with 68.8% literacy rate. Education is not necessary for employment and learning, it is required to create a sensitive and growth-seeking younger generation. A youth needs to be empowered with education, to further know their rights as the citizens of the country. Illiteracy needs to be tackled as one of the biggest social evils of the nation, as this is the biggest reasons why the youth is misguided and involved in criminal as well as terror activities.

The government needs to enforce free education and strict rules to follow it in every family in India, poor or not poor. An educated population will eventually lead to the country having a stronger workforce as against the world. Education is sure to change the poverty and unemployment scenario in the country. At the core level, the people need to be made aware of the need of education to have enriched lives.

    Inflation

The past years have seen inflation as one of the major issues faced by the common man. The rising prices of basic amenities have created furore among the people. Rising rates of food items and fuel have affected the pockets of the middle class so much, bringing them out on the roads in protest. The government has not been able to fulfill any of the promises made before coming in power, which were all forgotten later, leaving the people to suffer the brunt of inflation.

There is an essential need to bring inflation under control, and bring basic amenities at affordable prices for all. When will this economic divide be erased, is a question no government has been able to answer as yet.

    Violence against Women

Women in India live under a constant fear all the time. A fear of going out alone, disturbs every female mind living in India. The rising cases of sexual abuse and rape across the country, have left a black mark on the reputation of India. Foreign tourists have been known to have been given special warnings while travelling to India, in fact some countries even labelled our nation as an unsafe country for women, after the deadly Delhi Rape case. Is this the reputation we wish to maintain across the world? Definitely not! But, what are we really doing about it. The recent rape cases in Badaun, UP moved the entire nation, though no concrete action was taken for a long time. Rapes continue to take place, and no action is taken against the culprits. In most cases, victims die, and if they survive they live a worse life than ever.

Before the government does anything about the security, the people themselves need to take a stand against crime against women. We as a society need to fight this social evil from within. The youth needs to be sensitized about the safety of women, and the respect to be given to women.

Strong police action needs to be taken against the culprits, and cases need to be handled with more sensitivity and through a quick process. We need to see justice happen, and now.

The country as a whole needs to be ready to tackle such social evils, along with the government. Democracy in india is a joke",5

Although the 2018 monsoon is expected to be average to above average in most of India, that is not the case in Punjab where rainfall is expected to be 30% below average. As I discussed in the previous podcast on Punjab, the region is dependent on an electricity and water intensive model of agricultural development focused on the production of rice paddy.

This podcast is a rerelease of the previous episode recorded on the economic history of Punjab focusing on how a colonial policy of recruiting Punjabis for the military, and concomitant need to keep the soldiers happy resulted in massive investments in agriculture. This policy continued through the post-independence period where the government of India subsidized electricity, access to water, fertilizer, and maintained high agricultural support prices to create a green revolution in the region. However, over the past 25 years, the state has been among the slowest growing in India as the state as the focus on agriculture has made it difficult to transition into an economy based on modern services and industry.

SaveTheInternet.in is live. Status Check on Net Neutrality consultations - June 2016,191,4n4o1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4n4o1d/savetheinternetin_is_live_status_check_on_net/,129,1465416257.0,"**tl;dr**

Preconsultation paper on NetNeutrality is just the first step of that process: consultations on throttling and VoIP will follow. Have to prevent fast lanes for the throttling paper. We're likely to lose the battle to prevent licensing of VoIP.

Free data paper is very tricky and we're now opposing databack models, after further examination (explained below). 

[SaveTheInternet.in](http://www.savetheinternet.in) is now live, in case you need help mailing the TRAI. We have only 8 days to go till the deadline. 

We'll publish our long submission tomorrow for public comments.

**Longer version**

So, we have two processes going on right now, and a third and fourth coming up soon. First the easy stuff:

**Preconsultation paper on Net Neutrality**: Includes all the issues remaining from the consultation last year in March, when all of us got involved for the first time. /u/shadowbannedguy1 has a submission he sent to this. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4lucjl/the_trai_has_a_new_consultation_paper_on_net/
Important to note that this isn't a consultation but a preconsultation paper. This means there's more to follow. O_O

**Consultation paper on Throttling:** will follow after the pre-consultation paper mentioned above. We have to be careful about telcos getting fast lanes for specialized services, and also them having the ability to charge netflix and youtube a congestion fee, because it takes away from the rest of access.

**Consultation paper on licensing of Internet Telephony**: will follow after the consultation paper mentioned above. It is likely that the two consultations will be separate because the TRAI can regulate throttling under QoS (Quality of Service), but it can only recommend licensing of Internet Telephony/VoIP. I remember hearing that the VoIP consultation will take place in July, but you never know. This will be a tough one to win (as in, no licensing) because the MHA wants it to snoop on your calls, and pretty much everyone in the government would want access to VoIP. Telcos are arguing regulatory arbitrage, and the DoT had recommended licensing. TRAI seems to be open to the idea of recommending this. To quote the TRAI Chairman: 
“An application is providing the same service that a telecom company is providing. TSP provides the service under a licence, communications-based OTT don't provide it under any licence. There is a regulatory imbalance.” [Source](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/52528968.cms)

**Now the clear and present danger**

**Consultation paper on Free Data**
TRAI has issued a consultation paper on free data, looking at models which allow giving free data to users. It says now that it is considering models which allow an independent platform (not a telco) to zero rate itself, or give free data for how much data was consumed. We hadn't focused on this extensively in the last consultation and we thought data back was kosher, but on further examination, we're don't think it is: We're opposing data back related to consumption of data because it has the same impact as zero rating of an individual site or a group of sites. The only difference between this model and airtel zero is that data consumed is being given back to a user after data usage, instead of during data usage. So, I use 11.3 mb of wynk, and the platform gives me 11.3 mb. It doesn't dictate that I use the 11.3 mb only for wynk, but it has effectively made my cost of using wynk zero. The TRAI chairman has also made some worrying statements:

“Free Basics had essentially tied up with Reliance Communications. So, if you went through the Reliance pipe, these sites were free. If you went through the Airtel or Vodafone pipes, these sites were not free. It's as though a shop in (Delhi's) Connaught Place is giving discounts but to only those who come in a bus provided by Mr X. If you don't come by that bus, no discount. That is not a good thing. If you give a secular discount, it is fine.” [Source](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/we-had-a-problem-with-free-basics-because-it-gave-free-data-only-to-those-who-went-through-rcom-pipe-ram-sevak-sharma-116053000014_1.html) 

[SaveTheInternet.in](http://www.savetheinternet.in) is now live. We have only 8 days to go till the deadline. 

P.s.: Apologies for the delay, but many of us had to go back to our actual jobs (and a couple of us had a pretty big mess to deal with because we were away from work for most of last year). So it's been tough getting ourselves going again, but a few of us have put in a lot of work over the past four days on this. This will be our 5th participation, after TRAI, DoT, Parliamentary Standing Committee and TRAI again, since March last year. 

You'll also notice that the submission is from the Internet Freedom Foundation. We have set up a non profit because we think we need to get more organized. More on IFF and its plans soon.

RBI report highlights reduced Rural earnings since Narendra Modi came to power [Policy],15,8ghi3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8ghi3n/rbi_report_highlights_reduced_rural_earnings/,1,1525297465.0,"**Article in Question:**

https://theprint.in/economy/indias-economy-will-work-when-its-women-do/54408/

**Text from the article:**

Rural India’s wages have taken a significant fall since 2014, when the Modi government assumed office, and agricultural workers have been hit particularly hard, according to an RBI analysis released Wednesday.

According to an RBI working paper titled ‘Rural Wage Dynamics in India: What Role Does Inflation Play?’ price rise took a heavy toll on the purchasing power of wages in India’s villages, throwing their growth into “negative territory” occasionally.

“This phase (post November 2014) is also characterised by low inflation occasionally surpassing growth in nominal rural wages, pushing real wage growth to the negative territory,” the report adds.

It points to the uptick in rural wages between 2007-08 and 2012-13, and notes that it occurred despite “elevated inflation”. Two factors are cited for this — implementation of the rural employment scheme MGNREGS and a healthy growth in the construction sector; factors that, the paper claims, have weakened in significance since.

Impact of MGNREGS
The report points out that though the phase after 2014 has been labelled a period of rural distress, the gap between average growth in rural wages and rural inflation is not so significant — while rural inflation was recorded at 4 per cent, the growth rates in nominal agricultural and non-agricultural wages averaged at 5.6 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively.

It says that since 2014, the relative underperformance of MGNREGS has been one of the main factors behind the slow growth in rural wages.

“MGNREGS, which was a driving factor (of growth in rural wages) during 2008-09 to 2011-12, seemed to have lost momentum in the recent years,” the paper said.

Under MGNREGS, the average number of employment days per household annually has generally been between 40 and 50, though the promise is for 100.

The average number of person-days for each household employed under MGNREGS fell during this period, as did the number of households getting 100 work days a year.

“MGNREGS wage growth also witnessed some moderation in the recent years, which could partly be due to indexation of wages to inflation and partly because of issues related to wage-fixation policies of the government,” the report added.

The other factors at play
According to the report, a host of other factors have been cited for the dampened growth of rural wages, “including the global slowdown in growth, collapse of international primary commodity prices and major contraction in food prices… most of which began around 2013-14”.

“Domestically, the economy suffered two consecutive droughts in 2014-15 and 2015-16. Growth in agricultural GDP slackened,” the RBI paper added.

Also, the construction sector, which boomed during 2000-2012 and was the major driver of rural non-farm employment, slowed significantly in the period concerned.

The report adds, “Also, 2014-15 and 2015-16 were subnormal monsoon years with weaker growth in agricultural GDP. The rural economy witnessed some revival in 2016-17 as monsoon turned normal…it did not provide a significant boost to the agricultural wages.”

Modi’s rural push found wanting?
The empowerment of rural India has been among the main promises of the Modi government, which has introduced several initiatives to this end, including Jan Dhan (to get every resident on the banking network), Ujjwala (to ensure an LPG connection for every household), the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (where every MP adopts a village for its development), and the PM Fasal Bima Yojana (for crop insurance).

There’s Swachh Bharat, with its push for the construction of toilets, and PM Awaas Yojana (Grameen), which has notched completion figures that are nearly twice its predecessor’s.

The crux of this push has been the belief that India’s development has to start from its villages.

However, a year before the 2019 general elections, there have been several reports of disenchantment with his government in the hinterland, with the opposition painting it as an administration that priorities business interests over farmers’.

Just recently, thousands of farmers marched to Mumbai seeking a loan waiver and the implementation of Swaminathan Commission recommendations, forcing the BJP-led Maharashtra government to give in.

In last year’s Gujarat’s polls, the BJP performed poorly in rural areas, pushing the party’s central government to renew its commitment to the rural economy.

Some examples where credit ratings agencies have been disproven and discredited time and time again,13,7dskdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7dskdq/some_examples_where_credit_ratings_agencies_have/,9,1511036085.0,"Should Indian government really be celebrating? Here are some examples to think not - 

1.""In November 1998, the day after the Japanese Government announced a large-scale fiscal stimulus to its ailing economy, Moody’s Investors Service began the first of a series of downgradings of the Japanese Government’s yen-denominated bonds, by taking the Aaa (triple A) rating away. The next major Moody’s downgrade occurred on September 8, 2000.

Then, in December 2001, Moody’s further downgraded the Japan Governments yen-denominated bond rating to Aa3 from Aa2. On May 31, 2002, Moody’s Investors Service cut Japan’s long-term credit rating by a further two grades to A2, or below that given to Botswana, Chile and Hungary.

In a statement at the time, Moody’s said that its decision “reflects the conclusion that the Japanese government’s current and anticipated economic policies will be insufficient to prevent continued deterioration in Japan’s domestic debt position … Japan’s general government indebtedness, however measured, will approach levels unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed world, and as such Japan will be entering ‘uncharted territory’.”

The then Japanese Finance Minister responded (with some foresight): “They’re doing it for business. Just because they do such things we won’t change our policies … The market doesn’t seem to be paying attention.” Indeed, the Government continued to have no problems finding buyers for their debt, which is all yen-denominated and sold mainly to domestic investors. 
How … could a country that receives foreign aid from Japan have a better rating than Japan itself? Japan, with an economy almost 1,000 times the size of Botswana’s, has the world’s largest foreign reserves, $446 billion; the world’s largest domestic savings, $11.4 trillion; and about $1 trillion in overseas investments. And 95 percent of the debt is held by Japanese people 

In the New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/business/international-business-japan-battles-bond-rating.html] the logic of the rating was questioned:

2. Comment by formers President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and former member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Bob McTeer who is described as having “free-market views” which “gave the Dallas Fed its reputation during his tenure as “The Free-Enterprise Fed”” (Source). McTeer says:

    It may just be me, but aren’t the credit rating agencies supposed to be rating credit?

    Yesterday, we saw a sharp market reaction when one of the rating agencies that gave AAA ratings to mortgage-backed securities larded with subprime loans called into question the credit worthiness of Britain. As is the case with the United States and the Federal Reserve, Britain and its Bank of England have the ability to create new money if necessary to pay off its debt at maturity. There is no sovereign credit risk. There is no need for credit rating agencies to opine on the credit worthiness of sovereign debt.

    Sovereign debt is subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates in general rise, outstanding bonds, sovereign and non-sovereign, will decline in price, the extent depending on how close they are to maturity.

    Sovereign debt is also subject to inflation risk. Holders of the debt are harmed if inflation outpaces their expectations when they purchased the debt.

    When Standard & Poor questions British bonds, they must be making a judgment about some risk other than credit risk. Given time, investors will learn to take such questions with a grain of salt and not overreact. Meanwhile, haven’t they done enough harm for this cycle?""

4.""Ratings agencies admit mistakes - Credit rating agencies have admitted errors were made when assessing some of the financial instruments that have been blamed for the credit crunch.

Representatives of the three main agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch, Moodys - were grilled by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

They said that their assessment of securities backed by sub-prime mortgages turned out to be incorrect.

But they said these instruments were not too complex to rate accurately.

""The assumption that we made about how these assets would perform in the future turned out to be incorrect,"" said Ian Bell, head of European structured finance at Standard & Poor's.

Iceland role

Credit agencies carry out work to determine the worthiness or otherwise of financial investments.

They have been accused of failing to spot the size and risk of the bad US housing debt that was resold around the world, causing multi-billion-pound losses.

It was the discovery of these losses that caused the global credit markets to freeze up, and ultimately led to governments around the world having to bail out their banking sectors.

The ratings agencies said that credit ratings were just one factor that investors should look at when making investment decisions, but admitted that less sophisticated investors may have been over-reliant on their assessments.

The committee also criticised the agencies for failing to warn their clients adequately of the problems faced by the Icelandic economy before its banks collapsed last year.

Some 116 local councils deposited more than £858m in the failed banks, because they offered a relatively high return with a high credit rating.""

5.""Who's to Blame for the Economy? Rating Agencies - A good measure of who is responsible for getting us into this mess is looking at who got rich off of it. Bond ratings agencies certainly got their share of the take.

Moody's Investors Service ( MCO) saw its profits quadruple between 2000 and 2007 and had a higher profit margin than any other company in the S&P 500 for five straight years, according to opening statements from Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations, in a congressional hearing on the ratings agencies he held in October.""

6. "" In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2010, the rating agencies came under criticism from investigators, economists, and journalists. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC)[39] set up by the US Congress and President to investigate the causes of the crisis, and publisher of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (FCIR), concluded that the ""failures"" of the Big Three rating agencies were ""essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction"" and ""key enablers of the financial meltdown"".[40] It went on to say

    The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies. Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms.""

8. Moody's And Japan - But think about the Moodys statement in relation to Japan. The logic (and that is being kind) goes like this:

             1. Economic growth is low in Japan and is pushing tax revenue down and welfare spending up – hence the budget deficit rises.

              2. Given the Japanese government doesn’t exercise its legal right to spend without issuing debt to match the spending, the rising budget deficit (as a result of the cyclical downturn) also means rising public debt.

             3. Moodys asserts (with no analytical or conceptual basis provided) that these rising deficits are in some way a problem per se (rather than being a reflection of the real problem – slow growth).

            4. So in their Pavlovian fashion, they downgrade the credit rating presumably suggesting the Japanese government is a credit risk without acknowledging the Japanese government can never be an credit risk unless there is a collective brain explosion and the Government legislates to renege on its financial obligations.

            5. They downgrade because the slow growth makes it more difficult to reduce the budget deficit without acknowledging that the budget deficit should increase to meet the challenge of slow growth.

           6. But then you are left to ask two questions. First, the Moodys logic would suggest they want to increase the borrowing costs of the Japanese government by reducing the demand for bonds (because the lower rating is meant to scare investors) which if you believed their type of reasoning would further negatively impact on economic growth. So what sort of logic is that? Moodys (if you had their model outlook) is saying the Japanese economy is damaged because of the recession but we are going to make it worse and therefore worsen the problem of credit risk.

           7. Second, of-course, neither their implicit notion that Japanese government debt carries a credit risk or that their ratings change anything anyway are valid. Note that a sign that government paper was not an attractive investment prospect might be rising yields as investors avoided demanding the paper. But Moodys acknowledges that there is an “undiminished home bias of Japanese investors and their preference for government bonds, which allows the government’s fiscal deficits to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally”.

So who would you bet on? A corrupt capitalist firm that has made some monumental mistakes in the past while handing out AAA ratings to firms who were paying them to rate their products or millions of investors who every day purchase Japanese government debt at stable and the lowest yields? The same investors who have been buying Japanese government debt while deficits have been rising and public debt ratios heading up beyond 200 per cent (compared to the ridiculous Reinhardt Rogoff default threshold of 80 per cent) for the last 20 years.""

8. ""What mindless rule is being applied here?

The whole thing is mindless. To repeat, the logic appears to be: Cut deficits to keep the Aaa rating – but that would undermine growth and push up the deficit and debt – which undermines the Aaa rating.

And the politicians and everyone else goes along with this nonsense. We really are not a very bright race of people.""

""A brilliant answer by Bala Senthil Kumar to the question below, as answered at popular Q&A site Quora.

 What is your view on the saying ""Congress has looted India for 70 years?""

It isn't the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

So, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!

So, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Then we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?

Only when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.

India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn't create the conditions for dignified development.

Incredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose's family's movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. 

The Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don't think so. That's how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.

It is the loot of India's pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.

If India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it's precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.

The economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.

Currently somewhere around 2-3% of Indians pay income taxes (correct me if I;m wrong). This is a horrible tax base, loss of so much potential tax money for the government. This means that govt employees (babus, netas, teachers, judges, diplomats) get payed a piss poor amount. Perfect incentive for corruption. Singapore pays their govt employees extremely well and have almost no corruption because there's no need to be corrupt (cause they are already rich). So thus it is crucial in the long run to increase our tax base and pay our public sector employees better. But that's easier said than done.

This section takes a look at the top security news around the world which impact most of us.

**[Bad month for Ethereum. Heists worth more than $50 mn in total](http://wccftech.com/hacker-love-ethereum-8-4-million/)**

Ethereum ecosystem is going through a rough patch. Ethereum is a blockchain based distributed computing platform and has a corresponding cryptocurrency called ""Ether"". Several hacks happened in this month totalling more than $50 mn. Apart from the bugs in the code leading to the hacks, another issue that came out to the front is hacking of the websites offering ICO (Initial Coin Offerings). At least one of these is also suspected to be an inside job/scam rather than being a hack. If you are thinking of investing in cryptocurrency, make sure to read up, A LOT, before investing and keep all your coins offline. I'd suggest to avoid ICOs in particular as can be seen in the above news and all over the bitcoin/other cryptocurrency forums and the news just keeps pouring in about malafide intentions behind most of them like this: https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/to-the-qrl-community-13c1e96e10c5

**[Update to iOS 10.3.3 now: Apple patches serious Wi-Fi exploit](http://www.macworld.com/article/3209658/security/serious-wi-fi-exploit-patched-by-apple-before-its-found-in-the-wild.html)**

Apple patched a bug recently, interestingly right before DEFCON 2017, that allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code on iOS devices over WiFi, without any interaction with the user. Make sure to update your devices asap. Most probably, you are not at DEFCON (if you are, you probably already know about this ;) ), but your friendly neighborhood teenage hacker may be out looking to get a guinea pig for his new attack :)

We know through stats that around 2050-60, the population the country will fall down, and with an estimated 2-digit trillion economy, we will see the rise of the GDP per capita.

This is all WITH the current TFR (It is at a replacement rate). Now we change some data shall we? The goverment decides that from tomorrow, would apply mandatory childless policies. It's illegal to procreate and people would need to adopt children if they want to be, you know, parents. Amazing! Orphans would get new homes and they are really happy (Let us assume, they law is perfectly enforced).

The TFR would fall down below the replacement rate, ensuring population WILL fall down. However, there's this problem: We have a lot old people, and the thing is *they can't work*. Especially a country like India, where there is huge population and on top of that: *a huge old population*. How are we going to give them pensions? Government would *spend* more than *gain* more? An old poor population isn't a very good incentive for FDI either. How are we going to tackle the massive grey population we have?

I have a passion for all things Technology including internet and technology policy, and firmly believe that technology can transform Indian Politics and Governance, our democracy and lives of all citizens.

I have worked as a Chip designer at Intel and worked on the 80486 and Pentium chips, Set up one of the first and largest Greenfield Indian cellular service BPL mobile, and then transitioned into being a technology entrepreneur. As an MP, I was also one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court PIL against the draconian Section 66A of the IT Act, which was struck down earlier this year.


I believe that the current debate on Net Neutrality is a result of the failure of our previous Governments r to initiate a robust multi-stakeholder discussion on Internet Governance  model based structure for Internet Governance. For over three years now, I have argued that we must strive to create a multi-stakeholder based model for Internet Governance,  which would have also resulted in a conclusion and debate of Net neutrality. 

I am doing this AMA to:
1.	Take a stab at addressing specific queries on the nuances of the Net Neutrality debate in India.
2.	Take any inputs from this chat back into Parliament and other interventions I shall be making with the Government on the issue, and
3.	Reinforce my commitment to the Net Neutrality fight and make my pro-neutrality position clear.

Over the past few years, I have become very jaded with computer science and engineering. Everytime I sit down to code for a job or assignment it feels like a meaningless task to me.  As a result, I find it tedious and I am not able to put in any effort that amounts to original work or learning. Computers have become boring to me! Moreover, I have developed cervical pain and think that I cant continue a career that requires me to sit in front of the computer all the time.

On the other hand, I have become more and more interested in the wider currents of the world covered in the social sciences like political economy or philosophy. Issues such as the impacts of technology, social organisation, policy,etc seem more important to me than the next great programming language or the iphone.

I am also interested in moving out of the country for reasons mentioned here - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/77z7a8/which_country_for_masters_and_further_job/

What next you ask?
Well, pretty easy to guess in next monetary policy review meeting u will get a massive rate cut to pump cheap money in order to boost manufacturing and consumption
well this might seems good in a very short run will have a really bad impact on our robust fundamentals built by rajan over the long period of time.
The same bad fundamentals which have resulted in a bad economy in many western countries and experiencing hard time passing over it.

**RBI Drops Rates Like They’re Hot**

After four interest rate decreases in the past one year, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates by 0.25% again to a more than [5-year](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-repo-rates-decision-idINKCN0X20C1) low of 6.5%. This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy.


**Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol**

Heartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever. The state has decided to go the route of Gujarat, Nagaland and Manipur to completely ban all sales of [alcohol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales) (you didn’t know it was banned in Nagaland and Manipur as well, did you?). The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company.

**One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure**

Indian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress? Only time will tell.

**Are Diamonds Forever?**

That’s the question the government is asking itself as it prepares to end its legal monopoly over diamond mining in India. After the first ever auction of a gold mine in February, which was won by Vedanta Ltd. ([VEDL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AVEDL&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), India is gearing up to do the same again and auction its first [ever](http://www.vccircle.com/news/infrastructure/2016/04/05/after-gold-india-set-its-first-diamond-mine-auction) diamond mine. The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.

**Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers**

In Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well. For Amitabh Bachchan though, this just negates all the good PR that the *do boond zindagi ke* polio campaign brought him. As for you, see if you can even point to where Panama is on a globe.

"GST: Small exporters exempt from furnishing bank guarantee - who are small exporters, any threshold income for export of services (s/w freelancing)?",17,73qvjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/73qvjz/gst_small_exporters_exempt_from_furnishing_bank/,5,1506949969.0,"As a welcome move and relief, small exporters are now exempt from furnishing bank guarantee. They may still need to provide LUT/ bond as it requires a legislative change and needs more time: 

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/small-exporters-exempted-from-furnishing-bank-guarantee/articleshow/60886311.cms

I am a software professional working as an independent contractor for an overseas client. Last year 44ADA was introduced for professionals with income <50L. They need not even maintain records if they're paying tax on at least 50% of their total income and need not have any dependency on CAs. 

With GST, as per some CAs, to avail zero percent tax exemption for export of service we need to provide a bond with bank guarantee and file monthly GST returns. Most of us feel the need to hire a CA with an increased compliance and monthly fees burden.

I hope, in the time to come
1. minimum threshold for small export of services is kept at not less than 50L
2. if we still need to provide a bond there should be an option to generate and submit it online, so as to eliminate any physical interaction with the tax authorities
3. requirement of the bond, monthly GST return filing can also be eliminated for export of services (earnings at least below 50L), its affecting several s/w freelancers.

From short term perspective, does anyone know who are small exporters? At least I might not need a bank guarantee for now. I may still need to file monthly GST returns.  ",5

I will add more. 

Some users pointed that there is no good journalism. But that's not right. There is a good journalism but we have to find it. I am creating these lists to help ourselves. As a conscious and educated citizens we have to be careful as much as we can. Sometime you can find a good article in the bad list and a poor article in the good list. Above lists are not strictly implying but providing a general idea for us to be careful.

"Now that Raghuram Rajan is leaving, let's talk about his replacement: The Monetary Policy Committee",151,4osapv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4osapv/now_that_raghuram_rajan_is_leaving_lets_talk/,40,1466347710.0,"#Exit Raghuram Rajan, Enter Monetary Policy Committee

Now that Raghuram Rajan has resigned, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) of his own free will of course ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), it’s time to talk about his successor: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). You heard that right, a whole committee is set to replace him soon enough.

The media, at the moment, is filled with people sitting in two camps. One is mourning the loss of a great visionary central banker who was putting the ‘[sex back in the sensex](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-09-13/news/42041678_1_raghuram-rajan-rbi-guv-duvvuri-subbarao)’, while the other is excitedly discussing who is going to replace Rajan. 

> “Is it going to be Subramanian Swamy? That wily little fox has been planning it all along!”

> “Is it going to be Pahlaj Nihlani? He makes so many interesting cuts, probably he’ll be good at cutting interests too!”

> “Is it going to be Arundhati Bhattacharya? The first *woman* RBI chairman! That would sell, boyz, that would sell well indeed!”

> “Is it going to be Tanmay Bhat? He can then announce interest rate cuts over Snapchat. He’ll snap the economy in the Bhat and bring it back to shape!”

But what our dear media and ‘experts’ don’t seem to be talking about is the real replacement, the change of epic proportions that is going to happen to our central bank. So I present to you, the **Monetary Policy Committee**.

Don’t take *my* word for how important this is. RR makes a sly mention to this & the NPA problem in his [farewell letter](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=37259) too. All in one breath, squeezed between cryptic messages of being ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) forced to resign ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) as Governor of RBI.

> Inflation is in the target zone, **but the monetary policy committee that will set policy has yet to be formed**. Moreover, the bank clean up initiated under **the Asset Quality Review**, having already brought more credibility to bank balance sheets, **is still ongoing**. International developments also pose some risks in the short term.

___
#OK. RR is sexy and all. But n00b question: *What* does an RBI Governor do exactly?
___

Before we start talking about the big change, we should talk a little about what the job of the Reserve Bank of India Governor is. It would make it easier to explain the transition from Governor to MPC.

*(Check out /u/ribiy's comment: https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4osapv/now_that_raghuram_rajan_is_leaving_lets_talk/d4f7ll5. He explains this part more lucidly.)*

Think of the RBI as a big bank that lends to other smaller banks, those banks in turn lend to you. Commercial Banks *also* get their own money (through deposits) etc and then lend it to people (Thank you /u/MyselfWalrus). The Governor takes a call on what interest rate the RBI will charge to the banks they are lending to. In turn, those banks would add a tiny percentage of their own to that interest and give loans to people like you & me. The difference of interest rates between deposits & lending is where the banks make the profits, the central bank keeps control over how cheap or expensive loans in the market will be. The governor also sets the *Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)* for banks. That’s basically the amount of securities (Gold, bonds, assets) banks need to have to disburse loans of a proportional amount.

Apart from setting interest rates, he also is a sort of a Bank Manager. He keeps the machine running smoothly, so to speak. He also decides how much money is to be printed in what denominations. The Governor also gets to put his supercool signature on currency notes. He makes sure the cheques get cleared, fair exchange of funds happens between banks and basically keeps a watch on the banking sector through regular audits. 

The Governor is incharge of maintaining order in the foreign exchange market and making sure the country is working towards the goals set by the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). He also has the power to issue directions to banks, the recent one where he ordered a cleanup of balance sheets and declare Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). This is the **Asset Quality Review** that he mentioned in his farethewell letter as well. (Details about the NPA problem can be [read here](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/we-need-to-talk-about-our-banks))

Basically, the RBI governor gets to control how much money is floating around in the market. By increasing/decreasing interest rates, he can control spending within the market and feel like a finance god. The one single job of the RBI Governor over the past few years is to resist the pressure of successive governments & reduce interest rates too much. 

Or, at least, that is the part of his job that gets him in the news.

___
#OK. So the RBI Governor is an epic Finance God that gets to screw the government over, right? RIGHT?
___
Hey now! That’s harsh!

The Governor actually has a job of ensuring economic stability. He/she (‘she’ because now that’s possible!) is supposed to think long-term, ensure that the citizens don’t go on an insane spending spree and create artificial financial bubbles that will burst later and bite ‘em in the a. (Eg: The 2008 Housing Mortgage crisis in the US)

The Government, on the other hand, is a creature with a life of 5 years. In those five years, they are desperately trying to woo the voters and get them to vote for the same political party in the next election. What would make people happier than having more money to spend, ergo cheaper and more accessible loans! 

The government of the day will keep asking the RBI Governor to lower interest rates so that there is more money flooded in the market (""Bubbles? What bubbles? We'll deal with them *if* they burst""). The RBI Governor refuses most of the time because propping up an economy on the shoulders of a creature called ‘debt’ is… well… a TERRIBLE idea.

*Well, whatdoyaknow, that’s all about to change!*

___
#Alrighty then! Tell me about the big ‘change’.
___
[The Finance Bill, 2016](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2016-17/fb/bill.pdf), which was passed in the last budget session of Parliament, had a [controversial amendment to the FCRA act \(Clause 233\)](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/last-week-in-parliament) that allowed foreign funding to political parties. But but but, it had another amendment to the Reserve Bank of India Act (Clauses 216 to 220), which created this entity called the “Monetary Policy Committee”.

Earlier, the Governor was the whole & sole authority to decide interest rates. He could veto anything that he thought doesn’t benefit the Indian economy. It was a dictatorship and there was no way around it. Now, the MPC will be the one setting rates and making fiscal policies for the country.

The MPC will have six members, three from the RBI and three ‘eminent personalities’ appointed by the central government. The RBI peeps will consist of the Governor (Chairman), Deputy Governor & one officer nominated by the RBI central board. The 3 ‘personalities’ will be selected for a period of four years by [the following people](http://imgur.com/2ZTbQRm). 

Each member gets one vote. If there is a tie, [the RBI Governor gets the casting vote](http://imgur.com/xJT8Hi8).

Every member has to give a written statement explaining why they voted in favour/against a resolution. However, all proceedings of the Monetary Policy Committee [shall remain confidential](http://imgur.com/NtBtUkW).

These are the *bare bone facts* that I have presented to you. You can interpret it in whatever way you want. I am going to go ahead and give my take on it.

____
#Democratic way of functioning
___

Most global banks have this process of having a committee to decide rate and monetary policies. In the US, the Federal Open Market Committee has seven board members, all of whom are appointed by the President for a period of 14 years. In England, the MPC has nine members (5 from the Bank of England and 4 appointed by the Minister of Finance).

In India, the debate for forming an MPC began in February 2014. The RBI, back then, recommended that this committee should have Five members (Three from RBI and Two Government appointed). In 2015, the Government recommended that the committee should have Seven members (Four Govt. appointed and Three from the RBI). After much haggling and powerplay, they seem to have reached a compromise with equal number of members from both sides. 

Jaitley mentioned in the Lok Sabha during the Finance Bill 2016 debate that this MPC was formed in consultation with the RBI, so itsallgood. 

**Or is it?**

Earlier the Governor was incharge of making the right call. He was solely responsible for any bad decisions that he takes and the economy suffers as a result. So it also meant that the Governor was that much careful before lowering interest rates or taking any major steps. Now, there’s a committee in place, the responsibility of the decisions taken would be *diluted* between six people. ([Shared Responsibility](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-responsibility/))

Let’s assume a scenario where there is a resolution in place to lower the interest rate. Three people (government appointees) vote in favour and the other three (RBI appointees including the Governor) vote against. It's a tie. Now the governor gets a casting vote. Logically, the governor would vote against, keeping in line with his first vote.

But what if he/she decides to vote in favour? What would that exactly mean, in terms of attributing responsibility for making bad decisions? There is always the factor that the new governor would be someone who totally favors the Government and takes decisions based on only their recommendations. 

Or worse, takes decisions to *be in the favour* of the Government.

- RR was in favour of the MPC model. What he wasn't in favour was the composition of the committee. (/u/DARKKKKIS [gave a link](http://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-very-happy-with-composition-of-monetary-policy-committee/articleshow/51372691.cms) for the same)

- The composition has since been changed to the present version.

- You can't have a Nihlani or Sharma as the govt nominees because the Committee also mentions the selection process for these people. It will be done by an external panel which includes the RBI Governor.",5

Small scale semicon fabs plus note to entrepreneurs [POLICY],33,68jwe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/68jwe2/small_scale_semicon_fabs_plus_note_to/,11,1493639990.0,"So, Government policy to build semiconductor fabs in India has failed. India has also failed to attract investments in electronics assembly except related to mobile phones and to lesser extent STBs.

If India needs to truly become an IT power then semiconductor fabs are must have.

As government may decide to transition towards electric vehicles, thus our oil imports will fall, but semiconductor imports will rise.

I will not reveal here, but small scale semiconductor manufacturing models can be innovated.

There are some groups in India innovating for RISC-V.

Semiconductors will be increasingly needed everywhere, from solar plants, solar pumps, cars to energy efficient lights.

Yet, India is forced to import semiconductors and precision engineered products like high end molds, tooling, bearings and so on.

Still, most entrepreneurs are focusing on web stack based apps, me-too ecomm, elearn, transactions, travel, accommodation etc. Or J2EE customization (sap, Oracle,jboss) or freelancing​/consulting.

Nothing groundbreaking. India will never produce any Google or Facebook and also never produce any Tesla, SK Hynix, SolarCity etc.

India gets new, groundbreaking products only when PSU units licence produces it for B2b or when a private lala big business house licenses something from abroad.

So called wannable startups and entrepreneurs not relevant to produce anything for real economy.",5
"[AskIndia] Is India on its way to becoming a Fascist nation, or is it already one?",25,5ectir,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ectir/askindia_is_india_on_its_way_to_becoming_a/,43,1479873616.0,"Umberto Eco, a famous author who lived under the fascist regimes of World War 2 Italy, once listed 14 features of Fascism. Reading [that list on open culture](http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html) got me thinking about how a lot of people throw around the F-word when referring to modern India, and I figured that r/india would have answers for this.

Two caveats. One, I'm as biased as you are regarding where and how I get my news, so maybe I've been hearing Fascist, while you're hearing Reformist. Two, I don't actually have any proof that says that this list is definitive proof of fascism. It's Umberto Eco's opinion, and if you take issue with it, feel free to go spit on his grave.

Here's the list:

> 1. The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”

> 2. The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”

> 3. The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”

> 4. Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”

> 5. Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”

> 6. Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”

> 7. The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”

> 8. The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”

> 9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”

> 10. Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”

> 11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.""

> 12. Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”

> 13. Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”

> 14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”


What I'm taking away from this mostly pointless exercse, is that Indian society is quite susceptible to Umberto Eco's model of Fascism, largely due to its deference to tradition, a lack of cultural identity and a burgeoning middle class.

EDIT: Since a lot of people seem to be confused about this. Wikipasta for Fascist beliefs below.

> Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete, and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. Such a state is led by a strong leader—such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party—to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature, and views political violence, war, and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies.",5
"Why Rao is considered so Chankyan, a brief into into the 91 reforms",125,3lnf6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3lnf6a/why_rao_is_considered_so_chankyan_a_brief_into/,109,1442758815.0,"The narrative about our BOP crisis today largely seems to be, India was almost bankrupt (true), IMF handed MMS (and Rao) a list of reforms, reforms passed, huzzzah!

The reality is very very different from this narrative. In reality, PVN had these massive issues to overcome,

* A minority govt
* A very partisan opposition (even more so than today). Atleast today the plank is supposedly 'development', back then it was all about ""garibi hatao"", ""support our PSU's to the death"". 
* Look at the seat strength the opposition had - JD+CPI held 102 seats, the BJP 120. These two combined alone could defeat any motion.

If you think the UPA had it tough, and the NDA has it tough today...think again. PVn had a minority govt, had to hardsell 'reforms' which were a very very dirty word back then, had to fight deeply vested interests. If we are a crony capitalist state today, in 1990, it was pretty much open house. Rules and policies were made by the Dhirubhai's.

How did he do all this? Read on,

To be fair to Rao, he was not a great economist, heck he was barely an economist, but he played the political game very well. He for instance put forth the idea of liberalising a very vocal sector (say mines), and then promptly backtrack (As though he was surrendering) and putting in its place a more...milder reform.

Look at how...spectacularly he played the New Industrial Policy of 91. It was a breathtaking move (for India) in that it virtually did away with Nehruvian era relics of licensing and control for industries. It could have boomeranged on him, so what does the sly fox do? Announce it the exact same day (At around 4 PM, to ensure it made the next days print news) of the budget for 91.

What did it look like? Mr MMS passed this reform. If it did boomerang? Who could be sacrificed? FUCK! I mean, you look at all this and you have to admire the sheer political statecraft of this wily old fox.

Look at broadly how well he handled this whole reform process? He first announced a broad slew of measures (to shut the IMF up), and then promptly delayed the introduction of bills or overall went very slow in actually bringing these into action. And then the rolling thunder movement, hit one broad policy front with mild reforms. Wait for fall out, quell it (with outright bribery if needed) and introduce a marginally more...powerful reform. On and on it went.

One thing he never did was pick a battle he knew he would lose. So he never went after the big PSU's, never the big vested interests, never the farm or social welfare schemes. He brilliantly picked the battles he knew he would win. He admired Willy Brandt and modelled himself on this other wily old fox.

The final piece of the puzzle! Despite being a politician, he never openly spoke about the reforms nor his overall aims. This kept everybody guessing and confused and he basically was free to do as he wished.  I think his brilliance can be explained simply by saying something he used to say often ""delaying or not taking a decision in itself was a decision"". This is most evident in the way he handled (again, quite spectacularly) the Fertilizer crisis. He had to reduce the fertilizer subsidies, but it was (and still is) a political hot potato. So what does the fox do? Again, push it via MMS, and when the shit storm hit, MMS ""offered his resignation"" which the fox graciously refused, AND then he sets up a committe, which mollifies the protestors, and then he passes the reforms with a 10% cut from the original increase.

I mean, this level of political guile and statecraft is just astonishing.

It is a fucking pity he didn't have a govt with absolute majority in the LS or that he didn't get a second term (sadly he was a Gandhi loyalist to a fault). If he had...

Not even touching the deft political moves, I mean this guy played all spectrums like it was a violin. Left? Check (V P Singh's faves, Montek Singh & Rakesh Mohan were his key advisors). BJP? Check. There is always this dark speculation though that he allowed Babri Masjid to be taken down, with the trade off that the BJP support his reforms, but this is and will remain unfounded speculation. He really was a supreme political master, and without him, not a single reform would have been passed.

I must point out, was he some sort of angel or something? No. He maybe was personally corrupt (we don't know), he associated with, nay was intimately associated with a deep rat bastard like Chandraswami. PVN had his flaws, but that shouldn't take away from his monumental achievements.

Why was the 91 budget so...landmark? Here are some top reasons why,

* Rupee was devalued, and devalued again.
* New trade policy favouring exporters (a bad word in the maai-baap socialistic model of Indira and Rajiv...not Nehru)
* Dismantled the license raj
* Put forth an austerity budget (before it was cool) and aimed straight away to cut deficit by 3-4% points.
* He near abolished export subsidies

Wired story on 'How Trump Conquered Facebook - Without Russian Ads' | What it means in diverse Indian society,7,81cer1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/81cer1/wired_story_on_how_trump_conquered_facebook/,1,1520002008.0,"Here's a thought-provoking article in Wired, titled [How Trump Conquered Facebook—Without Russian Ads](https://www.wired.com/story/how-trump-conquered-facebookwithout-russian-ads/), on how Facebook's **auction system optimized for content engagement which heavily favored troll-y, outrageous, clickbait-y ads**. 

Think about what it does for politics, in diverse Indian context, when algorithm doesn't care about civic engagement as much as it care about its expected-profits.

Some Excerpts:
> Last Friday, Rob Goldman, a vice president inside Facebook’s Ads team, rather ill-advisedly published a series of tweets... the tweets said that the **online advertising campaign led by the shadowy Internet Research Agency was meant to divide the American people**, not influence the 2016 election.

> You’re probably skeptical of Rob’s claim, and I don’t blame you. The world looks very different to people outside the belly of Facebook’s monetization beast. But when you’re on the inside, like Rob is and like I was, and you have access to the revenue dashboards detailing every ring of the cash register, your worldview tends to follow what advertising data can and cannot tell you.

> ... Russia’s Facebook ads were almost certainly less consequential than the Trump campaign’s mastery of **two critical parts of the Facebook advertising infrastructure: The ads auction, and a benign-sounding but actually Orwellian product called Custom Audiences (and its diabolical little brother, Lookalike Audiences). Both of which sound incredibly dull, until you realize that the fate of our 242-year-old experiment in democracy once depended on them, and surely will again**.

> ... During the run-up to the election, the Trump and Clinton campaigns bid ruthlessly for the same online real estate in front of the same swing-state voters. **But because Trump used provocative content to stoke social media buzz, and he was better able to drive likes, comments, and shares than Clinton, his bids received a boost from Facebook’s click model**, effectively winning him more media for less money.

> ... The above auction analysis is even more true for News Feed, which is only based on engagement, with every user mired in a self-reinforcing loop of engagement, followed by optimized content, followed by more revealing engagement, then more content, ad infinitum. **The candidate who can trigger that feedback loop ultimately wins. The Like button is our new ballot box, and democracy has been transformed into an algorithmic popularity contest**.

> **But how to trigger the loop? For that, we need the machinery of targeting... Despite folklore about “selling your data,” most Facebook advertisers couldn’t care less about your Likes, your drunk college photos, or your gossipy chats with a boyfriend**... Custom Audiences lets them do that. It’s the tunnel beneath the data wall that allows the outside world into Facebook’s well-protected garden, and it’s like that by design.

> ... **Facebook can also populate an audience by reading a user’s cookies—those digital fragments gathered through a user’s wanderings around the web. Half the bizarre conspiracy theories around Facebook targeting boil down to you leaving a data trail somewhere inside our consumer economy** that was then uploaded via Custom Audiences. In the language of database people, there’s now a “join” between the Facebook user ID (that’s you) and this outside third-party who knows what you bought, browsed, or who you voted for (probably). That join is permanent, irrevocable, and will follow you to every screen where you’ve used Facebook.

> ... **With a mere mouse click from our hypothetical campaign manager, Facebook now searches the friends of everyone in the Custom Audience, trying to find everyone who (wait for it) “looks like” you**. Using a witches’ brew of mutual engagement—probably including some mix of shared page Likes, interacting with similar News Feed or Ads content, a score used to measure your social proximity to friends—the Custom Audience is expanded to a bigger set of like-minded people. Lookalikes.

> ... **We’ve all contributed to this political balkanization by self-sorting (or being sorted by Facebook) into online tribes that get morphed into filter bubbles, which are then studiously colonized by commercial memes planted and spread there by a combination of Custom and Lookalike Audiences**.

> ... None of this is even novel: **It’s merely best practice for any smart Facebook advertiser. Custom Audiences was launched almost six (!) years ago, marketed publicly at the time, and only now is becoming a mainstream talking point**. The ads auction has been studied by marketers and academics for even longer. The only surprise is how surprising it can still seem to many.

> If we’re going to reorient our society around Internet echo chambers, with Facebook and Twitter serving as our new Athenian agora, then we as citizens should understand how that forum gets paid for. Rarely will the owners of that now-privatized space deign to explain how they’re keeping the lights on. 

Now, back to India, the **most diverse democracy** in the world:

How do you think this will play out in Indian context, where populace are even more susceptible to hate-stories and fake-news meant to trigger religious/caste polarization; which often results in **people engaging far less on policy issues like health-care, education, job opportunities, agriculture, inequality** etc.

And believe me, without a passport or a visa, that was not easy. Almost got me killed, phew. But I managed to catch a Pidgey during the whole thing, so that’s good.*

*“The tax department has to start trusting the assessee and the taxpayer.”* - Finance Minister Arun Jaitley [making](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/tax-dept-must-trust-assessees-jaitley/article8804085.ece) a case for increasing the taxpayer base. With the Panama Papers and the Swiss Leaks and Messi getting convicted for tax fraud, somehow the words trust and tax department just don’t sit comfortably within one sentence.

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

Mallya, however, insists that he did no such thing.

**Apple’s New China Is India**

When Steve Jobs, ex-hippie and the founder of Apple, visited India in the 1970s, he wore a lungi and [roamed](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/what-steve-jobs-did-in-india-35-years-ago-225246) barefoot. Until, of course, the Indian national disease of diarrhea cut his trip short and sent him back to the US. Fortunately for all of us, when Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple, visited India last week his attire did not include a lungi and he probably drank bottled water, as is tradition for all foreign tourists in India. In between wild Bollywood parties at SRK’s house and IPL matches in Kanpur, Tim [announced](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-tim-cook-samples-bollywood-cricket-in-bid-to-woo-india-1463822223) a startup accelerator in Bengaluru and the opening of two new offices including one in Hyderabad. It wasn’t all play and no work - Tim met with businessmen like the CEOs of ICICI Bank, Vodafone India, TCS and heads of state like Prime Minister Modi, the Telangana CM and many more. But why India and why now? After reporting the first quarterly decline in sales that was largely caused due to slowing growth in China, Apple is now searching for something other than China to fuel growth for the coming decade. And Apple’s next China might just be India. Tim termed his visit to India as ‘fantastic’ but then again, he also ran into Alia Bhatt. So it’s entirely possible that his statements were laced with sarcasm.  

**The One With Trump, Brexit and India**

Britain, the former colonial master of India and more countries than you can even name, is going through an independence movement of its own. Currently, the country is a part of the European Union, a political and economic union of 28 countries in Europe. In a public vote to be held on June 23rd, Britishers will decide if the nation will stay in the European Union or get out of the European Union. All of that may be Britain’s headache but a new report out of SBI [suggests](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-brexit-can-open-up-opportunities-for-india-sbi-research-report-2212552) that even though a Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) could be terrible for Europe, it could turn out to be hugely beneficial for India since Indian companies will no longer need to follow complex trade agreements while dealing with Britain. Likewise, a former US Diplomat says a Trump presidency in the US, while [terrible](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/if-donald-trump-becomes-us-president-india-may-gain-at-chinas-expense-heres-why/articleshow/52380459.cms) for China and Pakistan (...not to mention Mexico) might actually turn out to be great for India as ~~Donald Trump~~ Dear Leader’s foreign policies are likely to shift the balance of power in Asia in favour of India. The word to describe what you’re feeling right now is schadenfreude - taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Trust me, *I know words. I have the best [words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T-Eo0j092Q)*

**The Banking Bloodbath**

With the whole bad loans crisis being shoved in everyone’s faces, it’s no surprise that banks are feeling the heat. Saddled with a ton of losses caused by increasing net non-performing assets (the fancy term for bad loans), conditions are becoming dire. A host of smaller banks reported earnings last week and it’s not good. If you have a phobia of falling bank profits, turn away now and seek professional help because it’s about to get gruesome. Alright, [here](http://www.livemint.com/Money/1MpJ5uNbQXhacOWKTo3PWJ/PSU-banks-shares-fall-after-weak-earnings.html) we go: Dena Bank reported a loss of ₹326 crore, Allahabad Bank reported a loss of ₹581 crore, Central Bank of India reported a loss of ₹898 crore, UCO Bank reported a loss of ₹1,715 crore and Syndicate Bank [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/syndicate-bank-q4-loss-at-rs-2158cr-provisions-jump-3-fold_6677621.html) a loss of ₹2,158 crore. Going for the silver medal is Bank of Baroda with a loss of ₹3,230 crore, the second highest loss in the history of Indian banking. And now, for the gold medal, the worst loss in the history of Indian banking ever was reported at a record-breaking ₹5,367 crore by *drumroll* Punjab National Bank. It feels good to have found the rock-bottom at last. At least now, there is nowhere to go but up. That’s what investors in bank stocks are saying to themselves so they can sleep well at night. Let’s hope for their sake that we don’t find a new bottom in the next quarter.

**|| || || > | | | | | |**

So you might’ve heard: The banking industry is in a bit of a tight spot. There haven’t been any bankruptcies (phew) yet. But there’s blood on the streets. And the only way to patch the wound is to stick together in times of trouble. State Bank of India, one of the largest banks in India, [proposed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-bank-of-india-says-no-talks-on-merging-with-any-other-lenders-1408323) a plan to stick together and merge with its 5 associate banks: State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore plus the newly created Bharatiya Mahila Bank. If merged, the combined bank will become a banking behemoth with 50 crore customers. And behemoths don’t bleed easy. Taking cue, the government is also urging UCO Bank, Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank (all of whom have reported losses) to find themselves a relatively well off bank and merge their losses away. Playing the merger game is tricky business. You don’t want your merger to be like Romeo and Juliet. Sure, they made history but they both died in the end. You want your merger to be like Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. One that can live happily ever after.

They say there’s no use digging up old corpses. And declassifying old government records can sometimes certainly feel like digging up old corpses. Well, this time the government might have found a zombie. After releasing old records relating to the Azad Hind Bank, founded by Subhash Chandra Bose, many borrowers have [approached](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-16/news/73126343_1_currency-notes-bank-notes-legal-tender) the finance ministry asking the government to recognize the currency issued by the Azad Hind Bank in 1944 as legal tender, so they can use it to repay existing loans. In a country of more than a billion people, there’s potential for more than a billion bizarre stories. And this is just one. 

$1 billion is the number of the week for Apple. $1 billion is the amount that Warren Buffett, the billionaire that has traditionally and even proudly shunned technology, has [invested](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21699139-meaning-two-odd-and-connected-investments-1-billion-stakes-menu) in Apple shares over the last quarter. $1 billion is also the amount that Apple invested in Didi, not the Bengali politician, but Uber’s competitor in China. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s girlfriend, reportedly owns shares of Apple, which makes her an investor in Didi. That’s got to make for some very awkward pillow talk.

Rajan didn’t step down. He was pushed out in one of the most unfortunate decisions of the Modi administration. There are a lot of similarities with how Abdul Kalam was denied a second term as the President by Sonia Gandhi. In both cases, you had an amazing individual who had the energy, reputation and the will to stand up to the government. The political heads hate such a challenge.

Unlike the past RBI governors who were given 5 year terms, Rajan was only given a 3 year term by the previous government and the present government used that chance to deny him a second term [for the same reason that the previous government gave him such a short term]. I will give you some background.

There were sparks publicly flying between RBI and the government for a while and this end result was probably not a total surprise. RBI and the government are two opposite forces [sort of like developers and testers in a software team] who work to build the economy.

The government has the control of the “fiscal policy” - dealing with matters like spending and taxing. The reserve bank has the control of the “monetary policy” - dealing with matters like interest rates and bank loans. Governments would typically love to spend/invest a lot to grow the economy, while the RBI would love to have the government spend less & maintain a low inflation [more government spending equals more inflation].

In short, the government is the accelerator and the Reserve Bank is the brake.

If you don’t press the accelerator, you won’t get anywhere. If you don’t press the brake, you will get somewhere [not necessarily alive]. There is a healthy conflict between the two.

While there were tensions even in the past, they were quite less. The RBI governors are usually mellowed men [in a land of many women bankers, they never get picked to head the RBI] who are honest and smart, but will quickly back down from a conflict. They are typically old too - sort of like the Presidents - chosen carefully to not have too much energy.

Rajan is among the youngest RBI governors and is a live wire. He has an international reputation no other RBI governor ever had. Within his 40s, he has seen some of the world’s best economics related posts - including being the youngest Chief Economist of the IMF (International Monetary Fund) . He doesn’t require a job. India required him.

Rajan was an energetic drill sergeant who makes you sweat and no body likes to sweat. He was brought in as a desperate move in the last days of the Manmohan Singh government which lost all its credibility and needed something to restore India’s credibility in the financial markets.

As India’s economic prospects improved with Modi’s arrival [and with a healthy dose of Rajan’s policies] the desperation of politicians went away. The tough medicine started to taste bitter as the emergency passed. They believe Rajan is applying the brakes even after the calamity has passed and you have a free road ahead of you. Rajan believes that he needs to keep off the sugar so that the government can snack on a healthy diet.

Unlike the previous RBI governors, Rajan also made a few political statements that unlike how the media reported, were not that controversial. However, like the President, the RBI governor is expected to stay away from politics and not make any statements unrelated to their job.

These two things cost his job. a) He was an inflation hawk whom the government and business community accuse as pressing the brakes too much. b) He had too much energy and independent thinking.

The question is not just one of Rajan or inflation or interest rates. It is about a system where the heads of key institutions are not expected to stay independent. This political meddling has been there since the start [from the times of Nehru]. We always elect old, unambitious, insipid, uncontroversial leaders for our top posts because the top politicians are scared of ambition, energy and independence. In the rare times these get selected, the politicians push them out sooner or later.

Even if the government doesn’t like their ideas or policies, it has to work with them - because our system is only as strong as its institutions. The government has to change its mind and bring back Rajan.",5
Indian support of Israel,22,4js6uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4js6uc/indian_support_of_israel/,68,1463536368.0,"Let's have a dispassionate discussion of Indian relations with the middle east.

I am wholeheartedly in support of increasing ties to Israel, even going as far as signing defense treaties with them to secure their independence(Aerial, Naval and spec ops assets only), maybe not now but a decade later latest by 2030.

From my perspective taking into account the backstabbing done by Arab states during the '71 war is something to be remembered. Why support the Palestinian state when they the entire Arab world except the Saddam Hussein regime backed Pakistani claim on Kashmir and sent military aid during the war.

Gone are the days when we supported the Arabs either out of fear for our Muslim population's vote or Nehru's idealism. Israel has helped us quite a lot.

Let's see the sole protector of Israeli state right now is United States, any attempt to run over Israel during the cold war with Soviet arms by the Arabs would have ( and did in fact during the yom kippur war) invited Americans to bolster Israel even more so the Soviets stayed clear of too much trouble.

By 2048 the United States will be neck to neck with India economically and China would have surged far ahead of us. As such I don't see United states continuing their aid to Israel, whereas we would be in such a growth position to spend a few billions on helping Israelis, the question is should we put the building blocks in place now?


**EDIT** I suppose most of the fucktards calling me names about our economy, I say check IMF and World Bank reports. Just because you have a hatred for the current government or were not good enough to have a nice career does not mean our economy is bad. 
I have seen my mother's salary increase from her starting of 26k in 1991(inflation adjusted) to about 4,00,000 today.  I asked for a dispassionate discussion but what I am for the most part getting is shits. Fuck off if you have nothing to contribute to this policy discussion.

I read through the entire speech and would like to go through it point by point

>Today we see that even when the issue of ecology is being discussed in details for past many decades, **yet we find that with each passing day the ecological destruction is approaching much faster and closer to us.** Because of this environmental destruction, the world is facing newer and deadlier natural calamities consistently. But except for some changes in their vocabulary or some half hearted attempts at symptomatic treatment, no meaningful change is visible in the policies of nations and large multinational companies.

Good, raises the issue of environmental conversation. As we have seen in Uttarakhand, Pune Landslide and several other natural calamities, damaging the environment can be catastrophic. Hopefully, the government is listening. I am worried because it doesn't seem to be listening. Context: http://qz.com/255772/the-11-environmental-disasters-narendra-modi-blessed-in-his-first-100-days/

>In the history of past one thousand years, Bharat has been the only example which has made genuine efforts in this direction through the path of truth and non-violence. ... Neither any questions are raised against one’s faith being different, **nor campaigns are run to destroy other idols of worship**, **nor there is a tradition of raising disputes over the validity or respectability of other’s faith on the basis of systems restricted by the dictates of a book.**

Really? Babri, Kandhamahal happened in Pakistan? Furthermore, his arguments are directed towards Abrahamic religions since they follow a central book. However, the Dharmic religions in India are not immune from religious dogmatism.

>With similar expectations in mind, few months ago, the people of Bharat brought about a drastic change in the government. **This change of government is not even six months old. But positive signs are emanating from time to time** which give hope about emergence of Bharat on the international horizon and it appears that the people’s desire of a life, secure and progressing in all its aspects, will soon start reflecting in the governance. In a very short period, some policy initiatives taken by the central government in national interest on the fronts of economy, national security, international relations and many other areas have raised good hopes.

I was told that this was a non-political event. Why he is praising the BJP government here? 

>The new policy makers should also take best advantage of the vision and experience of **great Bharatiya leaders** right from the tradition of Swamy Vivekananda, Yogi Arvind, Swamy Ramtirth, Gurudev Ravindra Nath Thakur and Lokmanya Tilak to Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Swatantrya Veer Savarkar, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Acharya Vinoba Bhave, Second Sarsanghachalak of RSS Shri ‘Guruji’ aka Madhav Sadashiv Golvalkar,  Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, Jayprakash Narayan and Pt. Deendayal Upadhyay. 

Notice how not even a single Muslim is named. How about people like Abdul Kalam Azad? Again ties in with their ideology. 

>There is a serious **upsurge in the jehadi activities in the southern parts of Bharat**, especially in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. No effective policy imperatives, efforts are visible in curbing such activities. ... Near surrender before these fanatic elements and appeasement policy adopted by the ruling parties in these states, **have put the life of local Hindu communities, the law and order situation as well as the national security under serious threat in the region**. 

Really, the Hindus and their way of life is under threat in Tamil Nadu and Kerala? Or does the RSS chief subtly want to hint at the rising Muslim population in these states and and wants to tie that to rising terrorism in the state. 

>Though an alert, transparent, sensitive and a rule abiding administration is necessary for ending exploitation and ensuring development, equally important is the role of society in eradicating exploitation of the poor through active cooperation, striving in a democratic way to end their exploitation and by running various types of help and support activities in order to take these fruits of development to the deprived people. **We feel it necessary to put a ban on meat exports, beef in particular and cow smuggling in immediate future.**

I was completely with him till the last sentence. How is a ban on meat exports, **beef in particular**, going to help the poor in India? Will it not just eradicate one source of income? 

>Each one of us must test each of our act, whether big or small, on the simple ground that each member of **my great Hindu society**, and each son/daughter of Mother Bharat, is my own brother and sister. We must ensure that **each of our Hindu temple, cremation ground and community water source must remain open to all Hindus**. We should ensure that all Hindus should participate in all functions, celebrations as well as festivals of great heroes and personalities.

So much for the RSS being a national entity, or are non-Hindus anti-national?

>Since its inception, Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh has been engaged in the great mission of building a work force of such swayamsewaks, who are energized with the **pride of their national Hindu identity**; are empowered by inculcating great qualities in their personality; and are prepared to sacrifice everything even their life for the great goal as a constituent of dedicated and disciplined organisation.

Just a little more Hindutva.

The entire speech is very political in nature, it has nothing to do with Vijay Dashami. He is pushing for an India that reflects the RSS' vision, and I find that deeply disturbing.

TRAI Issues a Consultation Paper on Cloud Computing: More serious issue than NN? What do you think?,67,4nkpo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4nkpo0/trai_issues_a_consultation_paper_on_cloud/,33,1465663974.0,"So, the consultation paper is [here.](http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReadData/WhatsNew/Documents/Cloud_Computing_Consultation_paper_10_june_2016.pdf) | **Issued 10 June 2016**

Comments have been solicited till upto July 8, 2016.

I won't discuss the technicalities of what it seeks to achieve and how. *The Hindu Business Line*, rightly or wrongly, has a scare-mongering headline for its piece this morning:

[Govt wants to legally snoop into your emails](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/govt-wants-to-legally-snoop-into-your-emails/article8714983.ece)

Since, we do know that the previous dispensation sought to gain control over how Indian users access and use the internet and it is common knowledge that it is very much in the present government's interests to continue to do so (under the garb of 'Lawful Access', of course) by generating a seeming 'consensus' on the subject through 'open' consultations, I figured I could highlight some of the problematic ways in which this issue has been framed.

Before i do that, these are the questions that the paper requests responses to:

* **Question 1**. What are the paradigms of cost benefit analysis especially in terms of:
* a. accelerating the design and roll out of services
* b. Promotion of social networking, participative governance and e-commerce.
* c. Expansion of new services.
* d. Any other items or technologies. Please support your views with relevant data.
* **Question 2**. Please indicate with details how the economies of scale in the cloud will help cost reduction in the IT budget of an organisation?
* **Question 3**. What parameters do the business enterprises focus on while selecting type of cloud service deployment model? How does a decision on such parameters differ for large business setups and SMEs?
* **Question 4**. How can a secure migration path may be prescribed so that migration and deployment from one cloud to another is facilitated without any glitches?
* **Question 5**. What regulatory provisions may be mandated so that a customer is able to have control over his data while moving it in and out of the cloud?
* **Question 6**. What regulatory framework and standards should be put in place for ensuring interoperability of cloud services at various levels of implementation viz. abstraction, programming and orchestration layer?
* **Question 7**. What shall be the QoS parameters based on which the performance of different cloud service providers could be measured for different service models? The parameters essential and desirable and their respective benchmarks may be suggested.
* **Question 8**. What provisions are required in order to facilitate billing and metering re-verification by the client of Cloud services? In case of any dispute, how is it proposed to be addressed/ resolved?
* **Question 9**. What mechanism should be in place for handling customer complaints and grievances in Cloud services? Please comment with justification.
* **Question 10**. Enumerate in detail with justification, the provisions that need to be put in place to ensure that the cloud services being offered are secure.
* **Question 11**. What are the termination or exit provisions that need to be defined for ensuring security of data or information over cloud?
* **Question 12**. What security provisions are needed for live migration to cloud and for migration from one cloud service provider to another?
* **Question 13**. What should be the roles and responsibilities in terms of security of (a) Cloud Service Provider(CSP); and (b) End users?
* **Question 14**. The law of the user’s country may restrict cross-border transfer/disclosure of certain information. How can the client be protected in case the Cloud service provider moves data from one jurisdiction to another and a violation takes place? What disclosure guidelines need to be prescribed to avoid such incidents?
* **Question 15**. What polices, systems and processes are required to be defined for information governance framework in Cloud, from lawful interception point of view and particularly if it is hosted in a different country?
* **Question 16**. What shall be the scope of cloud computing services in law? What is your view on providing license or registration to Cloud service providers so as to subject them to the obligations thereunder? Please comment with justification.
* **Question 17**. What should be the protocol for cloud service providers to submit to the territorial jurisdiction of India for the purpose of lawful access of information? What should be the effective guidelines for and actions against those CSPs that are identified to be in possession of information related to the commission of a breach of National security of India?
* **Question 18**. What are the steps that can be taken by the government for:
* (a) promoting cloud computing in e-governance projects.
* (b) promoting establishment of data centres in India.
* (c) encouraging business and private organizations utilize cloud
services
* (d) to boost Digital India and Smart Cities incentive using cloud.
* **Question 19**. Should there be a dedicated cloud for government applications? To what extent should it support a multi-tenant environment and what should be the rules regulating such an environment?
* **Question 20**. What infrastructure challenges does India face towards development and deployment of state data centres in India? What should be the protocol for information sharing between states and between state and central?
* **Question 21**. What tax subsidies should be proposed to incentivise the promotion of Cloud Services in India? Give your comments with justification. What are the other incentives that can be given to private sector for the creation of data centres and cloud services platforms in India?

While I feel that issues of interoperability and quality of service as well as standards are red herrings of a sort (there isn't much of data to support the contention that these *are* or *will become* serious issues impeding cloud adoption in India), the following sections appear to indicate areas of concern (if not outright conflict):

>*The Government of India proposes to bring out legislation namely* ***“The Right to Privacy Bill”*** *which aims to provide for the ‘right to privacy’ to the citizens of India. It is said that intellectual property issues in the cloud continue to be one of the ""cloudiest"" legal areas for customers and suppliers alike because IPR and data protection laws vary from country to country. This makes the application of laws difficult since the question of jurisdiction creates confusion in the cloud computing environment since there are plenty of different ways in which copyright-infringing content can be uploaded onto the cloud, given the vast number of services, which are provided, in the cloud. To deal with this problem, it needs to be ensured that every party involved is well aware of the regulations and the rights of the country in which the data/work is so stored and how potential infringements can be efficiently avoided.*

>*Lawful Interception: This is an extremely important aspect of any communication or information transfer as* ***Lawful Interception by a Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) is an established and transparent method*** *for letting Governments protects their boundaries, integrity and sovereignty in addition to national security. The Government will have to ensure a strict and vigilant interception system in cloud computing environment so as to meet the above requirements. With more and more happenings in the cloud – the previous methods of Lawful intercept are no longer valid and as such need new thinking as:*

>* *Machines and data are no longer physically in one place or national boundary*
>* *Encryption and security of data are far stronger and of industrial grade*

Personal and sensitive data has to be maintained with utmost confidentiality; and the trust of the information provider must be safeguarded.

Citing the need to monitor domestic Internet traffic for national security reasons, concerns over foreign surveillance, and a desire to ensure that data is subject to local laws, the Indian government has for years supported the idea of foreign firms storing data within the country. One clear example of the push for data localization is found in the Department of Telecommunications’ “National Telecom M2M Roadmap” (referring to machine-to-machine data transmission of the sort expected to increase substantially as Internet connected devices become more common), in January 2015. T**he guidelines call for “all M2M gateways and application servers” used in providing services to individuals in India to be physically located within the country, based on national security concerns**. *Although cloud vendors would not be the explicit focus of this provision, its inclusion points to the acceptance of data localization policies among some in the Indian government*.",5

**Killing Tax Havens - One Treaty At A Time**

Question - What country ranks second in the share of foreign portfolio investments made in the Indian stock market? Answer - First of all, that is a very specific question to ask. And second of all, if you [answered](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-12/news/73039798_1_tax-treaty-capital-gains-tax-mauritius) Mauritius, give yourself a pat on the back. It’s not that ~~Martian~~ Mauritian citizens are crazy about Indian stocks, Mauritius is just an island that is even smaller than Mumbai and Delhi put together. It’s that investments made through Mauritius were exempt from Indian capital gains taxes - which essentially transformed Mauritius into a tax haven. It was all legal under a 30-year old treaty between the two countries that was signed in 1983. Ahh, the 1980s - when the Panama Papers wasn’t a thing, the accountants didn’t have to worry about ethics, and writing physical letters was actually cool and not just hipster cool. But all that and more is changing. Under an amendment to the treaty that was [agreed](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/u4AzTTKA5vCRJBWhANkuZN/Some-FAQs-on-the-Mauritius-tax-treaty.html) upon last week, India will begin imposing a capital gains tax on all future investments made through the country. This gives existing investors some wiggle room, and doesn’t trigger a crash in case existing investors decide to pull out.


**Raghu’s Second Term**

Time flies when you’re having fun, and it’s already time for another governor at the RBI. Current governor Raghuram Rajan’s term is about to end in September and there’s some awkward tension in the air about his reappointment since Rajan’s crusade against bad loans is expected to be done by March 2017, a full 6 months after his term expires. Chosen under former PM Manmohan Singh’s administration, Rajan [says](http://www.businessinsider.in/RBIs-Raghuram-Rajan-keeps-mum-about-second-term-but-reveals-his-backup-plan/articleshow/52185985.cms) he hasn’t been asked if he wants to continue as governor and intends to go back to teaching when he’s done. He can act as coy as he wants, but everyone knows that he wants to continue as governor. Who wouldn’t? It’s like asking an olympic gold winner if he’d like to continue winning the gold. However, the newest member of the Rajya Sabha, Subramanian Swamy, has [stated](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/send-raghuram-rajan-back-to-chicago-subramanian-swamys-new-attack-1405498) that Rajan is unsuitable to run the RBI and shouldn’t be reappointed. Swamy says that Rajan should instead pack up his bags and go to the US, where he is a professor at the University of Chicago. ‘Go back to (insert country here)’ seems to be a recurring theme lately.

**EPF Changes: Strike Three?**

At first they tried to tax your EPF withdrawals. But that didn’t work out. Then, they tried to restrict EPF withdrawals until you’re 58. But that didn’t work out either. Now, they are back. And this time, they want to help you buy a house. A new scheme currently under discussion would [allow](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/epfo-members-to-benefit-as-govt-plans-low-cost-housing-scheme-for-over-5-cr-subscribers/251510/) you to pledge future EPF contributions as installments towards buying a house. Here’s how it would work: You go out and try to find your ultimate dream house. You give up and settle on one that your wife likes, because you just want to get this over with. Then you find a bank that doesn’t think you’re Mallya 2.0 and gives you a home loan. And now, your future EPF contributions can count as installments on the home loan. But you also have to be a low-income first-time home buyer to qualify. The last two times any modifications to the EPF system have been proposed, they have backfired. If this were baseball, the batter is already two strikes down and might end up with a strikeout, if this backfires as well.

**Numbers You Don’t Want To Hear**

The kryptonite of any agrarian economy is a prolonged drought. Like the one we’ve been having in over 10 states for the past two years now. A recent study [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/rs-650000-crore-thats-the-impact-the-drought-will-have-on-the-indian-economy-says-assocham/) the total impact of that drought on the national economy at ₹6,50,000 crore. That number is so huge, your brain is incapable of processing it. That’s because a loss of ₹100 is a tragedy, a loss of ₹100 crore is a statistic. Moving on to some much lighter news - the Indian banking [system](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/its-that-bad-if-you-pay-rs-150-for-a-bank-stock-rs-50-is-going-as-bad-loan/articleshow/52291846.cms) is on fire. If you spend ₹150 on buying stock in the average Indian bank right now - you’d be spending ₹50 just to purchase the bad loans that come with the bank. The skeletons could’ve stopped tumbling out at any point - but what’s the fun in that? New estimates show that the amount of bad loans in the Indian banking system might be greater than the entire economy of New Zealand. Little reminder - In statistics, you can either pick the data and write the story it supports, or you can pick the story and write the data that supports it.

Here is the government, pushing hard for change. To aspire to move from 140 to 50th rank in the Ease of Doing Business rankings is a huge huge step. To this aid, the govt has,

> The department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) has circulated 98 action points to state governments on ""creating an enabling framework for simulating investments 

The thrust is now on states to implement these and also lower ranked states to start performing better. This is a very objective way of ranking everything from the labour climate to corruption and time taken to implement projects and transparency of govt approval systems.

This as the govt is implementing, has the potential to be a game changer, and yet it gets scarce attention - be it on MSM or social media.

DAE Le Acche Din won't happen by magic, it is going to be hard slogging and it is policy decisions and plans like this that will help us get there.

Edit - Some more info,

>Does anyone know the parameters on which the states will be judged? I think thats an important thing to know, when talking about this.

I don't think the DIPP guidelines are available yet, but the metrics used in this ranking can be seen [here](http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/india)

There are broadly 10 main parameters, each of these 10 parameters have between 15 to 30 sub parameters, so we are looking at around 200 odd indicators.

**WANTED: RBI Governor**

Alright, you knew this was coming. You don’t live under a rock. You’ve heard about this. We have had wall to wall coverage of this story since it broke. And as the most important economic story of the week, it has to be talked about here. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan does not [want](http://in.reuters.com/article/rbi-chief-rajan-quit-idINKCN0Z50N2) a second term. In a message to the RBI staff that was released on the central bank’s website, Rajan has stated his desire to not continue as the governor. Instead, he’s going back to his old teaching job in the US. Apparently, the governor was very much interested in serving a second term. But getting reappointed would mean that he would have to maneuver the delicate political minefield. And Rajan was unwilling to get down and dirty in the intricate interlockings of Indian politics, which has now become more complex than the plot of Game of Thrones. And so, the House of Rajan will now be leaving the show in September. This decision to not continue marks a political victory for the campaign against his reappointment, which was led by Subramanium from the House of Swamy. 


**Flying Higher**

Rule 4/20 is the rule that states you must smoke a little something when the clock strikes 4:20. Rule 5/20 is not as exciting or fun, and only applies to the Indian aviation industry. The 5/20 rule states that any Indian airliner must have 5 years of experience flying domestic routes and must own 20 aircrafts before it can operate any international routes. It might sound like redundant regulation to you, but that’s not how the folks at Jet Airways and SpiceJet see this. To incumbent airliners who already satisfy the rule, this is hugely beneficial since it removes competition on international routes. But to newer airliners like Air Asia who don’t satisfy the rule, this is a lost business opportunity. But a new civil aviation policy approved last week [removed](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-airlines-rules-idINKCN0Z110J) the 5-year experience requirement, however the 20 aircraft rule still stands, making it the 0/20 rule. A big round of FDI reforms has also eased rules for FDI in the aviation industry.

**EU & Britain - The Big Divorce**

Britain, the real reason why Indians love tea and cricket, is going through a messy divorce. In a nation-wide referendum, Britishers will soon vote if they want the country to leave the European Union or stay in the European Union. A popular argument for staying in the EU cites the disastrous effects that the British economy is expected to experience if it leaves. The UK Treasury [says](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/macro-view/talking-point-brexit-and-indian-markets/article8748796.ece) that if Britain leaves, inflation will spike, unemployment will rise, and GDP growth might be 6% lower. But let’s be honest, most of you can’t be bothered to keep up with even the Indian economy. The news is boring, uninteresting, mundane and all the other synonyms of boring. And here is a story asking you to care about the British economy. So before you tune out, know that you should care about this because the global economy is a series of dominos, and one of them might fall next week. Most of the world is urging Britain to stay in the EU. But really, the only evidence that anyone needs to take into consideration is - Donald Trump supports Britain leaving the EU. And that right there, should be enough information for the British people to know which way to vote.

**STILL WANTED: RBI Governor**

You know what? We haven’t talked about this enough. This story deserves another look. The big news of Rajan’s departure was dropped in an open letter that Rajan wrote to the RBI staff. And it caught everyone off-guard, including the government. While Rajan gets ready for his exit interview, the government is busy looking at résumés of candidates to fill his position. The news of his departure isn’t even a week old, but the race to replace him is already starting to heat up. The shortlist has as many as [seven](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/seven-names-on-long-list-to-replace-rbis-rajan-official-1420762) people, but the frontrunner right now is Arundhati Bhattacharya, a high-profile banker who has been at the helm of India's largest lender - State Bank of India. If you think you can make the shortlist, send your CV to: Sansad Marg, Janpath, New Delhi, Delhi 110001. Either way, get ready to bid farewell to Rajan. It sure was good while it lasted, wasn’t it? But like all good things in life, it had to come to an end. Rajan, we had a lot of fun together, didn’t we? Remember when you cut consumer inflation from a high of 11.16% to a low of 3.69%? Yeah.. Good times. And remember when you increased the foreign exchange reserves from $275 billion to $363 billion? Yeah... Those were the days. I’m sorry, I think I need some time alone.

* To stop cheap imports of foreign wheat from messing with the domestic wheat market which employs a lot of farmers, the government levies a duty of 25% on all wheat imports.

E-commerce is when you sell inventory directly to the buyer. Current regulations don’t allow FDI in e-commerce, which means foreign companies like Amazon can’t enter the e-commerce industry. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently met PM Modi and lobbied him to allow FDI in e-commerce.

Qatar’s economy is largely based on oil and prices are not exactly ideal right now. So if you’re wondering how they are even paying for the stadium, wonder no more - The Gulf country has cut planned spending on building hospitals by about two-thirds in 2016 following the drop in oil prices to keep expenditure on its World Cup-related projects unchanged. Those are some solid priorities right there.

Consumer inflation, which halved during Rajan’s tenure, came in at a 21-month high of 5.76% for the month of May. Food prices for the month went up by 7.55%, also a 21-month high. Wholesale inflation, which was negative until two months ago, came in at a 19-month high of 0.76%. RAJAN. THERE IS STILL TIME. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME.

The TRAI has a new consultation paper on net neutrality--its fourth one so far. Here's my response.

It is available [here](http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReaddata/ConsultationPaper/Document/Net_Neutality_Preconsultation_30_may_2016.pdf) (PDF!).

The following are the questions it asks, along with my responses.

Advisor (QoS)  
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India   
Mahanagar Door Sanchar Bhawan  
JL Nehru Marg, New Delhi—11002  
India  

Sir,

I thank you for the opportunity to respond to this pre-consultation paper on net neutrality. At the outset, I request that my email ID not be disclosed on the TRAI website.

Please find below my response to the questions posed in the paper.

**Q1. What should be regarded as the core principles of net neutrality in the Indian context? What are the key issues that are required to be considered so that the principles of net neutrality are ensured?**

The ideal core principles are as follow:

a)	Complete non-discrimination on TSP’s part with regard to pricing, speed, or appearance^1 of web pages and services.  
b)	Complete non-discrimination with regard to platform and application. This is already covered in the TRAI’s Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services, 2016.  
c)	Complete non-discrimination with regard to **protocol**. This was not included in the Prohibition passed earlier this year. It leaves open for TSPs the ability to throttle or block VoIP, P2P, or other protocols that are detrimental to their business or contribute to network congestion.  
d)	No compromise in the above principles in response to business interest of TSPs. The onus should be on the TSP to provide services that compete with those available on the internet.  
e)	“Dumb pipes” are a must, i.e., the TSP must not shape traffic based on internet consumption patterns to the detriment of any service or website (traditional traffic management, which only wants equal QoS across websites/services should be allowed). Legal requirements of logging unencrypted data may be explored under existing laws.  

The only acceptable exceptions to the above principles must be i) access exclusively to a billing website and payment gateway when the user has run out of their data plan, or when their internet connection’s billing cycle ends, and ii) for enterprise connections built for a specific purpose using CECN. The latter is already covered by the Prohibition mentioned earlier.

The key issue that must be considered is the **lack of comprehensive regulatory precedent for robust net neutrality**. Examples of this are mentioned below.

•	In the US, although there are some net neutrality regulations, the American TSP T-Mobile maintains a scheme named “Binge-On”, where subscribers can access services like Netflix, YouTube, and HBO in 480p video quality for free, whereas other internet traffic is metred regularly. The US lacks the regulatory instruments to stop this discriminatory practice.

•	In Japan, the Guideline for Packet Shaping gives ISPs the power to penalize or discriminate users who use a lot of data. This is a dangerous power to give ISPs. In India, the issue of network congestion by a minority of broadband users has been resolved with data caps, which won’t be needed, hopefully, in the future as network infrastructure expands to accommodate all levels of usage.

•	In Brazil, traffic shaping is allowed under “extreme circumstances” of technical requirement, which TSPs may themselves determine. This potentially allows ISPs to throttle websites, services, or protocols (specifically P2P).

•	The European Union’s regulations allow member states to permit zero-rating.

Therefore, India has the opportunity to be a **regulatory pioneer** by adopting comprehensive net neutrality laws that are forward-looking and fair.

**Q2. What are the reasonable traffic management practices that may need to be followed by TSPs while providing Internet access services and in what manner could these be misused? Are there any other current or potential practices in India that may give rise to concerns about net neutrality?**

Traditional traffic management practices that ensure equal quality of service for all websites, services, applications, platforms, and protocols must be the only type that is allowed. Any practice that artificially modifies the performance, speed, or appearance of the mentioned factors must not be allowed.

Around the world, large internet companies that account for a significant percentage of internet traffic are often burdened to work with ISPs to ensure fair quality of service for consumers. Google, for example, has Google Edge^2, a peering network that ISPs can use to connect directly with Google’s data centres. Netflix^3, the world’s largest internet TV network, also maintains an Open Connect program  in which they give out free copies of their entire video catalogue to ISPs, so that the latter don’t have to bear the cost of downloading video streams from Netflix’s servers.

As video consumption grows in India, as mentioned in the consultation paper, it must be emphasized that internet providers, not internet companies, must bear the brunt of maintaining equal quality of service. Otherwise, it may become standard for large internet companies to resort to partnerships with ISPs to ensure adequate quality of service.

A current (undeclared) practice of violating net neutrality is practiced by Airtel. After a data plan runs out on a prepaid mobile connection, WhatsApp continues to work, even as the rest of the internet redirects to Airtel’s billing page. This must be stopped.

**Q3. What should be India’s policy and/or regulatory approach in dealing with issues relating to net neutrality? Please comment with justifications.**

Since a violation of net neutrality threatens the very foundations of the Internet, delicensing of an ISP must be the only regulatory response to repeat violators.

Due to the decentralized nature of ISPs, network administrators at various levels might use traffic management techniques that violate net neutrality. Having delicensing as retaliation for this will ensure organizational discipline at all levels to respect net neutrality.

**Q4. What precautions must be taken with respect to the activities of TSPs and content providers to ensure that national security interests are preserved? Please comment with justification.**

While there needs to be a balance between individual privacy and national security, aside from obtaining legal warrants for specific connections under suspicion, there must be minimal state intervention. Since VPNs and messengers with end-to-end encryptions are widely available and continue to proliferate, a “blanket” of requirements to TSPs (such as logging websites visited by consumers) is both undesirable and unlikely to succeed.

As for content providers, existing laws and reporting systems exist to block access to websites.

**Q5. What precautions must be taken with respect to the activities of TSPs and content providers to maintain customer privacy? Please comment with justification.**

Dumb pipes must be maintained, with the exception of knowing which subscriber an IP address corresponds to.
Logging of internet activity must be avoided as far as possible, for reasons mentioned in the answer to the previous question.

**Q6. What further issues should be considered for a comprehensive policy framework for defining the relationship between TSPs and OTT content providers?**

It is not far-fetched to say that most calling and text communication will happen over the internet within the next decade. This transition is currently underway. As VoLTE is supported by an increasing number of handsets, it is important that net neutrality laws with regard to VoIP are forward-looking, and not concerned with the immediate business concerns of telecom companies.^4

By yielding to these complaints, the Regulator might risk slowing down the penetration of internet and the evolution of network infrastructure. This is entirely undesirable, considering the hitherto slow evolution of ISPs’ quality of service. And seeing how the growth of the internet is inextricably linked to the growth of the economy, net neutrality laws must be robust. OTT services must therefore not be limited in any way to accommodate TSPs.

Thanking you,

"Aadhaar linkage defeats the very purpose it is being brought in, for. Linking them to bank accounts is the best way to park black money, make financial transfers un-auditable and launder money.",16,6i6sn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6i6sn5/aadhaar_linkage_defeats_the_very_purpose_it_is/,5,1497911844.0,"RBI is empowered by the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to regulate payment systems in the country. (https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Publications/PDFs/86706.pdf)

- It's payment and settlement systems requires compliance to international standards. 

- It should have access controls, be equipped with safeguards to prevent external intrusions, provide audit trails. (http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs98.pdf). 

Electronic funds transfers includes point of sale transfers, ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawal of funds, transfers initiated by telephone, internet and, card payments. 

- For over a decade banks have used RBI’s own payment system NEFT to facilitate your online money transfers (https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=2346). 

- Your money is transferred to the recipient's account in hourly schedules to settle payables & receivables from each bank from in that hour. In case, your transfer fails, your money is back in your account. 

- If you make larger transfers, say Rs2 lakh and above, then you will have to use RBI’s RTGS to make the transfer(https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=65). In this case the gross amount is moved from your account to the recipient account directly. In case the transaction fails your money is reversed back to you. 

- You need to be logged into your bank account to initiate an NEFT or RTGS transfers. Only a valid bank account can receive funds making electronic transfers the bank and the trace of money cannot be altered. 

- As NEFT & RTGS transfers leave a audit trail that cannot be altered they cannot be used for money laundering. 

Aadhaar-Enabled Payment System or AEPS facilitates deposit & withdrawal from Aadhaar-Enabled Bank Accounts (AEBA)[https://authportal.uidai.gov.in/home-articles?urlTitle=aadhaar-enabled-payments]. AEPS must be licensed by RBI under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. National Payments Corp of India or NPCI, a non government public company, runs the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS)(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCqjSA1WsAAU6_H.jpg). UIDAI has a MOU with NPCI. UIDAI has no responsibility for your transactions & NPCI has no obligation to RBI. AEPS facilitates the withdrawal & deposit of money from AEBA accounts or bank accounts where an Aadhaar number is linked to the bank account. Linking Aadhaar to a bank account is done through a process called as “seeding” an Aadhaar number to a bank account. After receiving the Aadhaar number from the customer, the bank uploads such numbers’ into a “NPCI mapper” or a repository of Aadhaar numbers. The NPCI mapper is used for the purpose of routing transactions to the destination banks. The NPCI mapper contains Aadhaar number & IIN, a unique 6-digit number issued by NPCI to the participating bank [NPCI FAQ on AEPS](http://www.npci.org.in/documents/CustomerFAQs.pdf). If anyone seeds a new bank AC with your Aadhaar only that banks’ IIN will be associated with the Aadhaar(http://www.iba.org.in/upload/MicroATM_Standards_v1.5.1_Clean.pdf). Once Aadhaar enabled, you can make money transfers from your AEBA by providing the source and destination IIN and Aadhaar number. It is not impossible for anyone in possession of your Aadhaar to open multiple accounts linked to your Aadhaar. It is therefore possible for alternate accounts to receive money transferred to your Aadhaar & then point the mapper back to your original account. This destroys the trace of which account the money was deposited to or even came from. Such un-traceability allows different accounts to “park” money at different times or even become conduits for money transfers. Such accounts can also become conduits to claim undeserved benefits from Consolidated Fund of India that would never be traced once released. Such a system would make it near impossible to detect fraud & crime. This is a recipe for embezzling government treasury with no complaints, no audit trail and no punishment. Bankers call any transactions that are not traceable as money laundering. Aadhaar Leaks exposed hundreds of million Aadhaar numbers & bank accounts that exposing them to such misuse. Even if Aadhaar numbers were proof of identity, which it is not, linking them to bank accounts is the best way to park black money, make financial transfers un-auditable, propagate money laundering and financial fraud. By enabling Aadhaar linkages with bank accounts, the government is enabling fraud propagation across the entire banking industry that will result in widespread and irreversible damage. 

PIL 932/2013 not heard since 2013 before the SC has challenged Aadhaar linkages to banking and prayed for delinking Aadhaar from banking. If this investigation into Aadhaar linkage is not sufficient to make a prudent banker lose sleep, we may not have any prudent bankers left. Do our policy makers have the time or inclination to apply themselves to protecting national interest & assets? Or to reflect on the implications of their actions or to seek counsel & protect the nation and its assets? Embroiling the unbanked & banked into this mess is no financial inclusion - it is a debt warrant. The government is subverting justice by not allowing the SC to hear & judge the matter. This is not a matter of deciding privacy, it is about national interest & our economy. When impacts are not localized and non spreading, interdependence increases propagating impacts. This results in irreversible and widespread damage and the probability of devastation, ultimately to the point of certainty. Aadhaar is propagating exactly such impacts that are not localised or non-spreading. 

Containing the nations risk from “black swans” requires applying the precautionary principle.
(http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/pp2.pdf). An essential feature of a payment system is to guarantee the trace of payments should not be alterable. Another feature is that it should not be possible to freeze your bank account without recourse to redressal & justice. NEFT and RTGS are RBI’s own payment systems that have been time tested. There is no reason to switch public payments to any other payment system, particularly one run by non-government private companies. The replacement of a time tested standard under government regulation by a non-government company raises several questions. This thread is based on article previously published in Sep 2014 (http://www.moneylife.in/article/how-aadhaar-linkage-can-destroy-banks/38736.html). Scenario today worse as warnings have gone unheeded.

**Return Of The Avengers**

Whoever says Hollywood’s superhero movies are unrealistic? The Avengers are actually real. Hollywood’s Avengers was a group of superheroes saving the universe by blowing stuff up. In reality, the Avengers are a group of guys that just blow stuff up for no real reason. The Niger Delta Avengers militant group has been [blowing](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/07/oil-hovers-near-8-month-highs-on-us-inventory-draw.html) up oil wells in Nigeria and has rejected any peace talks with the government. After dropping to dangerous lows of $20, crude oil prices have bounced back and recently crossed the $50 mark. Much of the reason for this rise is simply the forces of supply and demand reacting to each other in a free market. But one of the reasons it touched $50 last week was the Avengers sabotaging oil wells. A lot of investors betting on the resurgence of oil can’t say this out loud, but thank god for terrorist Avengers. However, not everybody is celebrating the return of oil. In the latest policy review, the RBI (which kept interest rates untouched last week), [cited](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/black-gold-a-headache-not-only-for-modi-but-for-raghuram-rajan-too/articleshow/52634156.cms) rising oil prices as a risk. Because when oil prices go up, inflation goes up as well. Personally, I’m just sad that budget cuts forced the Avengers to opt for simple dynamite instead of nuclear-powered Mach-5 flying suits.

**Black Problems**

India has a huge second economy that deals with black money. That’s news to nobody. But a new study has [pegged](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/new-study-pegs-black-money-in-india-at-rs-30-lakh-crore/story/233395.html) the size of that black economy at an astounding 20% of GDP or over ₹30 lakh crore (that’s 3 followed by 13 zeroes). And that just happens to be bigger than the overall economic size of countries like Thailand or Argentina. While the size of India’s black economy expanded rapidly during the 70s and 80s, it has been gradually declining since then. Today, most of this money is locked up in physical assets like real estate or gold. Due to obvious reasons, there are no official figures but experts say that as much as 30% of India’s real estate sector is funded by black money. Really, only in economics can you root for the supremacy of white over black and not be called a ~~Donald Trump supporter~~ racist.

**The Curious Case Of Missing GDP**

How does a 7.9% growth in GDP sound to you? If you ask the average joe on the streets, he won’t know what is what. But if you ask the fairly well-read joe on the streets, he’ll tell you that a 7.9% growth rate is amazing. But what about a 3.9% growth in GDP? Now, that’s bad. Official numbers released last week say that India’s GDP in the March quarter grew by 7.9%. But wait, there’s more. The accuracy of those numbers has been [called](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/kvvDHfbryOQjvu2l16UcEI/Discrepancies-drive-GDP-growth.html) into question. When you break GDP down into its components, sometimes the data doesn’t add up. It’s life. Sometimes, things just don’t add up. So this gap is then plugged by calling the missing portion as a ‘discrepancy’. As long as this discrepancy doesn’t get too big, all is well. But the amount of discrepancy in the latest numbers has shot up by over 350%. And if you remove the amount put under ‘discrepancy’, GDP growth rate falls from 7.9% to 3.9%. Faking GDP numbers? Come on guys, that’s not our job. That’s China’s [job](http://fortune.com/2015/12/14/china-fake-economic-data/).


**Economic Story Because Export and Import**

Nuclear weapons are serious business. Emphasis on serious rather than business. Although a handful of companies do make money off the nuclear power business. When sensitive nuclear technology falls in the wrong hands, you have rogue nations like North Korea and when it falls in the right hands... well, there really aren’t any right hands for nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a group of 48-countries that controls the export and import of goods that can be used to make a nuclear weapon. The NSG does this to ensure that nuclear technology doesn’t fall in the wrong hands. But India is not one of its 48 members. One of the reasons we are not invited to parties thrown by the NSG is because we have nuclear weapons but haven’t signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is an international agreement designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. This is a sore point with a lot of countries like China who are against India joining the NSG. However, being being friends with the United States, the world’s superpower does come with a lot of benefits. A US-led push to include India in the NSG is [picking](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-nuclear-idUSKCN0YV13Z) up steam as nations like South Africa and Turkey are coming around to supporting India’s bid for a membership. Here’s the irony - the only reason the NSG even exists as an international group, is because India tested nuclear weapons in the 70s and that rustled some jimmies in the international community.

Earlier this year, the Indian government once again tried to get the famed Kohinoor diamond back from the UK and failed. Citing that it would set an “unworkable precedent”, UK Prime Minister David Cameron [refused](http://www.newsweek.com/kohinoor-diamond-india-colonialism-449951) to return the stone, which has been claimed by the governments of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan at various points as well.

I have been writing about interesting things happening in our Parliament for the past few months (with crazy GIFs) like: Foreign funding to political parties, restructuring of the RBI, babu-power to make laws, immigration for the people of only *certain* religions etc.

A lot of the things I have written about will also find resonance in this session. Sharing a few relevant ones in this post. (The complete list of articles can be found [here](https://www.newslaundry.com/author/meghnad-s).)

- Starting with, of course, [The Great Indian Demonetization](https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/11/15/the-great-indian-demonetization). The public will benefit from this move in the long term, but there is someone else who will benefit on holy-mother-of-godly-jesus levels: Indian Bankers. (Sidenote: This is actually a continuation of a post I had made here in /r/india in Feb - [Our Banks are in trouble and we need to talk about it](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/47ogw5/our_banks_are_in_trouble_we_need_to_talk_about_it/))

- [The Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016](https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/11/02/want-to-be-an-indian-citizen-its-easier-if-youre-hindu) will come up for consideration in the winter session. It has a strange provision in it. It’s will become easier to become a citizen if you’re non-Muslim. 

- Some significant rules are about to be laid in Parliament too. We need to keep a track of [what our dear babu-log are upto](https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/11/09/the-power-of-babus).

- During discussions on economy & demonetization, you will hear about lowering interest rates. It is now being done in shiny new ways because the RBI has been completely restructured. [Raguram Rajan's successor is a committee!](https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/08/27/raghuram-rajans-successor-is-a-committee)

- GST is going to make a comeback & there will be a lot of talk about 'Asset Reconstruction'. In the last session, the Voldemort Bill was passed which would be even more significant after demonetization. Here is [a simplified guide for both](https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/08/06/the-voldemort-of-bills-got-passed-and-you-didnt-know).

- And finally, there are some very interesting Private Members' Bill that might come up this session. Marijuana legalization, Transgender Bill AND, hopefully, one more which one has a vested interest in. (*wink wink*) Here is why [PMBs are vital & need to be given importance](https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/09/20/its-a-private-member-affair). 

**Other EPIC shit happening in the Policy Space**

- Take a look at the PRS Legislative Research's [pending Bills track](http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/pending/). It will let you see which are the bills that might come up for the upcoming session and what is their status in the Parliament right now. Alongwith some really good briefs, of course.

- PRS Legislative has also starting doing [video briefings for bills](http://www.prsindia.org/videos/bill-videos), which is worth checking out. 

- If you want to follow the Parliament LIVE on Twitter, go ahead and follow @HasParlAdjYet. A few good souls I know have assembled to painfully document every movement in the Parliament and document it on twitter.

- There is this new website called nyaaya.in. They are working hard to simplify complex laws for public consumption and understanding. Check out their [really good website](http://nyaaya.in/)

- A very enterprising person I know has started an effort called Maadhyam. She is giving bill briefings on pending bills and trying to get public inputs on them. She will then make briefings for MPs and circulate it to them. At the moment, [Maadhyam operates on Offprint](http://www.offprint.in/article/2322/). Do check that out as well.

- Also, Bonus Video which kinda explains [why things are the way they are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs). Rules for Rulers. Made a LOT of things clearer for me as a dispassionate (and kinda depressed) observer of the political system.

I hope these tools help you follow Parliament & makes things a little more interesting. 
Let the Hunger Games... I mean... Winter Session of Indian Parliament, commence!

Kumbhakaran

Demonetisation - Long Term Impact (after we are all dead) [P],17,5esf30,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5esf30/demonetisation_long_term_impact_after_we_are_all/,20,1480087869.0,"In his speech on the demonetisation issue, Manmohan Singh, Ex-PM of India, quoted John Maynard Keynes’ clichéd *‘In the Long run, we are all dead’* to downplay the long-term positives of demonetisation exercise. 

However, one hopes, he would have instead focused on the long-term negatives of Demonetisation. 

The political leanings, short-termism have become so important in current times that the people sympathetic to BJP will not see anything negative in the move and people opposed to it would only look at the issues which can emote with the larger population like immediate suffering of people. Those opposed are only looking at short term negatives, which are transitory in nature, for quick karma and gains. 

In that light, we have all come to believe that demonetisation is good but implemented poorly. Even Manmohan Singh, indirectly accepted it. Unfortunately, he didn’t elaborate on his comment of calling it an organised loot and legal plunder.  

Manmohan Singh said that he is fine with the objectives but not with the implementation. However there is third angle to it, that of the *’Method’*.  Attacking black money is the Objective, Demonetisation is the Method and the exchange of notes, deposits and withdrawal are about Implementation. 

We have all come to a near consensus that implementation is a problem (I have different thoughts on it, but that is irrelevant to the topic I am discussing). We all agree that the growth and economy will suffer for the next quarters because of this. We also agree on certain positives like lower inflation (Demonetisation being deflationary), lower interest rates, possible increase in tax-base, a possible change in attitude and behavior of some businesses (as they start paying due taxes) and also Schadenfreude. 

However some of the long term benefits are overstated while some of the negatives are not being focused upon at all. 
We first though need to agree on what Demonetisation is ‘not’ intended to do, irrespective of the popular opinion and the statements by the Government. People use some of these points to wrongly attack Demonetisation, whereas the genuine reasons to criticize are being omitted. It will for example not decrease corruption (where Government itself is involved) although the current stock of corrupt money might get impacted. 

Now, the long term, the real long term, negatives (or shall we say possible risks), I foresee are:

**Gold and Dollar**- Despite the popular opinion that gold prices and gold consumption would be hit, I believe in the long term and the real long term Indians would buy even more Gold. We are already the biggest consumers and we will likely become even bigger. 

Human Psyche gets invariably impacted by events of prolonged stress which alters the behavior permanently. We start making choices subconsciously that we would not make otherwise. The years of controls/licences/shortages instilled that behavior in our previous generations and turned them into hoarders, stingy and untrustworthy of currency and vary of inflation. That promoted gold purchases and investment in real estate. They, at least those who can afford, would keep 3-4 months of expenses in cash whereas the current generation wouldn’t do it even for week’s worth of cash expenses. They would keep sub-optimally higher amounts in ‘saving accounts’ for contingencies and not invest it properly as future cashflows were always uncertain. An so on… 
What the demonetisation would likely do is to lower faith in Indian currency and leading the corrupt, tax-evaders and most importantly even the upright citizens to have some liquid assets in non-Rupee forms. That’s Gold and US Dollar. 

This would, longer term mean, higher current deficit and non-productive investments.  

**Cash/GDP ratio** - On of he stated target of Demonetisation is to lower the Cash/GDP ratio in India which at 12% is considered high.  Flushing our black money and promoting digital transactions are the steps in that direction. 
However, it might not only backfire but could possible increase the ratio in Long-term (as in 3-5 years out). If the restriction on the cash withdrawals continue beyond December or if some permanent policies are made to discourage or restrict cash withdrawals, it will encourage the people to have a bigger cash-stash at home for emergencies. Even if the moves restricting withdrawals aren’t permanent this behavior might become permanent. I do not keep much cash at home. However, the current problems added with some medium term policies, running into 2017, might lead to a sub-conscious change in my behavior leading me to keep 2-3 months worth of expenses in cash. My young daughter would likely also pick that habit up, unknowingly, making it a serious long term issue.  

The behavior change in the population, outside the sub-set of corrupt and tax-evaders might actually increase the long term cash/GDP ratio in India. 

**Currency**- The currency of a country is the best measure of its economic power. US Dollar is a reserve currency globally and everyone trusts it. When America sneezes, the world catches cold and the Dollar strengthens. That’s so counter-intuitive but reflects the might of the dollar. It also gives US free money to some extent adding to its prosperity. Only Japanese Yen and Euro are comparable, albeit distant cousins. Aussie Dollar, Canadian Dollar, GBP, Swiss Franc too have credibility. China has been trying to gain that credibility for RMB. They want it to become a reserve currency. They want their currency to give them power which some of the Western currencies enjoy and leverage. India is not at a stage to even attempt that. However 20 years out, it might be. Demonetisation though reduces the credibility of Rupee. The thinking would go like this, despite the best intentions- If India can do it once, it can do it again; if India could replace can it also confiscate; If there are risk let’s lower Rupee exposure. 

This one is real long term issue. However we might have pushed our ambitions of making Rupee acceptable globally by a decade or two with demonetisation.

**Trust**- The world functions on trust. A contract should be honored in all cases, even if the other party turns to be criminal in some other unrelated case. If I owe someone an amount, I will owe it to him, even if he kills his mother. The cash notes are a promise and a contract. Honest people will trust it, if the contract is honored even for dishonest, corrupt and criminals. This move would lower the trust in Indian currency for a very long time. It might get reflected in many ways ranging from gold-hoarding to diversification in other countries and markets. 

**Wealth transfer**- In a perverse way Demonetisation is turning out to be a wealth transfer from the corrupt and tax-evader to even more corrupt and opportunist. The agents, jewelers, bank employees and the people offering their time and accounts for conversion of old notes into new are the gainers at the expense of the previous set of corrupt. It looks unlikely that very large portion of old notes would stay out as most people will manage to convert it, as most economists have pointed out.  This would mean a failure of demonetisation in it’s primary objective. However there is likelihood that I might have misunderstood the objective. It might very well be to Tax the unaccounted wealth at higher rates of 60%-90%. The long term problems of this aspect aren’t clear to me but gut feel tells that this too would manifest itself in changed behavior of the populace.  ",5

**Last Week On Rajan Watch**

Last year, PM Modi called RBI Governor Rajan as the “best teacher” for explaining complex economic issues to him. Days later, Rajan said the teaching went both ways. Aww. But the bromance doesn’t end there. Reports saying the PM is “proud” of Rajan surfaced last week [stating](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rajan-insight-idUSKCN0YM2SC) that any campaign against Rajan will not affect the big decision that he needs to make on Rajan’s reappointment. That might’ve been a snide reference to MP Subramanian Swamy’s moves to remove Rajan, Swamy has even rebuked Rajan for “speaking like a grandfather” (what? with artificial teeth? I mean Rajan is already 53, while Swamy is 76). Being best buds with Modi will definitely help Rajan secure his governorship at the RBI for a second term. But then, later in the day, reports [surfaced](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-doesnt-want-extension-media-report/articleshow/52536142.cms) that Rajan doesn’t even want to continue as Governor and would rather be a spectator in the game by going back to teach in the US and continue research on the Indian economy. Apparently, his family has already left. Somebody better buy the rights to this reality show - I’m personally hanging by the edge of my seat. Rajan is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the interest rate meeting this week. And the markets are expected to worry more about the “Rexit” - Rajan exiting the RBI than the interest rates this week. 

**Lincoln Could Only Do So Much**

When you have North Korea, Uzbekistan, Cambodia and Qatar at the top of a list - you pretty much know that the it isn’t the list of world’s happiest countries, it just has to be a list about something bad. Last week, India [shared](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-18-35-million-people-india-tops-global-slavery-index-1413891) a spot on such a list with all of these countries and it was the list that ranks countries in terms of slavery. Yikes. Owning a person might’ve gone out of fashion decades ago, but the trend is still alive - With a global figure of 46 million modern-day slaves, India is home to 18 million of those modern-day slaves followed by 3 million in China and 2 million in Pakistan that are implicated in domestic work, prostitution, manual labour, forced begging and so on. Even in manufacturing, working conditions at factories contribute a lot to the problem by essentially turning employees into slaves. Prominent for workplace [violations](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/01/gap-walmart-factory-workers-exploited-and-abused-in-india) are factories that supply global multinationals like Walmart or Gap. They’ve been known to have working conditions that don’t just border on exploitation - but are miles away from that border, deep into exploitation territory. Complaints include non-payment of wages, forced overtime work, inability to form unions, extreme health consequences that may be fatal due to lack of safety regulations and even sexual harassment. How’s that 9-to-5 desk job sounding now?


**Follow The Money?**

In 2014, between the time when Modi was elected and the time when Modi was sworn-in as the PM, the Sensex was [up](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/narendra-modi-vs-bse-sensex/) 1,685 points. Clearly, the stock market loves Modi. But Modi thinks of the stock market as just a friend. Asset disclosures have [revealed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/pm-modi-top-ministers-stay-clear-of-stocks-keep-assets-in-realty-banks/articleshow/52413153.cms) that the PM has 79% of his total assets, which amount to a total of ₹26.1 lakh, in real estate and a big fat 0% in stocks. The stock market was friend-zoned not just by the PM, but by his cabinet as well. While the total assets of the top 9 ministers in the Indian government amounted to a staggering ₹91.1 crore, only 2% of them were invested in the stock market. The richest of the bunch was Arun Jaitley, perhaps appropriately the Finance Minister, who has total assets of ₹49.5 crore, a significant portion of which is just cold hard cash sitting as bank deposits. The poorest of the bunch was Suresh Prabhu, perhaps also appropriately the Railway Minister, who has total assets of mere ₹17 lakh. You want to talk about the gap between the rich and the poor? We’ve got that gap right here for you in government’s *navratnas*. 

**Time for Tim: Cook’s India Aftermath**

Tim came, Tim saw but Tim did not conquer. Tim Cook, Apple CEO, visited India a few weeks ago to much media fanfare and met several top government ministers. But to Tim’s disappointment, he failed to convince anyone to allow Apple to launch its famous retail iStores in India. Currently, Apple sells products through a network of dealers. That’s because under current regulations, if Apple wants to open retail stores, it needs to source 30% of content locally. Sourcing 30% locally means Apple would have to start manufacturing in India. Either that, or just buy stuff from local businesses and literally light it on fire. Neither of those things is about to happen. However, under current regulations, Apple can be granted a waiver to the 30% rule but only if Apple is bringing “cutting-edge” technology to India. And in the classic bureaucratic fashion, nobody actually bothered to define what “cutting-edge” would mean. And when you leave crucial terms like that open for interpretation, somewhere somehow a lawyer gets all excited. Now, Apple fanboys might disagree on this but government officials are unlikely to call any of Apple’s technology “cutting-edge” and are widely [expected](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/lDn53REhqvhqGoIxs9MgwJ/Apples-proposal-to-sell-refurbished-iPhones-in-India-reject.html) to decline Apple’s petition for a waiver of the 30% rule. The government is also not a big fan of Apple’s proposal to sell second-hand iPhones in India fearing that the country would become a graveyard for all old iPhones.

New legislation [proposed](http://qz.com/695185/finally-india-wants-to-clamp-down-on-savings-schemes-that-have-duped-investors-of-billions-of-dollars/) by the government aims to streamline the process for investigating ponzi schemes and to impose strict jail terms up to 10 years for offenders.

Now that I have your attention, the job isn’t tiring or gross either. The job is ...to exist. Swiss citizens [voted](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36454060) down a universal income proposal that would guarantee a minimum income of ₹1.7 lakh/month to every Swiss citizen.

**Going Gaga Over GST**

Last week, the Rajya Sabha [passed](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/gst-bill-pass-what-next-step-by-step-until-the-rollout-2952723/) the Goods and Services Tax (GST) - the tax reform that has been heralded as the most important piece of legislation in over a decade. While the common market of Europe is walking backwards due to Brexit, the common market within India is stepping ahead due to GST. The bill has been the subject of political bickering for a long time now. However, it was passed with 203 votes for and none against. With 0 votes against. They didn’t even blink twice, so you know there families weren’t being held hostage and all votes were entirely voluntary. But this has only been the tip of the iceberg. Even though both houses of the parliament have passed the bill, there is a laundry list of things that need to happen before we can all go home and forget about this whole GST business. The Lok Sabha needs to approve the bill once again. Then, a minimum of 15 state governments need to pass the bill. Then, the president needs to sign the bill. Then, a GST Council needs to be formed and the GST tax rate needs to be negotiated. Then, the central government needs to pass two supporting laws, and each state needs to pass a separate supporting law. And only then, we’ll be able to pocket all that cash from the GST-led economic growth that is being predicted. The deadline set for all of this is April 1st, 2017. Till then, government officials around the country are set to debate on extremely sensitive issues like whether cream biscuits should be taxed at the same rate as ordinary biscuits. #TeamBourbon.

**Uber-Didi**

Uber joined the long list of American MNCs that came to do business in China but inevitably fell on their faces. In a deal announced last week, the popular ride-hailing service will sell its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in [exchange](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/business/dealbook/china-uber-didi-chuxing.html?_r=0) for a 20% stake in Didi, who will invest $1 billion in Uber. The two giants have been battling for the Chinese market for years and despite spending billions of dollars, no one has managed to turn a profit. In fact, Uber was facing a loss of $1 billion annually due to heavy competition in China. Once upon a time, Uber’s future in China seemed to hold promise. And now, the company is throwing in the towel. The company’s mistake? It tried to fight a land war in Asia. Although Didi was the bigger company in China in terms of market share, Uber did have its moments. Such as when a Chinese hip-hop artist posted a gangster rap song about how much he prefers Uber. Don’t Baidu it - China being China censored the whole thing just days later.

**Loans For *Pani Puri wala*s**

Banks use all sorts of fancy algorithms to determine if a borrower will repay a loan. Despite all of that, with the banking crisis, a huge amount of loans are at a risk of being Vijay Mallya-ed. So the fancy algorithms haven’t exactly worked out. Another one of those fancy things that banks use is a credit score. A good credit score will have banks lining outside your door shouting for your attention. A bad credit score will have you lining outside the door of the banks with a ton of paperwork. You need a good credit score to get loans. But to get a good credit score, you need to repay loans. So you see the chicken-and-egg problem here. This means a lot of people don’t even have credit scores. But those people still need loans. And banks won’t touch them with a ten-foot pole. Now, microfinance companies like Edelweiss, Bharat Financial, DHFL and many more are going places feared by the big boys of finance. A big push in the industry is to loan [money](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/saturated-cities-now-even-idli-vada-seller-can-get-loan/articleshow/53515598.cms) to pavement hawkers, scrap dealers and other self-employed individuals. For example - the makers of the extremely healthy chinese food at the hand-kart that parks near the local sewer every evening. Basically, giving loans to low-income borrowers without a credit score or any kind of formal financial history. If that sounds like a recipe for trouble, that’s because it is and we’ve already had that dish in the run-up of the financial crisis of 2008. And if history isn’t repeating itself here, it’s definitely rhyming.


**Too Many Branches Spoil The Bank**

The State Bank Of India has almost 17,000 branches which is very impressive. Especially since they get to brag about it in tables that rank banks by number of branches. But the bank isn’t doing itself any favours by putting 5 branches within a 1 km radius of each other, as is the case a lot of times with SBI. Because sometimes, it’s not the size that matters, it’s what you do with it that matters. And SBI is [considering](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/sbi-weighs-plan-to-shut-relocate-30-of-its-branches/articleshow/53494912.cms) a proposal to do away with such extra branches by consolidating them. It might make common sense to shut down branches when put like that, but then they won’t get to brag about how many branches they have. And investors love those kind of things. SBI is currently in the process of merging with its associate banks from Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore and so on. It expects to have that completed by March 2017. At which point, that 17,000 number will balloon up to 24,000 branches, compounding that problem. A global consulting firm, McKinsey which was hired by SBI has recommended shutting down upto of 7,200 of those branches. Moreover, bank branches are so *2000s*. Online is where it’s at.

IMHO Mallya is being targeted because he flaunts his personal wealth.,100,49xeun,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/49xeun/imho_mallya_is_being_targeted_because_he_flaunts/,30,1457704364.0,"Now lest we jump the gun on the title, I know he gave a personal guarantee on the loan. I know he was the promoter of the erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines. But you have to see that the same public banks who are now crying hoarse are the ones who decided to give him a second loan in 2010? 

Now we can say that he is an asshole, yes in the layman's perspective he is an asshole. But lets not forget its his personal wealth, not the company's. That is the basic premise of a corporate body, that you limit your liability to the extent you are part of the company. (I know personal guarantee and all). The same banks AFAIK, took equity in the company.

What we as a nation need to ask is, what is the liability of these banks? Not as equity holders, but as lenders, how is it that ICICI was able to sell its part of the distressed pie to an asset reconstruction company while our public banks were seen staring into space holding their weiners. Another issue here is Mallya afaik was lent in a more open and straightforward manner, whereas there are company's with private subsidiaries to which borrowed money was routed to and it disappeared, while their listed parents defaulted, mostly in infra projects. Here the Banks lent money in the false hope that the airline would turn around in that economy, which obviously it did not. 

Now to indulge in some whataboutism, why is it that other huge defaulters are not talked of? Are the banks acting on media pressure? Why should they act on it? 

At least I hope because of Mallya ji, there will be a debate on why there are such defaulters, and the Banks have to be bailed out with our money, as was done in this budget. 

We also need to get policy in place to prevent lending of bad loans in the future. Lest Banks stop lending altogether and then we have a huge problem at our hands. 

Remember its your money, there are other people too who have  it, not just the Mallyas.",5

[Rant]Indians see history only as grade boosters and not as an introspection.,19,681tm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/681tm1/rantindians_see_history_only_as_grade_boosters/,5,1493404322.0,"To middle class Indians, history is nothing but a subject that boosts your overall grades. Years of struggle is disregarded as merely points in a chapter. From the unfairness of the Minto-Morley reforms, to the execution of the Tsar in Russia, human history is that of struggle between progressiveness and conservatism (perhaps, ironically, I'm also simplifying history).

This is a tragedy, for a country that probably has a very complicated history, we probably learn some lines about some cultures but never bother to think about it.

""Society must look forward"", they told me. ""History is nothing but a bulk"", they say. Then why is it that we don't look forward, and are so backward then?

Why do we scribble on the walls of our most important historical monuments? Why do we humiliate and defile the work done by our ancestors?

History is a very complicated subject. It shouldn't be read/study only for employment, it exists to not to repeat the same mistakes done by humans. We study them, record them for a reason. Yet, we simple mug them up and disregard them. Taking your religious 'mantras' with a higher precedence.

We have a twisted view towards History, we cherry-pick the sweetest part of the cake and then blame the manager for it's sourness: 

We blame the Congress party for her socialist policies but we never thought of it why it exists in the first place? Did we forget a good majority of Indians were disgusted by the capitalist polices of the British empire or the success of planned based socialism in USSR? We blame the Communist government for the downfall of Bengal, yet the culprit of it's stagnation seems to be from the Freight Equalisation Policy by Gandhi, who has been depriving her resources long before the commies took over (i'm not saying Commies were any good/helped the economy though). 

Did we suddenly forget the riots/atrocities committed by the RSS, the same RSS that said they do it for the good of the Hindus yet they supported the Empire? Who's founder was a rationalist and was against cow-worship, yet the organisation became exact opposite of his vision?  

Yet here we are. All in a full circle. 

We want to take an aggressive (let's just be honest, there's nothing *passive* about this *aggression*, it's downright violent) action towards Kashmiris? Never wondering why they are fighting against the INA? Ever thought of a fact that maybe, MAYBE, they are fighting to at least stop the atrocities committed by the Indian Army?

Or the Naxalite movement (it's going to be a bumpy ride for me). As much as I'm angry towards the cowards of the Naxal movement, History has shown us time and time again that most Communist movements exists because of:

* huge income inequality 
* desire for [international communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_communism)
* [shitty economic policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War#Background) (true for the Naxalite movement) 
* [government's negligence towards it's people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905_Russian_Revolution) (true for the Naxalite movement)

Naxalite exists for the poor people, who for them, the current *gormint* has done nothing for them.(Whether it's good for the people or bad is totally debatable.) [But as I read more about the movement,](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/history-of-naxalism/story-4f1rZukARGYn3qHOqDMEbM.html) I kinda realised that reasons for the movement were basically consists of the points 3 and 4. Maoist sympathisers claim that Indian Constitution ""ratified colonial policy and made the state custodian of tribal homelands"", turning tribal populations into squatters on their own land and denied them their traditional rights to forest produce. 

But of course our *gormint* is the behst! They work on the interest of the [*majorities*](http://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2009/06/22/majority-rule-is-anti-democratic-philosophically-flawed-and-inconsistent-with-society/). Ours is a democracy right? We can never make any mistakes, right? /s

We have to stop this black and white view of the society, or history or anything in general. Pure science without any meaningful context of why we do it means Audrey Huxley's [""Brave New World""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World) is totally rational society and we should totally look forward to it. Context is *important*. Perhaps the most vital value of any form of thinking is context. You cannot make any ideas out of thin air without context hence it's value is crucially important. And same goes for our position in our society.

Unfortunately for us, we disregard context (of any kind).

I see that he hasn't stated his position or made his arguments at any point, just stated his opinions. Can a clash of opinions just be called a debate or a discussion?

I, for one, genuinely want to know if this is true. And if yes, how? Let's try to keep our political biases aside, it concerns our country and our lives. 

Regarding the Supreme Court, the OP refers to [the SC thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7c0mjv/an_institution_collapses_update_on_what_is/).

> Why does it matter?

> It implies that the Chief Justice can effectively stop any allegations of corruption against itself by refusing to let anyone else hear the matter. This is very significant for corruption, and also in light of the fact that **the current government is trying hard through the NJAC to take control of who becomes a Supreme Court judge.**

Last I checked, this happened - [SC Bench strikes down NJAC Act as ‘unconstitutional and void’](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-verdict-on-njac-and-collegium-system/article7769266.ece) and there haven't been any developments since. There have been secular and apolitical cases for NJAC before by reputed scholars in publications like thehindu, Indian Express etc.

> RBI after demonetisation

>> For argument’s sake, even if we accept that the demonetisation was not in the best interest of the Indian economy, could Patel have prevented this? Section 26(2) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, says that on recommendation of RBI’s central board, the government may, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that with effect from a date specified in the notification, any series of banknotes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender. And, Section 7 of the Act says, “The central government may from time to time give such directions to the Bank as it may, after consultation with the Governor of the Bank, consider necessary in the public interest.” So, the government’s advice to RBI on demonetisation is in accordance with the Act, which also permits the government to supersede the central bank if it believes RBI has failed to carry out its obligations.

It has always been this way, we had a media friendly governor but RBI has only had a semblance of independence and the govt has not tried to force any rate cuts, which still speaks volumes. The governor is still allowed to criticize policies (like waivers) and is doing his job on NPAs. I strictly urge people not to let out their disappointment of Rajan not getting a second term on the institution and current governor. 

> The media channels brought by BJP,

https://www.newslaundry.com/2014/02/05/who-owns-your-media-4

https://www.newslaundry.com/2015/11/30/the-reliance-effect-when-is-corporate-ownership-of-media-especially-dangerous

I think this is a genuine concern and the developments off late haven't been desirable, this really should be discussed more and the media will never discuss it. Media being generally politically owned/biased. 

>  The Finance bill which give political parties access to benaami funding.

I do not really know much about this so I'd rather not opine and let someone with more knowledge of the bill rather than cursory read of articles explain in detail how it makes things worse than they are.

> He is making the 0.001% at the top above law, almost god-like. This includes the business tycoons, senior most officials in the government, Ministers

This reads more like political statement without any subtantiation, and the response to it will be more based on personal perception of whoever is discussing. And as psychology tells us, our genuine perception can be the way we want it to be, based on our biases. Our minds work to confirm our worldview, not refute it.

What I know is that this country has always had that culture, in fact, most collectivist cultures do. Indian economy has always had heavy influence of the incumbent traditional business-houses. The public policy has always worked in a way to retain the incumbents rather than provide competition.

> senior most officials in the government, Ministers

And I suppose this is referring to the ordinance proposed by the Raje govt in Rajasthan? The senior BJP leadership stated they don't support it and afaik, even indicated that they'd take action against Raje were she to move forward with this. There were [voices against this in BJP](https://www.oneindia.com/india/not-only-opposition-some-bjp-leaders-also-against-rajasthan-govt-s-draconian-ordinance-2567599.html) itself and they've responded to the feedback.

What motivated me to post this? I'm a regular citizen who goes about his life in a distinctively apolitical fashion. I've enjoyed countless discussions here on this forum but I've sort of become apathetic, and I don't see the doom out in real life.

What are my genuine gripes with the Modi government? The big-brother like approach and linking everything to Aadhaar in the name of ""anti-black money"" movement, creating a surveillance state. The ""Project Insight"" (cue Avengers reference) of stalking people by the taxman, will it really be only for tax purposes? I doubt it. 

I acknowledge there are genuine concerns about the policies adopted by the current government and I want to know more about them, have a constructive discussion. I'd be more than happy to be proven wrong with proper sources and arguments. Afterall, it's impossible for a person to know every aspect of everything. ",5
How Democratic is India - The Journey of Free India - Analysis and Report.,14,6tvjpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6tvjpd/how_democratic_is_india_the_journey_of_free_india/,2,1502845827.0," Earlier today, I had submitted the following videos and asked a few questions for some critical thought and fair and unbiased analysis of our beloved country. Not many were interested and many even showed a dislike. However, I firmly believe that if we are to come into our true potential and progress endlessly, we need to ask these questions, find the answers, come up with solutions and start trying to implement these reforms. So, let me repost the videos and then I shall discuss the questions.


Look at these videos first:

Democracy - https://youtu.be/qhiwswf4Jlg     
Despotism - https://youtu.be/eLlLEtWEY4Y     



These are the questions I had asked - 

1. What do you think is the income inequality gap in our country?

2. What do you think is the status of the middle income groups in our country?

3. How much freedom of press and freedom of speech and political dissent is there in our country?

4. How much mutual respect do we share and how racist is India?
5. Where do you think that India stands on enlightenment (education not literacy, please)?

6. How much concentration of power is there in our country and how fair do you think India's elections are?

7. Where do you think that India is on a scale of 0 (Absolute Despotism) to 10 (Absolute Democracy)? How far do we need to go and how to go there?



1.***Let's address the Income Inequality of our country.***

Do you know that in India the top 1% people control the country's 58% wealth equivalent to the wealth controlled by the bottom 70% of the country's population?

With a total individual wealth of $5,600 billion, it’s among the 10 richest countries in the world – and yet the average Indian is relatively poor.

Compare this with Japan, the most equal country in the world, where according to the report millionaires control only 22% of total wealth.
Statistics show that while over the last two decades, the richest 10 per cent of the population have seen their share of income increase by more than 15 per cent,  the poorest 10 per cent have seen their share of income fall by more than 15 per cent.      
The India Exclusion Report 2016 says the post-1990 growth was up to 300% of the levels in the first four decades since Independence but the rate of poverty reduction slowed down from 0.94% per annum during 1981-1990 to only 0.65% between 1990 and 2005. The reason was dismal job creation.    
India’s experience contrasts with that of Brazil, Indonesia and, on some indicators, Argentina, which recorded significant progress in reducing inequality during the same period.     
In India, pensions cover only 40% of the elderly. The report raises pertinent questions regarding half of India’s 103 million elderly outside any social security scheme, 40% of disabled women in rural India without jobs and exclusion of the poor on account of digital illiteracy as the government pushes Digital India. Over 400 million unbanked people live in India.      
The study also said that India suffers from huge gender pay gap and has among the worst levels of gender wage disparity -- men earning more than women in similar jobs -- with the gap exceeding 30 per cent.    
  Take a look at this - https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/25/5a/19/255a191f02925cb0ec50a4c2d3367921--bangladesh-congo.jpg

Wealth Inequality is internationally determined by the Gini index.  It is rated from 0 to 100. 0 means no inequality, while 100 means total inequality of wealth (i.e. one person holds all the wealth)    
India’s Gini coefficient rose to 51 by 2013, from 45 in 1990, mainly on account of rising inequality between urban and rural areas as well as within urban areas. The IMF issued a warning - http://www.livemint.com/Politics/mTf8d5oOqzMwavzaGy4yMN/IMF-warns-of-growing-inequality-in-India-and-China.html     
The report stressed the need for broadening access to health, education and promoting financial inclusion and reducing inequality of opportunities to bring down overall inequality levels. It also stressed the need for effective fiscal policy that broadens the coverage of social spending but at the same time moves towards a progressive taxation system that taxes the rich more.

“.. if you use the extra tax revenue to invest in the health system, in the education of the bottom 50% or bottom 70% of the country, then, yes, increased tax of the rich in India would be actually good for growth. It would reduce inequality and at the same time increase growth."" - French economist Thomas Piketty on this report. 
 
Comparing Indis with one of the equivalent countries, South Africa, Oxfam report (to be published in 2017), India performs relatively poorly on both counts. Its total tax effort, currently at 16.7% of GDP, is low (about 53% of its potential) and the tax structure is not very progressive since direct taxes account for only a third of total taxes. South Africa, by comparison, raises 27.4% of GDP as taxes, 50% of which are direct taxes.

When it comes to the second indicator (levels and progressivity of social-sector spending), India compares less well. Only 3% of GDP goes towards education and only 1.1% towards health. South Africa spends more than twice as much on education (6.1%) and more than three times as much on health (3.7%). While it’s assessed as more unequal than India, South Africa rates much higher than India in its commitment to reducing inequality.

Oxfam has calculated that if India stops inequality from rising further, it could end extreme poverty for 90 million people by 2019. If it goes further and reduces inequality by 36%, it could virtually eliminate extreme poverty -  if India makes an effort, that is.

2.***State of the Middle-Income groups in India***

The growth of the middle-income groups is directly tied to the growth of the country. An expansion in the middle-income groups signals decreasing wealth equality as more and poorer people are economically lifted up as the rich pay their fair share. More equal economies gain growth faster and sustain it for longer periods of time. Education, health, life expectancy increase as a result.   
It has the lowest threshold for a person to be considered a middle class with an annual wealth of $13,662 (Rs 737,748 or Rs 61,480 per month).     
India accounts for 3% of the global middle class with 23.6 million people.    
The problem is that many reports cite the middle class using the country's poverty line as a reference point which in India is set at an unsustainably low point. So, millions of poor people are falsely reflected as middle-income groups. Another problem is considering income rather than wealth as a measure for defining the middle class which ignores security and sustainability and the fact that unemployment can vaporise the middle-class status if only income and not wealth is considered. These are some of the reasons why many reports show highly inflated numbers of Middle class in India.    However, there are surveys that have been done based on the wealth and they show that only 23.6 million people actually qualified for middle class contrary to the much cited 600 million number.     
That itself is concerning. However, out of 1.5 billion people, 23.6 million makes only 1.5% of the population a middle-class populace. 
On the other hand, with a similar population and GDP growth rate, China has around 7.2% of the country's population in the middle-class category.     
US has 50% population in the middle-income group.  56% in Canada, 64% in Spain, 72% in Germany, 74% in France and 80% in Denmark, Netherlands and Norway. (These 3 countries along with Sweden and followed by Canada should be the guidelines for any prosperity or freedom. They always rank the best in any aspect.)  

Now let's look at the median income.median income is what the people economically in the centre of the country earn. Meaning, half the people earn more than (upper limit not defined) that and half earn less (lower limit not defined). It gives a good picture of the economic welfare of the country.    
Take a look at this picture to see the household and per capita median income of various countries - http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/xnsmmuvwz0ww5ductyp7rq.png

India - household - $3168 and per capita - $616. 
Sadder still - https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ic36-h0ViIU/WDcz5ZZpgdI/AAAAAAAAIY8/tw968GlsSPsGop72aDTBNG6li5PTYpQMQCLcB/s1600/India-Pkistan%2BWealth%2BReport.png

There is no clear data on China.


3.***Let's talk about Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Press and Political dissent.***


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Press_Freedom_2017_RWB.svg

India ranks 136th out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index in 2017 - – lower than countries like Zimbabwe, Afghanistan and Myanmar. In 2016, it was 133rd.  In 2002, it was 80th in rank. The report clearly mentions that the ‘purging of anti-national thought in national debate’ has led to a decline in free speech. How can a media group deliver unbiased content, when free speech is denied to their journalists. This leads to more and more propaganda from the government so that the government can falsely attain the trust of people despite doing wrong activities and keep everyone in the dark. This makes people trust politicians more than they should and support everything they do and say not knowing that it actually hurts them. Does anyone remember the whole DeMo debacle and Modi's propaganda? The news channels he had shut down on the 9th, the number of journalists literally receiving death threats? Free speech is the 4th pillar of democracy and instead of rallying for free speech when traitors chant anti-national slogans, we should encourage political dissent from the government, critical thinking and open and fearless debate.    


4.***Mutual Respect in India***

Most Racist Country  -  Rank 1 - United States/ India.     
   
Least Racist Country - Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Canada (like I Said)


Communal violence    
India was ranked by Pew Research Analysis as the 4th worst country for communal violence, behind Syria, Nigeria and Iraq. India was followed by Israel and Pakistan ranked 10th. The position has worsened due to the incumbent government. 

I tried to check multiple polls and research but all of them show the same trend. 

Gender Parity - India ranks 87 out of 144 countries, US 45th, Canada 35th, Sweden 4th, Norway 3rd, Finland 2nd, Iceland 1st.

Even in 2017, most people in India identify themselves by their religion, geographical location (state), ethnicity, race, language/culture, ancestry, wealth, status, caste, profession etc before Identifying themselves as Indians. So how tolerant are we in India?

5.***Enlightenment***

India's education Index in 1980 was 0.24 and in 2017 it is 0.47 where 1 means 100% education.  China and Brazil - 0.66, USA - 0.89, Canada - 0.85, Germany - 0.88, Norway - 0.91, Australia - 0.92.       
But this is just literacy rate. Let's see higher education (tertiary or college level)  - 1st - Canada (54%) , 7th - USA (44%),  42nd - China (10%), India (not included in the ranking) (8.15%). While the Indian Ministry claims 26% people who have received a higher education but refuses to define higher education. No Indian University has been ranked in the top 200 Universities in the world.      
However, just having a higher education is not enough. One needs to have an education which lines up with the demand outside, innovation, opportunity etc - aka the 12 points competitive Index. India vs Asia - https://assets.weforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/india4.png

for the world -https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAcrAAAAJDJkOWVlNTIxLTMxZjMtNGNiZS1iOGRmLWUxY2M2M2Y2MzBjOA.png

In research and development investment, India ranks 38th, in innovations, India ranks 26th and 42nd in Overall Global Technology Index. - https://www.citylab.com/life/2011/10/worlds-leading-nations-innovation-and-technology/224/ 

6.***Concentration of Power and other things***

By authoritarianism (higher points mean more liberal lower points mean higher authoritarianism, India has the 32nd rank (7.81 points). Norway - Rank 1 (9.93 points), US 21st (7.98 points), Pakistan (for those who still compare India with Pakistan) 111th (4.33 points), China 136 (3.14 points). North Korea last at 167 with 1.08 points.

Corruption -  Corruptions Perceptions Index from 0 - 100. Higher the score, less the corruption. Denmark - #1 (90), USA - #18 (74) , India and China both at #79 (40), Pakistan #116 (32). The trend for India shows a betterment by 3 points from previous years.

So, in conclusion, if one defines and analyses Democracy (10) vs Despotism (0) according to the method in the videos, where would you rank India? I would rank India at around 4/10. What about you?

What reforms do you think would help India? What can you do to bring about the change you want to see in our beloved motherland?       

Happy Independence Day, Countrymen! Let's pledge to make India a better country by conscious effort, this Independence day in every aspect. Jai Hind!",5
Is AAP really offering something better than BJP?,37,1ub4s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ub4s3/is_aap_really_offering_something_better_than_bjp/,245,1388783604.0,"Some say,

>Let's not forget that AAP is indeed a big elephant in the room at the moment. And the traditional policies are still talking in the same old tune and concepts of communal lines and historical instances of judgement. 

Some reply,

>AAP is nothing but a *big bunch of petulant flimflammers*, promoted by the malicious, anti-Modi Media. Do your research; don't be swayed by the unnecessary hype.

Hence I call for a discussion. We all know why AAP has gained the popularity in recent times. But I don't think it is necessarily a good development and it is because of the following apprehensions:
 
 1.	**Skulduggery**: AAP made lofty, impragmatic and somewhat *unattainable* promises but didn’t get into cumbersome details; they kept it deliberately vague on how these promises would be kept. For example: The AAP spuriously promised to give 700 litres of free water to the poor. And according to Media reports, they delivered. All good then, right? But NO! THEY DID NOT DELIVER. They only gave it to metered houses not the poorest people in the slums who actually are in the need of that water. Besides, it, although subsidized, should not be free. There will be lack of motivation to save if it seems unrestricted even if it is only to a certain level. So it’s better for them to stay vague, and the argument stays emotional. Get specific, and there’s a rational argument. The AAP could lose both the argument and the votes. More on that below.

 2.	**Opposition to nuclear energy**. At a time when earth's survival is at stake and its resources are steadily shrinking and India luckily has 25-30% of the world's total thorium reserves (1,160 thousand tonnes), we now know that the AAP is OPPOSED TO NUCLEAR POWER IN GENERAL, how *cool* is that?^See ^[this](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-12-29/india/45674389_1_kudankulam-nuclear-power-project-aap-movement-against-nuclear-energy) ^and ^[this](http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/Bhushan-Assures-AAPs-Support-to-Agitation-Against-Nuke-Plant/2013/12/29/article1971627.ece?pageNumber=1&parentId=142539&operation=comment) They also oppose Kudankulam project in specific. India has a vision of becoming a world leader in nuclear power technology due to its expertise in fast reactors and thorium nuclear fuel cycle. Nuclear Energy can be nothing short of a BOON, a dream-come-true FOR A COUNTRY like India. Say goodbye to that Vision. Not even a month in power, they are already looking to “APPEASE”^[[1]](http://www.indianexpress.com/news/aap-to-support-nuclear-plant-stir-says-bhushan/1213139/) instead of thinking rationally? ([AAP wooing Muslims](http://muslimmirror.com/eng/aaps-fresh-bid-to-woo-muslims/)) Sounds similar to another party?

 3.	Their **flawed economic** model is the biggest problem.[[a](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-01-02/news/45799265_1_power-tariffs-aam-aadmi-party-aap)], [[b](http://www.firstpost.com/economy/between-the-state-and-markets-aaps-inherent-and-tragic-design-flaw-1319449.html)] Like I said before, their arguments are based more on emotional consideration than judicious thinking. The trickery behind their much touted instant delivery of poll promises is another matter of grave concern. Abusing subsidies is the easiest trick in the book. That doesn’t solve the fundamental problem which is “deficit”. Remember Islamic Hajj subsidy by congress? Now in contrast to Congress rule, they might look like shining star but we need more. Much more. Like Hardeep puri said, 
 >""Governance has to be based on understanding and sound considerations. If you are going to base concessions on subsidies, then you should know what it means. Subsidy by definition is a charge on the State exchequer. The State exchequer gets money from the taxpayer. So you are going to take the tax payers’ money and you are going to give subsidies to a limited section of the people. I want the AAP experiment to succeed but it cannot succeed on the basis of wasteful subsidies. [...] you can never build infrastructure on the basis of subsidies. Infrastructure and utilities like water and electricity, by definition, have to be PAID FOR. If you are giving subsidies on the supply of water and electricity, then you are obviously ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL."" ([Full interview](http://www.rediff.com/news/report/in-un-there-were-times-i-wished-india-had-a-stronger-govt/20140103.htm))

 Kejriwal’s only option was to develop *effective policy* and programme frameworks that reflect a balance between the state and the markets. This is the only realistic approach. However, Kejriwal have not yet opted for this synthesis and unless he does so, he cannot *really* deliver on the promises he has made to people. The new chief minister of Delhi is **thus caught between the rock and a hard place**. In Latin America, the combination of socialism and populism has been a bane. ([Read more](http://www.firstpost.com/economy/between-the-state-and-markets-aaps-inherent-and-tragic-design-flaw-1319449.html?utm_source=ref_article))

 4.	With US troops pulling out from Afghanistan thus leaving the region vulnerable to the threat of **re-talibanization**, along with *Chinese and Pakistani Armies* intruding Indian Territory *in tandem*, what Mr. Kejriwal CAN ENSURE is merely ""CLEAN"" GOVERNANCE BUT what WE NEED right now is beyond the capacity of Kejriwal, and that is a **MUSCULAR, nationalist** Government led by a solid, time-tested administrator who has the gumption to do what is needed and QUICKLY so. 

 5.	India needs **rapid growth** and **pragmatic policies.** *Modi indeed has gained the confidence* of business heads of countless nations like UK, Australia, Japan, Canada, etc. This is what Kejriwal does not and **will not have** in the next decade at least. Sadly for Kejriwal, we don’t have that much time. AAP, like congress, is a left-leaning party but we need the exact opposite a right-leaning party like BJP.

 6.	**Lack of credibility**. I would like to venture a guess that AAP, knowingly or not, is acting as a mask for congress, or rather a disguise! I think it is safe to say that Congress knows very well they cannot fight BJP using traditional means like hyperbole based on hollow claims and false promises, so they have created a unique army of veiled soldiers, AAP. They are looking to survive as a parasite sucking the resources out of AAP. That is the only way to ensure the perpetuation of the party and to *postpone* the **incarceration** of prominent congress leaders (including Congress chairperson madam Sonia). In 2004 elections they also used the phrase “aam admi” in their slogan — so this ploy is not at all new to congress. They know how to strike an emotional chord with gullible fools by making downright impractical promises only to be ensued by premeditated half-hearted attempts to fulfil those once they get power. But, just like in today’s Delhi, the poorest of the lot would be the biggest loser. AAP’s true colours came out when they accepted Congress’s support on Delhi despite the illustrious charade comprised of prevarications and avowals of their neutral repugnance towards the idea of getting into alliance with either the BJP or Congress. The fact is that both AAP and Cong are left-leaning parties. Although this may sound perilously close to a conspiracy theory there is more than a kernel of truth in it. There is probably collusion between CON and AAP top.([Congress using AAP to stop Narendra Modi](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-12-30/news/45711507_1_aap-nitin-gadkari-delhi-lokpal))

 7.	**Lack of Vision**. I don’t think it needs to be expanded on any more than it already has been. BJP has iconic and celebrated stalwarts like *Subramanian Swamy*, a veteran economist whose contribution to Indian economic reform is *unquestionable*, legal experience of *Arun Jaitley*, *Ram Jethmalani*, sheer political experience and proficiency of *L. K. Advani, Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj*, career diplomat like *Hardeep Puri* whose expertise in international diplomacy might just prove to be invaluable and, of course, administrator like *Mr. Modi*. What more can a nation want? And the best part is that all of them at least have a *vision* of how Indian republic should function and they are presenting it cogently and forthrightly. AAP doesn’t have a history yet and their track record is not indicative of any radically different point of view from that of the Congress when it comes to National security, energy, curbing *communal voices* and India’s rise, as a whole, in the community of nations. 

So I say let the AAP prove its worth by concentrating on Delhi for the next few years, solve its regional problems first. Let them explain their stance on such critical issues mentioned above and only after that can we really extrapolate the effects of AAP getting involved in the task of federal governance. Until such a time, voting for them in a general election will remain an unnecessary risk which is likely to cause more problems than it may solve.

I think there is much more.

Needless to say these are all my opinion based on my limited knowledge, please feel free to engage in a constructive discussion and avoid bringing in extraneous subjects. Thanks!

**UPDATE:**
--------
 [After Manmohan singh, AAP exerts Narendra Modi will be dangerous for nation](http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/after-pm-aap-exerts-narendra-modi-will-be-dangerous-for-nation_901267.html) - seems like AAP and CONG are already dancing in the same rhythm and AAP didn't waste much time before getting busy with age-old typical congress tactic - anti-campaigning.

**Some of the other problems:**

**The minority appeasement**. Meeting with [*Tauqueer Raza*](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-aap-leader-arvind-kejriwal-s-meet-with-muslim-cleric-maulana-tauqeer-raza-khan-ahead-of-assembly-elections-strikes-controversy-1914147) and then going on to defend him. AAP is doing the same things that Congress did. Indian society, I think, doesn't need any more of that.

**Their supercilious and self-righteous attitude**, they *just don't accept* that there are good non-corrupt people in all parties. Lots of people from Congress and BJP joined AAP and suddenly became non-corrupt while they were corrupt in their old parties.

By the way, I don't *hate* AAP for their crusade against Corruption, that is good. I believe their ideology and attitude are to the **sheer detriment of Indian economy and society at large**. I would even vote if there was an option of AAP-like party with right leaning economic ideology (some might say *BJP is that party* and quite rightly so).

Transparency:

Despite strong claims about transparency, *why* did the AAP try to muzzle the media *recently*?

**What I want you to answer:**
-------
Except for their infinite faith and ability to simply presume *good*, what do the AAP-supporters base their support on? *That* is my question! 

**In the long run, what can AAP give that the Congress didn't and couldn't?** How on earth is AAP different from Congress under the sun *today*? Same old *minority appeasement, same-old subsidy tricks, same old attacks on Narendra Modi*. Seems like AAP is the mirror image of Conrgess only under different guise.

Is there any explanation at all apart from Kejriwal's meaningless harangues on how ***everyone***, and no if - no but, *everyone* is just *CORRUPT*? 

**If they are so freaking corrupt why the heck are AAPians not putting them in jail instead of taking their *help*? This is what I want to understand.**

"Debunked: Airtel & Flipkart's false claim that 'Airtel Zero' does not violate net neutrality.""",245,323n1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/323n1k/debunked_airtel_flipkarts_false_claim_that_airtel/,31,1428684421.0,"After coming under attack from consumers airtel and flipkart have come on social media to peddle a lie, that airtel zero does not violate net neutrality because it gives free data. If you check their timeline they have been tweeting article (probably paid ones because they are mostly unheard websites) about how airtel zero does not violate net neutrality: [@airtelIndia](https://twitter.com/airtelindia)

Here is a TOI article [retweeted by Airtel^1](http://i.imgur.com/UXdmzc3.png) using two of their company accounts  where Flipkart CEO Sachin Bansal misleads everyone:

> [Airtel Zero not against net neutrality: Flipkart CEO](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/social/Airtel-Zero-not-against-net-neutrality-Flipkart-CEO/articleshow/46862879.cms)

Funnily enough airtel social media amateurs did not read the article beyond the headline, because the article itself says that this tie-up violates net neutrality:

>It's worth pointing out that Airtel Zero violates the principles of net neutrality as the company will offer an advantage to certain players in terms of cost of access and will even promote them. These players will most likely shell out a fee to get this favourable position. While Airtel will get an additional source of revenue, for service and app providers, it will be an additional expenditure just to ensure that they don't lag behind their competitors.

And it gives some free publicity to our campaign (haha!):

> To protest against Flipkart's move, some Indian Reddit users are also running a campaign where they're asking users to give Flipkart and Airtel apps a 1 star rating in Google Play Store and Apple App Store. The thread also asks users to drop a line about Net Neutrality to get the company's attention. A number of people have already left negative reviews as apparent from the app stores' review listings for the apps.

Now to debunk their claim, we don't need to do much other than just post policies which have already been implemented in other countries after careful consideration. Here is what Norwegian Communication Authority says on the matter which pretty much shows that MB companies (Mittal and Bansal) are lying to consumers in these press releases:

This means that in the Norwegian market zero-rating would constitute a violation of the guidelines.** At first glance it may appear that all traffic is handled equally in this charging model, but the fact is that once you have used your quota, the traffic that is exempted will be allowed to continue, while all other traffic will be throttled or blocked. This is clearly a case of discrimination between different types of traffic.

> There are of course arguments in favour of zero-rating that make the method seem quite fair. As consumers, we may find it advantageous that we do not have to pay (extra) for a particular type of traffic. **Nevertheless, zero-rating lead to selected traffic from the Internet service provider itself or affiliated providers being favoured above other traffic. And this is exactly the kind of situation net neutrality aims to avoid – allowing the Internet service provider to decide how we use the Internet. Instead, the Internet should remain an open, neutral platform for all types of communication.**

> The Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority (NPT) has long been working actively for net neutrality for the benefit of Norwegian consumers, organisations and businesses. **The Internet is important to economy, cultural diversity, social life and democracy, and NPT therefore works to preserve the Internet as an open platform. Internet service providers should use methods other than discrimination of content and/or applications to differentiate their products.** One possibility is differentiation on the basis of speed, in line with the Norwegian guidelines on net neutrality.

So if airtel wants to differentiate from Vodafone/BSNL they should provide better internet speeds, improve their customer service. If flipkart wants to compete with Amazon they should improve their website (and mobile website, because forcing their app is stupid), instead of using these unfair, anti-consumer policies.

*“[L&T is] my life and I have considered it as a temple with priority beyond my wife and children,”* - A. M. Naik, Executive Chairman of Larsen & Toubro, India’s largest engineering and construction company. Naik, who has worked at L&T for 52 years, will soon be [retiring](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/l-t-is-my-life-will-ensure-it-remains-in-strong-hands-naik-116071000259_1.html) and passing on the baton to a successor.

**Food (Wastage, Inflation)**

Shin Chan used to separate out *shimla mirch* from his meals and throw them in the trash because he didn’t like them. And also because he didn’t understand the economics of food wastage and inflation in modern India. A review by Economic Times last week [reported](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/food-wastage-can-cost-a-family-rs-80-lakh/articleshow/53127874.cms) that if the average family reduces food wastage by half and invested the savings at 10% returns, it can add up to ₹21 lakh in 30 years. However, that is not a static number since food prices tend to rise with inflation. And the inflation numbers for June [back](http://www.firstpost.com/business/cpi-inflation-at-5-77-should-ring-alarm-bells-for-new-rbi-governor-2890602.html) that claim. Food inflation was at 7.79% in June, up from 7.47% in May. Specifically, inflation in vegetables was about 14% in June, up from about 10% in May. So the next time your mother tells you to eat your vegetables, just pinch your nose and eat those godforsaken things that masquerade around as food. While that number only looks at food prices, consumer inflation which looks at prices in general stayed pretty much the same at 5.77%. Far from being a reason to pop open the champagne, “pretty much the same” still means a 22-month high. That 5.77% number should ring alarm bells for the RBI because if it crosses 6%, the RBI is required to explain to the government why it failed at keeping inflation in check. 

  

**The Business Of Cricket**

Baba Karl Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. But in India, you could easily replace religion with cricket in that sentence and it would still stand true. With cows being the only thing more sacred that cricket in India, all that religious obsession over cricket has made gods out of cricketers. And cricketers have raked in the money as they’ve turned themselves into a brand. Just a short list of businesses that Virat Kohli owns partly or entirely includes a chain of fitness centers, a clothing line, a tennis team, a football team, a wrestling team and a sport-based social network. And he’s adding one more to that list. Mr. Kohli is now a co-owner of his own [fanclub](http://yourstory.com/2016/05/virat-kohli-fanbox-privyplex/) called ‘Virat FanBox’ that sells a branded edition of Moto G smartphone that comes preloaded with his app that gives users exclusive access to him. With a price tag of ₹16,999, Virat FanBox also gets you a signed miniature cricket bat and one-year subscription to his fanclub. And of course, it has to come in a box, otherwise the name wouldn’t make sense. Time for a confession - that was news in May, not last week. Last Week In Indian Economy, bringing you week-old, and sometimes even months-old stale and smelly news since 2016. More recently though, last week Dhoni’s apparel and footwear brand Seven [marked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/dhonis-brand-seven-grosses-over-2-5-million-in-three-months/articleshow/53221126.cms) a milestone of $2.5 million in sales just three months after launching. 

  

**Gotta Catch ‘Em All!**

It started with Angry Birds. Then came Flappy Bird. And now we don’t exactly have another bird, but we have Pokemon Go. The augmented reality mobile gaming app has instantly catapulted to so much popularity that it is now bigger than Tinder and Twitter. The internet managed to give it the hug of death as well. With more than 15 million (official) [downloads](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pokemon-nintendo-business-implications-augmented-000000901.html) from 26 countries, the mobile game had to stop new players from signing up because the traffic had pushed its servers over the edge. Perhaps more noteworthy is the fact that it has managed to do the impossible. It’s managed to bring out hordes of nerds from underground basements to open-air gardens and parks, many of whom are just finding out that they are allergic to sunlight. It’s also managed to bring the stock of Nintendo up by 106% in the past two weeks. Nintendo owns 32% of The Pokemon Company, which is reportedly [making](http://www.wsj.com/articles/pokemon-chasing-investors-send-nintendo-shares-soaring-1468228206) an estimated $1.6 million per day in revenues from the game. For Nintendo, this couldn’t have come at a better time - the company’s profits fell by 61% last year due to weak sales of its console Wii U.

  

**Let The Games Begin! Again.**

The earnings season is here again. Which means newspapers don’t have to worry about filling empty space anymore. This earnings season was kicked off by three high profile names - Infosys, TCS and Reliance. As oil prices recover in the global market, petrochemical major Reliance [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/ril-q1-beats-estimates-profit4-grm-surges-to-361150bbl_7047161.html) a 4.4% increase in net profits beating expectations. The company’s currently busy preparing for a commercial launch of Reliance Jio, it’s foray into the telecom business. Moving over to names in the IT industry that reported earnings - When Donald Trump rants about foreigners stealing American jobs, this is part of what he’s unknowingly referring to. Both IT companies, TCS and Infosys are in the business of helping multinational corporations outsource their work and business is booming. But only for one of them. TCS [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tcs-q1-results-idINKCN0ZU15T) a better-than-expected 11% rise in net profit but dalal street had no love for the stock which remained flat. Perhaps due to fears over Brexit since the UK contributes 15% to the company’s revenue while the rest of Europe adds another 12%. On the other hand, while Infosys did post a 13% rise in profits, but it [lowered](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/infosys-posts-lacklustre-q1-result-slashes-outlook-2917009/) its predictions of the profit it might report throughout the rest of the year. Definitely no love for the stock which is down over 8%.

* Former RBI Governor D. Subbarao’s memoir called “Who moved my interest rate?” hit the stands last week. In the tell-all book that may cause some embarrassment to prominent leaders in the government, Subbarao [gives](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/d-subbaraos-memoirs-manmohan-singh-ignored-finance-minister-on-subbarao-term/article8850380.ece) all the dirty details of his stressful relationships with then finance ministers P. Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee. Since this book comes 3 years after his term as Governor ended, all we have to do now is wait 3 years for Raghuram Rajan (or “R3” as the social media calls him) to write a book revealing the real reason behind his resignation. Mark your calendars for 2019. 
  

* Recent research reports [indicate](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/earn/which-it-jobs-will-survive-automation-find-out/articleshow/53127553.cms) that Indian IT and Services industry is scheduled to lose about 6.4 lakh low-skilled jobs to automation over the next five years. Ugh, not another robots are taking over our jobs story. Although all the jobs at risk are at the bottom of the pyramid, this is alarming since the $160 billion IT industry is one of India’s biggest employers. We already have an R3, won’t be long before we get an R2-D2 as well. 
  

* Air India is certainly not a private sector airliner. But a lot of bureaucrats treat Air India like their own private airliner. Part of that is because they’re mandated by law to travel by Air India. That might be changing soon. In a potential policy change, bureaucrats may be [allowed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-may-lose-privilege-of-being-sole-carrier-of-government-staff-if-cabinet-note-goes-through/articleshow/53144940.cms) to choose the airline that offers the lowest fare rather than having to travel on Air India. So, Air India may lose the privilege of being sole carrier of government babus. Although, was it really a privilege before this? 
  
* You know how the bad guys in every movie always carry black suitcases full of cash to a drug deal? How much cash do you reckon is inside those suitcases? Well, if the government gets to decide, no more than ₹3 lakh. The government is considering a ban on cash [transactions](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ban-cash-transactions-of-above-rs-3-lakh-to-curb-black-money-top-court-told-1431507) of more than ₹3 lakh. Another measure under consideration seeks to ban holding more than ₹15 lakh in cash at any time.

There has to be a level headed answer. I do not agree with tumblr moral relativism but I also do not agree with the neo Nazis that seek only to demonize Indians.
So I want to make a repository of social justice issues afflicting India and a ready reference for what Indians are doing to fix this.

First of all we need to address the problems in India before we can begin. I will start by listing some of the issues that tend to get posted all over reddit, and see if the community here can help to point to steps taken by the government, society or Indians to change things for the better.

**Pip Pip, Guv’nah!**

It’s here, and it’s real. The referendum to decide Britain’s fate took place last week, and a lot of things have hit the fan since then. It’s time for the Brits to wake up and smell the tea. With a 52% share of the vote, the Brexit camp won, which means the UK will now [leave](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/17/11963668/brexit-uk-eu-explained) the EU. It won’t happen next week, or next month - they now need to go through a complex procedure that can potentially take about 2 years to complete before officially becoming EU-free. They need to negotiate the terms of the exit with the EU as well as sort out some internal affairs that had been managed by the EU until now. The EU which accounts for 1/4th of global economy is also India’s single largest export market. To ELI5 the effect this will have on India - previously, Indian companies had to satisfy only one rule in order to sell products everywhere in Europe. But now, they will have to satisfy one rule in order to sell products in the UK, and another rule in order to sell products everywhere else in Europe. Nevertheless, the headline news here is that most of UK just went, “Farewell, European Union!”. Or more accurately, as the Brits would say, “Cheerio, buggers!”. 



**You Get To Exit, And You Get To Exit, Everybody Gets to Exit**

There are exits and then there are exits. But it all started with the Rexit (Rajan exiting the RBI). Now coincidentally, we’ve got an exodus of people in business and economics leaving their positions. YC Deveshwar, who’s been for 20 years the head of ITC, the billion dollar cigarettes-to-hotels firm is [leaving](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/uhmto3w6LYTfdGcXfcdjLN/Deveshwar-to-lead-ITC-as-nonexecutive-chairman-after-term-e.html) next year. SK Roy, the head of LIC, the state-run insurance company that is the single biggest domestic investor in the markets today just [tendered](http://www.firstpost.com/business/lic-chairman-s-k-roy-another-upa-appointee-resigns-before-his-5-year-term-2851360.html) his resignation as well. Roy was appointed for a 5-year term under the Manmohan Singh government. His term still has 2 years remaining but he’s calling it quits now. Can you guess the name of someone else who was also appointed under the Singh government and who also recently surprised everyone by the news of his exit? Alright, alright.. I’m sorry, I’ll move on. And now for some international resignations. Nikesh Arora, celebrity investor and ex-Google exec who was being groomed to be the next CEO of SoftBank also [resigned](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-can-t-be-ceo-in-waiting-softbank-s-nikesh-arora-explains-sudden-resignation-2226223) after they told him that founder and current CEO, Masayoshi wanted to be CEO for 5-10 more years. Kids these days, I tell you, so impatient. 48-year-old Nikesh Arora is currently busy coming to terms with the fact that he just left behind a pay package of $73 million a year.

**A ménage à trois**

A merger is when two or more companies come together to become one. Usually, mergers that are in the news refer to just two companies coming together. The *or more* part is rarely invoked. But this time, we have a rare case of merger with HDFC Life, Max Life Insurance and Max Financial Services [going](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/MJ5YsT8RS330FJhTDYJJZM/Boards-of-HDFC-Standard-Life-Max-Financial-to-meet-to-discu.html) for a threesome of mergers. Here’s how it’ll work: Max Life Insurance, the fourth-largest private insurer, will merge with parent company, Max Financial Services which will then merge with HDFC Life, the third-largest private insurer. Together, they will combine to become India’s largest private insurer. Every merger has a story behind it, albeit not always an exciting one, it’s still business and not Dan Brown. But our story begins 13.8 billion years ago with the big bang. We had some dinosaurs. Then some other stuff happened. And then in the late 1990s, India allowed private insurance companies to compete in the market which was dominated by the state-run Life Insurance Corporation. It should’ve spelled bad news for LIC but it still emerged as the winner in the competition as even today, the insurance industry is dominated by LIC. It’s no joke to compete against LIC which sells insurance policies that are basically guaranteed by the government. So you need to join forces and make allies if you want to take on the ring-leader that is LIC. And this three-way merger is only an effort to join forces and make allies.

**Funding For A Fund Of Funds That Funds Startups**

A significant part of this series always ends up being about the government even though it is supposed to be about the economy. Well, that’s because a significant part of our economy is controlled by the government through state-owned corporations and legislative policies. But the government’s influence on the economy is gradually declining because of policies like disinvestment, where the government gradually privatizes state-owned corporations. But sometimes, you just have to invest to spur growth. The government [approved](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/establishment-of-fund-of-funds-for-funding-support-to-start-ups-116062200723_1.html) a ₹10,000 crore fund that will be managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India, who will use the money to invest in funds that invest in startups. With this, the government isn’t trying to encourage the creation of Indian Zuckerbergs and Gates’ - it’s trying to encourage the creation of Indian jobs (with the lowercase j). More specifically, the fund is expected to create 18 lakh jobs. 18 lakh jobs? That’s enough to feed 18 lakh poor families. Either that, or about 18 #Urbanpoors.

* From purchasing an eraser to issuing a press release, the government’s bureaucracy machine is known for setting up panels and committees and sub-committees and commissions to oversee everything. But not for finding a replacement for Raghuram Rajan. Jesus Christ, are we still on him? Yes, we’re still on him. The Prime and Finance Ministers are expected to [handpick](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/pm-narendra-modi-and-fm-arun-jaitley-to-select-raghuram-rajans-successor-not-a-panel/articleshow/52842311.cms) the next governor of RBI, and the news has it that they’re looking for a person with a background in economics rather than policy.

* Get ready to feel gross in your wet sandals and tip toe your way to the bathroom as soon as you get home... the monsoon is [here](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/monsoon-finally-arrives-in-drought-hit-maharashtra-90-of-state-receiving-rains-met-dept/). After being late by a week, the rains have covered more than half of the country as regions previously hit by droughts have begun getting rainfall. For farmers, this means the need to plant summer crops and for investors, this means that at least we have something to counter Brexit’s effects.

* The Food Corporation of India is the government-owned company that runs and manages the public distribution system, or what you might know as the ration shops that sell food at cheap prices. It’s the FCI that pays the extra 10 bucks while buying, so that the farmer doesn’t get exploited by having to sell for cheap. Except instead of mangoes, it’s food-grains. The government provides a lot of subsidies through the corporation - so many subsidies that the FCI now owes ₹58,650 crore to others as pending subsidy payments. Which is why it is [inviting](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/fci-to-raise-rs-20000-crore-short-term-loan/articleshow/52885209.cms) bids from banks to raise a short term loan of ₹20,000 crore. Oh yeah, because when you’re a government-owned corporation, you don’t go to the banks when you need a loan. The banks come to you.

* After a political campaign that ended with the exit of the RBI Governor, MP Subramanian Swamy is the talk of the town. And now, he has [trained](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/subramanian-swamy-now-targets-cea-arvind-subramanian-after-raghuram-rajan-exit-2868336/) his guns on Chief Economic Advisor to the government, Arvind Subramanian. In a salvo of tweets, Swamy stated that Arvind should be fired immediately. For there can only be one Subramanium.

This comes as part of a project that aims to increase milk production and make it more profitable for the farmers of India. Feminism may not be working out for the women of India, but it’s really taking off for the cows of India.

**[Hacked in Translation](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/05/23/hacked-in-translation/)**

Thanks for the tip to: /u/pks016

The way various media players process subtitles files is insecure. The vulnerabilities are all over the place and can easily lead to compromise your whole system. Couple this with the fact that many subtitle collection websites serve subtitles over insecure http and also may have unaudited security of the website itself. Even otherwise, there's a big risk from the subtitle files included within the pirated videos that many choose to download. Many of the popular players (including Kodi and VLC) have released fixes for this. If you use another video player, make sure to check if it has an update out for this and install the same.

**[OneLogin suffers breach—customer data said to be exposed, decrypted](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/06/onelogin-data-breach-compromised-decrypted/)**

OneLogin is an identity management company whose systems are used by many other companies to maintain single-sign-on (SSO) systems. This attack leaves any company that uses OneLogin open to massive attacks and thus all such entities are now scrambling to invalidate and reset any credentials in use. As a user (if your company uses them), you can't do much except sit back and wait :(

Here's why India shouldn't adopt the Nordic welfare model,40,2gg76m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2gg76m/heres_why_india_shouldnt_adopt_the_nordic_welfare/,105,1410808354.0,"DECONSTRUCTION OF THE NORDIC MODEL

Most problems that India face now can be attributed to consequences of Nehruvian socialism that this country has adopted for about 45 years. I am from Kerala and here the Politics cannot be separated from communism and despite being an age old relic, it still refuses to die out.

Since the reforms that was carried out in 1991 most millennial Indians have largely rejected such archaic concepts focusing more on modernity. But in this context a new concept has largely caught the fancy of most new age Indians: The Nordic model. As such in my experience I see more people supporting Nordic model over communism currently in Kerala. 

In this slightly lengthy post, I will try to deconstruct the Nordic model from two angles.

1. Nordic viability in India
2. Efficacy of Nordic model

First a note on Nordic model. Nordic model or Nordic capitalism or Nordic social democracy refers to the economic and social models of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), which involves the combination of a free market economy with a welfare state. More or less implemented around the mid 60s, this is said to have promoted a sustainable state and economy in these countries. Calls have been made among policy makers in India, with special mention to Nobel prize winning welfare economist Amartya Sen, to implement reforms along the Nordic lines in India

NORDIC VIABILITY IN INDIA

Nordic Socialism: Indian proponents of Nordic model advocate establishing a state along the social democracy lines. But the truth is that Scandinavia isn't really all that socialist. Scandinavian countries have certain socialist characteristics such as high taxes and extensive welfare systems. However, these countries have relatively capitalistic markets. Scandinavian businesses are mostly free from regulation, nationalization and protectionism. Sweden, Denmark and Finland rank higher than US in in business freedom, monetary freedom, investment freedom, fiscal freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. Norway ranks higher than the US in trade freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. 

Source: http://www.heritage.org/index/explore

The overall point here is that Scandinavian countries have fairly capitalistic business environments. Until India, which has abysmal rankings in all these parameters, achieve free business environment and comparable income levels it should not consider a comparable welfare model.

 Economic calculation problem: First proposed by Ludwig von Mises, it describes the signalling function of prices. Prices of goods are signals to entrepreneurs to adequately allocate their resources. When economic planning is added to the mix, it distorts the market forces and prices. This in turn facilitates inefficient allocation of resources and wastage. In a macro scale this presents itself as inflation. Larger the economy, harder it becomes to ""plan"". Scandinavian nations are all small economies with homogeneous economic components and it would be relatively easier to centralize function there (But it has not been without its demerits, more on that below). India is one of the largest and the most diverse economy in the world in terms of the economic components involved. As such India is last candidate for any sort of planning. History has shown that most planning here has met with some sort of counterproductive unintended consequence and the inflation numbers here speaks for itself.

Bureaucracy and social trust: Scandinavian countries are characterized by high levels of social liberalism and trust. Research finds that high levels of social trust increase economic growth. According to one study, ""The size of the effect in most studies is such that 10 percentage points higher trust is associated with half a percentage point higher annual growth rate. In the Scandinavian countries, about 60 percent agree that most people can be trusted, which can be compared to the OECD average of about just 40 percent.

Source: http://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Govt-Size-and-Growth.pdf

There is also the case of the highly transparent nature of the bureaucracy in the Scandinavian nations. As with the trust worthy nature of the bureaucrats there, they can be trusted with governing functions of the state. Bureaucracy is India on the other hand is an absolute mess. India features almost at the bottom of the transparency index. As evidenced by the corruption, Bureaucrats here simply cannot be trusted with any action and would be best left free of bureaucratic control.

Source: http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2013/results/#myAnchor1

Taxation problem: Scandinavian nations are characterized by high levels of taxation on income. Although I will go into the problems of Nordic model below, it must be said that these countries grow in spite of high taxes, not because of them. Indeed, several studies which examine taxation across developed countries show that when other determinants of growth are accounted for, taxation seriously diminishes growth. At the same time it must be added that while these countries have high tax on incomes, the corporate levels are low. Corporate tax average of Scandinavian nations is about 25% compared to about 40% in USA. So it is possible that the corporate sector there is balancing the economy. Hence higher tax levels are not an option in India where industry and corporate sectors constitute only a marginal share of the overall economy.

Sources: http://ideas.repec.org/p/hhs/ratioi/0130.html
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1699715

Economic history of Nordic nations: Most Scandianavian nations instituted the Nordic model in mid 1960s. Before this most of these countries reaped benefit from high growth facilitated by laissez faire policies and neutrality in the World Wars. Welfare system that you see now wouldn't have been possible had it not been for the surplus it had made during their laissez faire era. India on the other hand has no Laissez faire history. It is a country which is home to half of the world's poor. By instituting a welfare state, India would be incentivizing these poor souls to continue in their misery.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/9YhKdaE.png

Norway : Norway is an exception among Nordic nations itself. Oil was discovered in the North Sea in 1960 after which the country made its switch to welfare state. When liberals in US point to the per-capita GDP of Norway, they forget to mention that much of this is a result of big oil interests. Norway is the largest oil producer and exporter in all of Western Europe. Norway produces roughly 200 barrels of oil per person per year. That puts it at number 5 in the world for per capita oil production. In other words, Norway is successful despite its government, not because of its government. India is largely import dependent when it comes to oil and has very few proven oil reserves. It cannot bank on resource wealth to fund its welfare state.

EFFICACY OF THE NORDIC MODEL

In this portion, I will discuss the problems with Nordic model itself. Given below are series of comparisons he made between Scandinavian nations and USA under various parameters. While US itself is no paragon of capitalism. Over the years it has show relatively high levels of free markets which has slightly regressed in the recent years. The main difference between the American system and the Nordic Model is that America has a medium-size welfare state and the Nordic nations have large welfare states. That explains, at least in part, why the U.S. economy generally outperforms the Nordic Model. US stats were easily available online, so I took that. Give me a beak.

As seen in Figure below US has enjoyed a faster rate of growth.According to the OECD, the U.S. grew by an average of 3 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 3.3 percent between 1992 and 2006 (meaning average growth of 3.2 percent for 1981 to 2006). The Nordic nations, by contrast, grew by an average of 2.2 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 2.7 percent from 1992 to 2006(meaning average growth of 2.5 percent over the entire period). The IMF, meanwhile, reports that U.S. growth averaged 3.1 percent from 1981–2006 compared to an average of 2.6 percent for Nordic nations in the same period.

Figure below, measures of per capita GDP from the World Bank, the OECD, the IMF, and the CIA all show that Americans haveabout $6,000 of additional economic output per person, significantly more than $20,000 for each family of four.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/ilG5UVr.png

Although per capita GDP is an excellent measure of overall economic output relative to population, it does not necessarily measure living standards. Comparing U.S. and Nordic living standards requires numbers for disposable income. The OECD series for disposable income in the Figure below. According to a study using 2003 data, the average person in the US had more than $27,000 of disposable income, while the average person in Nordic nations Had disposable income of barely $14,300, less than 53 percentof the U.S. level. Even Norwegians, bolstered by oil wealth, had per capita disposable income of less than $16,800, barely 62 percent of the American level. Danes and Finns are at the bottom, with less than 50 percent of the disposable income of the average American. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/anuxd8j.png

Personal consumption: In 2005, the Danish Finance Ministry produced numbers comparing per capita private consumption in OECD nations. As seen in Figure below, the average person in Nordic nations has barely 51 percent as much private consumption as an average American. The Norwegians are the most prosperous, but even their private consumption is just 56 percent of U.S. levels. Both the Swedes and the Finns have less than 50 percent of the private consumption of average Americans. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/jIIqdoc.png

As expected by the nature of free markets Nordic countries lag US when it comes to per capita GDP growth

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gjBFuGG.png

Last but not least, defenders of the Nordic Model argue that the US suffers from greater levels of income inequality. Various measures of inequality, such as Gini coefficients, confirm that “wealthy” Americans earn a bigger share of the pie than Upperincome citizens in Nordic nations. But this data is incomplete without also looking at the size of the pie. As illustrated in Figure below, the poorest 10 percent of Americans have about the same level of income as the poorest 10 percent of Finns, Swedes, and Danes. Only in oil-rich Norway is there a noticeable gap (data for Iceland not available). What differentiates America from the Nordic nations is the income of everyone else. The rich, the middle class, and the working class in the US enjoy higher levels of income than their Nordic counterparts. If nations are being judged on the prosperity of their poorest citizens, then Nordic nations certainly are equal to the US. Indeed, they even have a slight advantage (though even that advantage might disappear if Nordic nations had US levels of immigration). But if nations are being judged on factors beyond just the well-being on the poorest segment of the population, then the US holds a clear edge.

CONCLUSION

Excessive government diminishes growth. And although the Nordic countries’ relatively free markets mitigate the damage caused by high taxes and high spending, the burden of government is hindering economic performance. The Nordic Model is preferable to the Continental or Corporatist Model of nations such as France and Germany, which combines welfare state policies and interventionism. When I was researching this , Google news showed that Sweden plans to scale back it welfare state due to pressure.

These AAP Kejriwal types are constantly backing a welfare state. I am not against AP or anything, if they can just fix their economic policies, I'll be all for them. Milton Friedman famously said that you cannot have a Welfare state and open borders. Sweden seems to learning that lesson. In India's case Free markets is the best option.

"Dear Kejriwal,",17,2wmiqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2wmiqn/dear_kejriwal/,112,1424521077.0,"Dear Kejriwal,
&nbsp;


Any state that functions on freebies in free market only kills itself. I wish we take a lesson from countries such as Argentina, which are run on subsidies, free healthcare and infrastructure. What has happened to countries and states like those : people have become inherently lazy, high unemployment, formalized labour is reduced to a few thousands (many people do not want to be legally working as they have to pay high taxes for benefits to people who do not want to work for it). Well, it is a choice a leader makes. You can a loved leader of today (because of the freebies) but you will be a joke of tomorrow as you would have brought down a healthy(economically) state with you. 
&nbsp;


It might relieve some people of paying electricity and water bills today however, the future the generation will suffer unemployment and lack of competitive resources thanks to policies you are perpetuating. 
&nbsp;


Aam Aadmi Party was supposed to be a party with a difference, but even AAP has decided to play politics. In the short sightedness of increasing a vote bank the party is going to kill the economy of the state. People are not fools to not see through this.
&nbsp;


Instead of free water, free electricity, free roads, free security shouldn't you/ AAP be concentrating to empowering people to pay for those facilities rather than making them beggars(people getting services for free). How to empower people is by creating jobs. Jobs given on the basis of merit not caste/senoirity/political agenda.
&nbsp;


Like I said, it is a choice a leader makes. To be loved today and hated in the future.
It is your choice Arvind Kejriwal.
&nbsp;


Please, for the sake of the people of Delhi may God bless you with some brains and decision making abilities.

The identity crisis of Middle India,3,7gdjxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7gdjxr/the_identity_crisis_of_middle_india/,0,1511993806.0,"It is often said of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, that he was the last Englishman to rule India. The saying carries some element of truth to it. Nehru may have been born in Allahabad, but his heart lay in the Shires and Oxbridge. This showed through in his language, cultural sensibilities, and overall, the parliamentary democracy that he guided us towards. He was a towering intellect, but unlike his contemporaries who were by and large bilingual intellectuals, his writings were mainly in English. He could give a speech in Hindi, but his knowledge of the tongue ended there. His sensibilities were English and it is to his credit that being so English and upper class as he was, he could mingle with just about anyone from the classes or the masses in a country as diverse as India.

One of Nehru’s primary concerns at Independence was the building of a national identity. India, under the British, was a loose confederation of states that recognized the paramountcy of the British and its people subscribed to only a vague sense of ‘Indian-ness’ that was never formally defined. Nor was such a definition even required. The Tamil in the far south was as unconcerned with the Punjabi in the far north, as was the Bengali with the Gujarati. As far as the common man was concerned, they mainly subscribed to more or less the same set of cultural values. There really was no concept of a political union called India. Indeed, the idea of a country called India, was born with independence and the dissolution of the British raj. However, the dissolution of the British Raj also brought with it partition and all its communal horrors. The lack of a common identity between the Hindu and the Muslim tore once harmonious communities apart. Nehru and his contemporaries realized that the fabric that held this nation together was frayed at the edges and would soon tear apart. It was of utmost importance, therefore, to cultivate a common identity of Indian-ness, and suppress any alternate cultural or regional identity.

We have all been part of this identity formation, whether it took the form of singing the national anthem every morning at school, or by learning the names of various and far flung rivers of the nation. And by and large, we have succeeded. A Tamilian today cheers for “Enga thalai Dhoni”, a man from Ranchi, Jharkhand with as much fervor as the Punjabi, the Bengali or the Gujarati. A common identity has been built and there is little talk of separatism in the Indian heartland. What separatism exists has literally been pushed to the fringes of the nation and is on the verge of fizzling out itself. The political unification of India has been a success.

Culturally though, we remain as diverse as ever, and a unified identity is something that is neither attainable nor desirable. In many areas of India, language remains a prickly subject and it is quite common to hear diatribes against linguistic minorities and those who do not speak the language native to the area they stay in. However, even this problem of communication has been resolved by that great gift of Empire, the English language. If two people from any of the country’s opposite extremes were to converse, they would use the English language to great effect. Indeed, this has even resulted in an amalgamated language called ‘Inglish’ which has created a cultural identity and linguistic space of its own.

Socially too, we are as diverse and it must be said, as divided as ever. Perhaps more so in the present than at any time in the past, near or ancient. India has always had a divided society. The caste system effectively divides us into haves and have-nots, where the have-nots outnumber the haves by a large sum. The have-nots, by virtue of their numbers are at the bottom of the pyramid, and the haves are right on top. This caste based division of society is often reflected in the economic sphere as well. The upper castes are in most cases, very well off. The lower castes tend to be among the poorer and more downtrodden sections of the society. Consequently the aspirations of the haves are vastly different from the aspirations of those at the lower half of the pyramid. This social pyramid has been the template for every society since the beginning of time. The upper classes, the middle classes and the lower classes are at various times dominant separately, but their composition remains pretty much the same. When the aspirations of one of these classes are not met, a society will experience upheaval. In the case of the lower classes, it is revolution. For the others, this upheaval takes the form of a flight to greener pastures. It is this upheaval that India is facing today.

The Indian state in the past sixty years has done a decent, though by no means complete, job of providing for the basic (and here I must stress on the word basic) aspirations of the lower rungs of the pyramid. The Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has been taken care of for many Indians. Food security was achieved quite a while ago, while our housing situation too has not been too bad. Again, I must remind the reader that there is much to be done, but there has been a good deal of coverage in this area. In the case of the better off citizen of this nation, the Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has always been taken care of. It is something else that he aspires too. These aspirations may take the form of entertainment, social standing, a certain lifestyle or even the choice of clothing. It is a matter of debate as to whether these aspirations have been fulfilled or not. Certainly, the cities of India hold all the ingredients to provide for these aspirations. And yet, it is seen that they do not and the urban youth have flocked to greener pastures abroad like migratory wildebeest. The logical conclusion in this case is that the aspirations of the urban youth have changed and these aspirations are something that Indian society cannot fulfill.

And so what are the aspirations of the urban, educated, elite of this nation? Certainly education and employment is readily available. Admission into an IIT/NIT, or barring that, an educational institute of similar standing is within their reach. A degree in Engineering guarantees every one of them gainful employment with a salary that can ensure a comfortable lifestyle. Some of them go in for a post graduate degree or diploma in management or business administration. A resume containing all this can lead to a very comfortable lifestyle with excellent prospects for any young Indian with an eye on his future. And yet, it is not sufficient to ensure that he or she does not take flight to greener pastures? What then, are the greener pastures that they aspire to?

Everyone has heard of the brain drain of the 70’s and 80’s. Educated Indians fled abroad in huge numbers, stymied by the lack of opportunities in this land. It was a great loss yes, but one could understand why they left. India in those days was in a socialist paroxysm. The license-quota-permit Raj that Nehru set up stifled creativity and business enterprise. Jobs were hard to come by in an economy with a ‘Hindu-rate-of-growth’ and as a result doctors, engineers and scientists fled this country for the US, helping to build societies there. Today however, the nation is better poised to provide employment and opportunities to its engineers and doctors. And yet, they continue to leave in droves. What then, are the opportunities that they are looking for?

Nehru tried hard to build a common identity for this nation. Today, nearly fifty years after his death, it is hard to say if he has succeeded or not. There is a political and cultural union called India. There is also a growing population of youth that hardly even identifies itself with this nation and its people and culture anymore. They identify themselves with the West. And it is in search of this identity, that they surge westwards in increasing numbers every year.

When I asked why they wished to leave this nation, I received many replies.. Some are insightful, some well thought out, and some are purely cynical and selfish, though unbeknownst to the person concerned.

One worshipper of the Western way of rational thought spoke in raptures about their technological and industrial prowess and glowingly described their plans to build a magnetically levitated high speed rail system. He noted that his own nation that had fed, housed and educated him for twenty five years was a “backward shithole that did not invent anything of note”, thus conveniently discarding the fact that it took the United States a hundred years to reach where it is now, while India is still suffering from its birth pangs.

A young lady of my acquaintance described India as a selfish, repressed society of bullies who could not be counted upon to elect a capable Prime Minister. She was “sick of the way we use age old methods that cannot be integrated into modern society, Must it be taught to even respect equally?”. She was right, to an extent. But it is doubtful if she would ever find a society that respects equally, where bullying is not tolerated and is not parochial and narrow minded in some sense. It also took all of my self control to keep from reminding her that Donald Trump has been elected to the most powerful office in the world.

The real reason, one that they are loathe to acknowledge, is that they no longer identify with the people around them anymore. Indeed, the vast majority of Indians are invisible to them and when they do make an appearance in their lives, they are disgusted and feel alienated. They would rather not acknowledge the presence of those whose aspirations are to merely survive, than to sit in a bar the whole day and drink beer and discuss the latest happenings in International politics. Fed on a relentless diet of Americana, they do not identify with Indian events, Indian characters, Indian food, drink or even other Indians anymore. The television shows they watch are American. The food that they eat is American. The books they read are American. The language they are most comfortable with is American. The news channels they are most familiar with show local American news. Indeed, they would know more about the political system of the USA than of their own nation. The latest agendas of the latest Senatorial candidates would be on their fingertips. What would not be on their minds, is the names of their MP’s and MLA’s back home.

One of the most absurd things I have heard of in recent times is the news that a socialist has been elected to the Seattle city council. That a socialist has been elected in the USA itself is absurd enough. But what makes the news even more absurd is the fact that the candidate who campaigned on a socialist platform was an Indian who was raised in India, was educated in India, was in all likelihood a beneficiary of all the post liberalization reforms of the Government of India. Like everyone else in her generation, she would have been the first to demand reforms and the lifting of India’s socialist policies and yet, when she emigrated to the US, rediscovered the socialist in herself, because she could not bear to see the suffering of the American masses under the yoke of capitalism. It reeks of hypocrisy. Would she do the same thing in India? No. In India, the very same candidate would have triumphantly pointed to the benefits of our liberalization and campaigned for a right wing party, merely because the reforms have benefitted her tiny group of elites who reside on the top of the pyramid at the expense of those at the bottom. But of course, they do not even exist for her. Instead, she chose to fight for the American’s Roti, Kapada, aur Makaan, because – “ It is easier to convince 300 million literate people to vote for you, than to convince 1 billion illiterate people, never mind that they are your own people.”. There is a word to describe such people. It is ‘mercenary’. But then, what can you expect of a people who would rather celebrate Halloween to Holi?

It is easier to convince three hundred million literates to vote for you. It is far more difficult for these people to convince the one billion Indians who are their countrymen to vote for them because they do not even speak their language. Indeed, they do not even make an effort to learn their own mothertongue and identify with the rest of their society. This laziness to push themselves and achieve something points to a deeper malaise in our psyche. In other words, this generation of Indians has ‘Aspirations, but no Ambitions’. They feel apart from the world around them and would rather run away to the West than do anything about the very society that gave birth to them, but cannot satisfy their outsize American aspirations. And why would they not? They are Americans in all but name.

**TL;DR - Our urban youth emigrate because they are culturally American and do not even identify themselves as Indian anymore.**

In the Maharashtra assembly elections, MIM won two seats. Think about it. An openly communal muslim party, which till now was limited to hyderabad and its surroundings, has entered MH. It is extremely likely that they might become a sizeable player in states like UP by the next elections there. Why has this happened? What caused muslims, who till now were Congres voters, to vote for an openly Muslim communal party? Why this insecurity? Is it because of the statements by BJP leaders?

The goons of VHP and Bajrang Dal that used to beat up young boys and girls for sitting tohether in a park on Valentine's day, have been given important positions in the party and the government. These people are now policy makers. Who knows what they might do someday? Maybe they'll introduce a law that makes intereligous marriages illegal?

This is not what I voted for. I voted for a better, stronger India. If Modi is unable to check these radical elements, i am afraid I might have to vote for AAP or, god forbid, Congress in the next elections.

Gujarat also has [Swagat](http://swagat.gujarat.gov.in/), the Chief Minister's Online Grievance Redressal System since long time back. You can also contact any state department for any other purpose [online](http://www.gujaratindia.com/interactive/interact-with-gov.htm). With Aapnu Taluko Vibrant Taluko (ATVT), every taluka can prepare its own development plan (much like Kejriwal's idea of constituency-specific issues excet that this has been in-place before AAP was born).

* **Surprise visits:** Modi has been doing these since he became CM ([example](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-11-26/ahmedabad/28062116_1_narendra-modi-surprise-visits-gunotsav)). But the national media is more obsessed with talking about why his blog post concerning the riots is not genuine.

* **VAT simplification:** This is on every newspaper's front page. Good to see that the traders of Delhi can now have something that the traders of Gujarat [have since 2011](http://www.caclubindia.com/share_files/new-vat-registration-simplified-in-gujarat-43789.asp#.UsTnhLSIrIU). It's so funny to see #ApingAAP trending on Twitter when Gujarat has done all these things before AAP.

* **Water:** Unlike other states of India (except probably Rajasthan), Gujarat is a drought-prone state - 70% of its fresh water resources are located in 30% of its area. In 2012, the state received only 72% of the average annual rainfall (some areas like Saurashtra received only 56%). Despite all this, Gujarat is now a water-surplus state. The Government created a water supply grid, which now supplies 1340 million liters of water to Saurashtra and Kutch. The annual use of water tankers has reduced from 5000 to 500. According to the Central government norms, each village should get 50 litre per capita per day (LPCD) of water, while each city should get 140 LPCD. For Gujarat, these figures are 100 LPCD and 150 LPCD respectively. 76% of the houses have tap-water connections (All-India average: 34%). The river inter-linking idea of [Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2u9eh5EMSo) is being [implemented in Gujarat.](http://guj-nwrws.gujarat.gov.in/showpage.aspx?contentid=1471&lang=English)

* **Electricity:** AAP had promised that it would fight corruption in the discoms to reduce electricity prices, but it reduced the tariffs through subsidy. In stark contrast, Modi scrapped the [25% relief](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2003-02-26/news/27545602_1_power-subsidy-torrent-group-domestic-consumers) offered to domestic consumers. Only the [BPL families](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-04-16/news/38586381_1_tariff-hike-gerc-gujarat-electricity-regulatory-commission) are granted relief from the tarrif hikes, unlike Kejriwal's freebies which are available even to the upper class. Plus, the farmers are offered subsidy in a bid to increase the agricultural output. Apart from the massive solar power infrastructure and the new Wind Energy Policy, Modi cleared the Mithivirdi nuclear power plant despite protests from 'activists' who do not understand that nuclear energy is clean and the new-generation reactors are safe. Kejriwal and Bhushan on the other hand have joined the misguided leftists to oppose the Kudankulam plant.

* **Aam Aadmi:** Kejriwal was born in an elite family (his father is an engineering graduate from BITS Pilani - a big thing in the 1960s). Modi is the son of a chaiwala, and himself sold tea on railway platforms in his childhood. He doesn't talk about his Sudra caste, though it is the fastest way to attract a large number of OBC votes. He follows a [simple lifestyle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri9aac_Ds-g). But media has managed to project him as a person obsessed with extravagant lifestyle by focusing on his hobby of collecting designer fountain pens or his elaborate security (which he needs given that he is #1 on the list of terrorists).

Of course, there are other well-known points such per capita income increase (Rs.19,823 in 2001 to Rs. 75,115 in 2011), revenue deficit in 2001 to revenue surplus now, One Day Governance (covers 173 public services), 108 Emergency services, BRTS, reduction in school dropout rate (just 2% now) etc. But our great media focuses only on the negatives. A good example - Gujarat was among the most malnourished states in India before Modi - the malnutrition rate dropped from 70.69% to 38.77% - the [fastest and the largest imrpovement in entire India](http://www.firstpost.com/economy/guess-which-state-improved-most-in-malnutrition-gujarat-650087.html). How did our media report this achievement? They didn't. Instead we had these headlines:

* When will Modi address malnutrition in Gujarat?
* ‘Gujarat malnutrition rate worse than Somalia’
* Every third child in Gujarat is underweight, says CAG

At the time of Gujarat elections, the main issue discussed on TV channels was ""Have Muslims forgiven Modi yet?"" The media did not focus on Gujarat's 2012 manifesto, which includes highly discussable points such as

* teaching of foreign languages (Chinese and Japanese) in schools

* ultra-low-cost generic drugs and diagnostic services and health cards for farming animals

* 50 lakh low-cost pucca houses in next 5 years including 7.5 lakh 2-room houses for slum-dwellers costing Rs. 50,000 each (so far 22 lakh low-cost houses have been built since 2002)
* filling of Saurashstra dams with excess Narmada water ([SAUNI yojana](http://guj-nwrws.gujarat.gov.in/showpage.aspx?contentid=4720&lang=English)),
* further replacement of gas cylinders with piped cooking gas (Gujarat already provides piped cooking gas to 350 villages and some cities, which saves Rs. 600 crore of subsidy money)
* Rooftop solar power scheme
* Action plan for climate change
* Focus on making Gandhinagar a solar-energy driven city and a carbon neutral city.
* Wifi facilities at public places
* New portal for job placements to help young people find a job
* Promotion of marine biotechnology especially seaweed cultivation

The media doesn't want to talk about positive points and ideas in Modi's words - instead they are hell bent on cherry-picking to paint Modi's image as someone who does nothing except making personal attacks against the Gandhi family.",5
Truth about Delhi power subsidy,77,2vmwla,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2vmwla/truth_about_delhi_power_subsidy/,35,1423760331.0,"Before AAP came to power for the first time in Delhi, the fiscal deficit as a percentage of Gross State Domestic Product was 0.7%, which is the lowest of any other state. 
Per this article :
http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-12-24/news/45540181_1_aam-aadmi-party-fiscal-deficit-aap
>According to Reserve Bank of India ( RBI) data, Delhi was budgeted to have a fiscal deficit of 0.7% of gross state domestic product, well below the national average of 2.1%


The total Delhi budget is approximately ₹40,000 per year. 


This time AAP has said it will allocate ₹1600 crore for power subsidy for one year, which will go to benefit low income households using less than 400 units a month. This means 4% of the budget will go to subsidize power bills. 

Per : http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-elections-2015/top-stories/AAPs-poll-pledge-to-halve-Delhi-power-bills-may-cost-Rs-1600-crore-a-year/articleshow/46206413.cms


During Kejriwal's 49 day tenure, he allocated a total of ₹260 crore for power subsidy. 

Source : http://wap.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/delhi-budget-gives-power-subsidy-114071801293_1.html

It says :
>A day after the power regulator announced a rise in rates for Delhi customers, the government’s budget for 2014-15 announced a subsidy of Rs 260 crore, for low-end consumers.

>This will cut the rates for those consuming up to 400 units a month. Even then, the government will have a fiscal surplus of Rs 2,000 crore for the current financial year, compared to a deficit of Rs 2,900 crore in 2012-13.


The important thing to note from the above aeticle is that **""The Budget estimated a fiscal surplus of Rs 2,015 crore in 2014-15, against a deficit at Rs 2,924 crore in the revised estimate (RE) of the previous year.""**


So why is there a co-ordinated campaign to project that this subsidy has a harmful effect on the Delhi budget? It doesn't make a dent on the budget.

Also, It has been widely reported that the BSES YAMUNA, Reliance owned discom is not Cooperating with the CAG audit that was ordered by the AAP government.

**1. There is nothing to loose.**

Indian army [cannot loose against Pakistan](http://www.debate.org/opinions/can-pakistan-beat-india-in-a-war). Modi has alienated most of the neighbouring countries from Pakistan. [Afghanistan](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Ashraf+Ghani&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=aTLgV-77GIXYvATi6I_4BA#q=Ashraf+Ghani&tbm=nws), [Bangladesh](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=can+indian+army+loose+against+pakistan&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=nTHgV5TxMYbmvgShqoWoAg#tbm=nws&q=bangladesh+pakistan+terror)^[1](https://twitter.com/CNNnews18/status/777837701944909824) have outright condemned Pakistan.

All the conditions are there.

Secondly, the [Indian forces are superior to Pakistan's](http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&country1=india&country2=pakistan&Submit=COMPARE). India has an advantage in all three forces.

Secondly, it is just the continuation of Mr. He who must not be named policy in Gujarat, the Gujrat model of development, on a pan Indian scale. Sorry, no sources here.

And most importantly, Modi can look towards a resolution to Kashmir, in favorable terms. This he will make sure if India has the upper hand before truce.

A possible reason why India is yet to achieve optimum growth.,20,5bsjf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5bsjf0/a_possible_reason_why_india_is_yet_to_achieve/,5,1478630765.0,"Any stable form of government distributes its wealth and/or favors to the group that best helps its leader to remain in power. Dictators favor their generals over the local population while democracies try to favor their largest vote banks. In rich democracies, the largest vote group (middle class) contributes the most to the economy and pays the largest taxes. Here the government has a high incentive to favor the middle class with better amenities as a productive middle class generates more money and hence more tax wealth for the government. Hence trade and societal rules favoring the middle class is naturally prioritized.

But India has a unique problem. Our wealth generators and vote banks don’t overlap. Our rich middle class and above contribute to 80 % of our wealth. But 80% of our vote banks belong to the poor. For a politician to succeed in India he/she must make decisions that favor the poor. Hence trade regulations will be tighter, new industries will have a hard time setting up shop and any big franchises that threaten to push out small scale industries will face a lot of harassment. Societal issues like reservations are also made to favor large vote banks. It makes a lot more sense to replace caste based reservation with economic scholarships for the poor, but that won’t be accepted by the voting majority. 

Hence we are left in a situation where the government policies aren’t exactly economically friendly. And any politician who would try to change that won’t be well received by the public. A clever politician hence tries his best to favor the voting majority while loosening the economic notch just enough to allow some breathing space.",5

Roughly 3 bn dollars (in 2007 values) flowed into the country from abroad. Where the heck is this money disappearing? Into the ether?

Mind you these are the figures for the registered bodies and the declared funds.

[According to this report](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/ngos-get-rs-10-000-cr-annually-from-abroad-report-112031200090_1.html), the states with the highest inflow of foreign funds were TN and AP. Not a surprise that both these states have the highest conversion rates in the country (Religious, Christian conversion).

The single highest inflow into one organisation was World Vision which received a whopping 210 CRORES!!! 210 crores for what? [World vision](https://www.worldvision.in/About_Us) claims to be this philanthropic NGO, but they run TV channels and are heavily, heavily into conversions (mostly illegal, money funded) in TN & AP.

Look at the foreign donors? 

* Number 1? [Gospel for Asia Inc, USA](http://www.gfa.org/). Their home page has this Indian dude with the label of ""Sponsor a Missionary"" and has this as their mission statement,

>You can help us train, equip and send out laborers to share the Good News of Jesus Christ with lost men, women and children who have still not heard His precious name. Your partnership will impact the spiritual and physical well-being of those in desperate need as we love in word and deed.

I did some more Googling on the founder K.P Yohannan and [his brother was arrested in Kerala for possessing Rs 4,515 CRORES in unaccounted for money](http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Yohannans-brother-arrested/2013/08/19/article1741349.ece). Yohannan himself is under the scanner for having unaccounted assets worth Rs 1000 crores under the name of his various ""charities"".


THAT IS close to Rs 6,000 crores ($ 1 bn) of unaccounted money raised by ONE CHARITY! This shit is absolutely scary from a national security perspective. That money could be used for anything. Funding an armed miltia, jacking up the price of real estate, play the stock market...fuck knows what else it can be used for.

* The second highest donor? [Fundacion Vicente Ferrer, Barcelona, Spain](http://www.google.co.in/url?url=http://www.fundacionvicenteferrer.org/en/&rct=j&frm=1&q=&esrc=s&sa=U&ei=fimYU-GiA4vhywOj14GwCw&ved=0CBkQFjAB&usg=AFQjCNGF2soH811wQpYG1mOC3OA3DTBFbQ) is this a hard core NGO tasked to help the poor Indian? Nope. It is yet another conversion factory centred around AP. It is a Catholic Jesuit org centred around...conversions.

* The Number 3 top donor? World Vision. Have already spoken about them. [This expose](http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main.asp?filename=ts013004shashi.asp&id=1) by Tehelka (Secular magazine I suppose, not the Organiser) talks about how closely World Vision is tied into [The Joshua Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Project) and is entirely about conversions.

So tell me, in a country like India which is so poor, if an NGO is actually helping bring education, training, material comfort, food etc it is comendable, but so much money for conversion? Is it even morally right to prey on the poor just for the sake of a ""few souls""?

Indices & Lies,20,6b9037,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6b9037/indices_lies/,1,1494861954.0,"We have several indices to measure the economy. It is a set of indices that can give us a clear picture as to how economy is doing. Economy being a complex beast needs many indices to measure it. However, the indices are also not fixed and they are changed from time to time, particularly by changing the base year, or by recalibrating the main components of the indices. The base year gives the relative measure of the economics. It is like one thing is looked at from different points in space and points in time. Recently, two indices Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (WPI) are changed. The base year is revised and adjustment is done to accommodate ""structural changes"" in the economy. Structural changes is a subjective term at least in Indian economic scenario. The government may have to qualify what they mean by the structural change in the economy. The magic of changing the indices can make poverty disappear by a large number and it may make inflation look like deflation. This exactly happened to the inflation, due to change in the indices, the inflation fell down by many points. The change in the indices does not change the day to day reality of the Indian economic life. The common citizens know how difficult is to survive in the skyrocketing prices of essential commodities. The Government is blessed with the global oil prices, but it has not given any dividends of the major gain due to falling prices of oil. India could have gained much from this, but it seems that the RSS/BJP Government is keen on ""structural"" change in the economy. We know for sure that RSS/BJP Government is on ""statistical"" change.

All said and done, no economic index can capture the reality faced by the citizens on day to day basis. Recent article in the Economist reflects very sorry state of affairs in Indian economy, particularly how the aggregate spending of the States is exceeding the Union Government. The states are running into the deeper ruts of indebtedness, but they do not have to worry as the Union Government is the backing the loans raised by the Government bonds. The Government bonds are rated just above the junk bonds with a credit rating:BBB. This means that at some point of time Indian economy will enter into a downward spiral of slow down. The mounting debts will leads to a bigger catastrophe. The fiscal deficit of the states is larger than the union government, but the RBI is denying it. But given the mix of politics and economics in India at this stage, the Government will try to appease various constituencies by extending the dole outs. Fiscal prudence is more than needed in this country.

India is a federal country and the fiscal federalism is important system to keep the country afloat. Therefore, the state and union relations, particularly in the area of finance is important. Babasaheb Ambedkar worked in this area in his doctoral thesis ""Evolution of provincial finance in British India"": It is a landmark work relevant even today for its suggestions in how to distribute money between the centre and the states. This is an important area and the field is open to further studies as to how the GST (one uniform tax throughout India) will affect the centre and state relationship. With a single taxation policy, the intricate levy, collection, and distribution of the tax proceedings must be examined clearly and cleverly. Before, the Government tinkers the statistics further, the structural adjustment must be done and the areas waiting for the structural adjustment are key to India's development: enabling young India join the job market, free and easy access to education, and diversity in all areas.",5

***Complete text***

Dear Hon'ble Prime Minister,

Two weeks ago, I happened to visit Nepal for a vacation with my family. My son had his Durga Puja vacations and he wanted to go to the mountains. We were cautioned by many to avoid going to Nepal since there were reports that the transport system had come to a standstill. But after a cursory search online, we decided that it would not be a problem. I was also curious to see the situation on the ground. What I experienced on that trip is forcing me to write this letter to you.

You have yourself visited Nepal not long ago and must have gotten a sense of our shared history. At the moment, I am saddened to say that our long-standing good relations with the country are in peril. If you are getting reports from MEA officials that project a peaceful and happy situation there, I must tell you that it is not so. I have a strong suspicion that officials seem to have their own biases and interests in mind. I judge the situation based on what I have seen and after interacting with the most local of people. 

For instance, the waiter at the hotel in Pokhara where I was staying told me, “I don’t feel like serving Indians anymore. People from India come and misbehave all the time. They treat us like slaves and order us around. I would be happier if Nepal cut off all ties with India and our relations with China are strengthened. Their government and people are more considerate and friendly.” 
I would never underestimate the astute observations of the people on the ground. They probably understand foreign policy more than our officials.

I am also of the firm opinion that this “unofficial” act of India of clamping an embargo on petroleum products, medicines and food items, amongst others, is clearly an infringement of basic human rights. Nepal, a nation emerging from a devastating earthquake, deserved kid glove handling by India. Instead, we have, for reasons completely unknown, beaten them black and blue, whereby the populace today has turned totally anti Indian. The plight of the average Nepal citizen is comprehensible to anyone who has seen the unending queues for gasoline, the collapse of public transport, unavailability of medicines, closures of medical infrastructure and other such vital implications which have successfully enraged the people. Since Nepal is a land-locked country, it does not mean we will behave like big brother and choke supply of essential goods to get our way.

And what is 'our way'? Responsible and senior officials in your government, when I asked them about Nepal, expressed dismay and displeasure as to why that country dared to change fundamentals of their Constitution without discussing with India. I wonder if our MEA pundits can dare to speak in similar fashion, say, about Bangladesh or Burma. Not to speak of Pakistan or Sri Lanka. Should we be perceived as a bully by another, till yesterday friendly, sovereign nation is a question you have to ponder over.



India has been primarily responsible for dishing out a horrible Dasain to Nepal in 2015.
We have virtually forced a dark and obnoxious Deepawali on our Nepali sisters and brothers. At the behest of some unconcerned and arrogant MEA advisors/officials, India's relations with Nepal have become bitter for no rhyme or reason. 

The excuse of Madhesis opposing something that is exclusively and obviously internal for a free nation should not guide our short term policy that will damage India in the long term. We have to realize that, as with every Constitution in the world, it will be amended and changed over a period of time as and when the people will it. The Madhesis also have a say in the Nepal administration and they should be the ones to push for their rights, while India should be seen and felt as staying away and respecting the handling of the internal affairs of this sovereign nation and its democracy.

China has made the expected move of signing a MoU for short-term oil deal with Nepal. At the moment, Nepalese imports from India account for 60% of their total trade while those from China account for 13%. The Chinese are looking for an opportunity to tap this market and increase their share. The present animosity between Nepal and India will only bolster their attempts further. 

If you are under the impression that the Himalayas will prevent the Chinese from establishing a trade route to Nepal, think again.  They are capable of building multi lane highways in a matter of a few months in the most difficult of terrains. One such example of their determination and advanced techniques can be seen at the Sikkim border where they are extending their railway network while we struggle to maintain our rickety high altitude single lane roads.

My sincere suggestion to you would be to consider the situation in Nepal and tell our MEA to be patient and re-asses ground realities immediately. We need to give our neighbor time to evolve and mature, to sort out its issues democratically. India, which has been seen throughout history as being non-aligned and non-aggressive, should not take steps which would make the world think otherwise. We cannot, and should not, ruin our relationship with our neighbor by having a knee-jerk reaction to the social crisis unfolding there. Instead, we should offer support in the form of ensuring uninterrupted supply of essential goods and helping their economy come back on track. Urgency in this is of great importance. If we delay matters, the moment for India would be lost forever.

I hope you make history merely by ensuring that India stops interfering with Nepal’s internal affairs.

Tathagata Satpathy,

WTF is Demonetisation - Part III,6,5fxbub,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5fxbub/wtf_is_demonetisation_part_iii/,4,1480636947.0,"Final Part

There's lot of talks now about Cashless Economy. In TV debates the ones supporting BJP are showing their mobile phones and saying 'this is your money going forward'.

So far, in the last 2 parts, we've seen how black money is generated in cash economy. Global Financial Integrity (GFI) in its report on how much illegal money has been stashed in banks worldwide, says Politicians 3%, Drug money 33%, rest 64% are corporates and crony capitalists!

So the reason why they are forcing everyone to go into banks? We should look into it more seriously. This call for bringing everyone into the banking infrastructure is not the brainchild of Modi - this was floated during UPA rule - they said we'll open bank accounts for everyone and then credit your subsidies into your bank account.

There was considerable opposition to such a move and they couldn't get it passed. In 2014, Modi came into power and realized he couldn't pass it through the same way and cunningly said I'm going to abolish financial insecurity and enable even the poor to have a bank account. He enticed everyone by saying anyone who opens account will get Rs.5000 loan.

Then he says if you want subsidy, you can get it only if you have a bank account. Next it is going to be extended to PDS - ration cards as well. They say 23 Crore bank accounts have been opened. But reports have come out saying those are fraud - many created by bank officials themselves - it has been exposed as dead accounts and not used extensively.

They are giving newspaper ads saying 'you can buy even flowers & vegetables from roadside vendor lady using app on your phone' So please learn how to use this with detailed full page diagrams.

We all know PayTM gave full page ad with Modi's prominent picture. Why are people being pushed into using this? A lot many people are outside this credit / cahless economy and depend on cash economy, as we've seen in the previous post. So they are unable to give any other justification to bring them in - so they keep saying 'cashless will eradicate black money completely'. Some gullible people here believe it too!

But how will cashless remove corruption or black money? They explain, 'see if every transaction is made through cash, how will RTO demand cash?' They think they've stumped people questioning them. But you don't have to worry about how RTO will demand cash. They will improvise!

Just in these ~25 days, haven't we seen how the small fry with loads of cash improvised and got their illegal stash washed into pure white money - by various nefarious means?

Election Commission famously came out with strict measures to curb 'cash for votes' - but was it successful? The political parties went the route of 'token system' and duped the EC! Just the same way, new nefarious means will be devised by all these departments. 

The question about how RTO gets bribe is wrong. Where should it be monitored?  Adani wants these bribes - in the last post we saw how these Adani's & Ambani's need Ministers in those states to do their illegal business! 

So the corporate crony capitalists need these bribes to go on for the smooth functioning of their illegal businesses'. So the govt has to work for them. 

We saw up above how only 3% is of the politicians and 64% is of the crony capitalists. So if this 64% of black money needs to be safe and continue to grow, the 3% should be guaranteed by the crony capitalists. Now do you get the picture?

There is no greater foolishness than thinking once we swipe cards all illegal money will vanish into thin air. Why is there a need to bring all the money into the banking system? Arun Jaitlee explains 'My goal is to make majority people pay tax'. Are the majority of people not paying tax? We all pay hidden taxes. The new rule that tries to bring all taxation under one umbrella, the GST, has highest 28%. Above that they'll get education cess, swachh bharat cess etc etc. In addition the middle class people, pay direct tax (IT) so they pay 30-40%

How much do the business owners pay tax? The maximum they pay is 30% direct tax. It is one of the lowest direct taxation among all countries in the world. 

When you look at Privatisation of economy starting from 1994 until now, if we check who's taxation has been reduced and who's has been increased, we can see the common man's taxes have been systematically increased YOY. But in the same timeline the taxation of corporates and crony capitalists have been reduced.

In India we have had the time of 'Super Tax' - Very rich business owners / corporates had to pay 80% to 90% tax! But it has been reduced again and again and finally now max they pay is 30%.

The 2  reasons given for the tax reduction for corporates/crony capitalists:

- The justification that only if the corporates/crony capitalists are levied low taxes, they'll invest in India and thereby give jobs.

- Because you levy 60,70,80,90%, the corporates crony capitalists try to evade taxes. So the lesser the tax, the more willing they'll be to pay taxes!

According to reports from eminent economists, we can see that each year about 5 Lakh Crores has been reduced for these corporates, finally it has reached this 30%. So after such tax reduction shouldn't the black money be brought down? But contrarily, it has exponentially increased is what the reports say!

How do we see this tax reduction? When they say no we cant pay 70% or 80%, the govt said ok we'll make it 60% - now pay it please. So the govt has essentially said ok we'll not look at this part of your black money pay for the rest of it! So its not just tax reduction but acceptance of their black money by the govt!

Certain taxes have been completely abolished like capital gains tax, wealth tax etc. So when these crony capitalists say no we can't pay huge taxes, the govt has essentially fell at their feet saying ok we won't look at your other part if you pay 60%, 50%, 40% ..ok now only 30%

Even if the taxes are brought down to 0% they won't be satisfied! For eg Nokia made huge prfits much bigger than the capital they invested in Chennai, but when they were asked for 22,000 Crore as tax, they just shut shop and went home! This is the approach these corporates have towards paying taxes!

When ordinary people are asked, 'why do you pay tax', they say its because only then the govt will be able to lay roads, bring electricity, water, education, hospitality etc. This is their understanding. But are these things happening effectively? The answer is a big NO!

Why do the corporates pay taxes? So they get benefits like free electricity, roads, infrastructure, loans etc. This is not enough - govt has to protect their property and money and business. If there is any trouble from their employees etc, the govt has to provide protection for them.

In the last 20 years, many subsidies have been extended for these corporates. Free Land, Free electricity, free water, Free loans at reduced rates, establish markets for their goods products here and abroad. So they don't have to work - they are carried on the shoulders of the govt! 

At the same time for the common man, there are no decent govt schools, no decent govt hospitals, instead of road tax its all toll gates now, all services have become such that we get quality stuff only if we have money. If you even have a road roko demanding water, the police are sent to tackle the situation. The taxes are not used for services of common man!

So the govt will be pro corporates/Crony capitalists but their salary comes from the taxes levied on the common man!

Modi govt policy of taxation is making  the Tax bracket wider but not deeper. What is deeper? The big fat cats, the corporates and crony capitalists are taxed more. What is wider? Making the common man and middle class forcibly pay taxes.

This is the reason why they want everyone to move from cash economy into cashless economy. If we move into cashless what are the benefits? 

They are talking as if the cash economy in itself is illegitimate, and only the cashless economy is legal. But as we've seen above only those are the tax evaders. so if the small, medium businessmen are taxed, what will happen? All their business transactions will come into govt purview. 

Not just that, now we have Aadhaar Card - Like no other card anywhere else in the world, with biometric info - which makes all citizens as criminals! It was brought in as an identity card. Now they are making it mandatory for gas connection, ration card, bank accounts and even education!

The next advertisement is bring all your transactions into your mobile. So who owns this? Ambani. He asks for your Aadhaar card. So all your transactions are visible to him!

All your transactions are under one network. Ambani & the govt are already under a common network! Today Ambani has announced he supports Demonetisation, now can you understand why?

So each and every step of the common man will be under the monitoring of these corporates and the govt! All of the common man's activities will be controlled by them!

So there won't be any more expose' of the rich and mighty. They will be free to do what they want, however they please - the common as their guinea pig!

This is the real reason behind going cashless!

Notes from Prashant Jain - CIO of HDFC Mutual Fund - on budget and beyond.,8,5rz8l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5rz8l0/notes_from_prashant_jain_cio_of_hdfc_mutual_fund/,3,1486218890.0,"Here are the key takeaways from Prashant Jain's talk:
His take on the Budget:

•	Its a no-nonsense Budget

•	Once GST is passed,Budget will become a simple boring affair

•	For first time in 25 years,he was able to leave office by 7-30 pm on Budget Day as there is no major policy changes in the Budget
His take on the Modi Govt:

•	It is a very purposeful and determined Govt

•	The Govt has a few priorities and all its actions can be seen from this framework: 
* Reduce the fiscal deficit: This will result in low inflation,low interest rates and more resources for the private sector
* Increase tax revenues: Demonetization and GST leaves a trail that will widen the tax revenues
*Stopping wasteful expenditures: Direct Cash Transfers using Aadhar and Bank Accounts have reduced siphoning off of funds
*Improve service delivery to common man: Every scheme now has an ""outcome based"" approach instead of ""outlay based"" approach.For example,outcome of all villages electrified,133 kms/per day of roads,10L ponds under MNREGA etc
*Simplify: Using Technology to simplify processes and doing away with redundant laws, policies and practices
*Environment:  Supporting sources of energy like wind,solar etc

•	In the coming years, India will definitely reap the benefits from all the work done by the Govt. His take on Demonetisation: 

* Short term pain for medium and long term good for the people of India
* No impact on this in the next Quarter
* Full effect was not realized due to collusion of Bankers

His take on the India Growth Story:

* India is a secular growth story
* It's gowth increases every year  irrespective of domestic and global conditions

The reasons are as follows: 
* Demographics
* Change from Joint to Nuclear Families
* Low penetration of products/services
* Faster and shorter product cycles
* Real growth in India can cross 8% in the coming years

Why some companies are not growing despite GDP growth:

He gave example of Unilever.Said three reasons why it's sales are stagnant:
* Penetration levels are high.Soaps are there is most households...there are no new customers to be acquired
* Aspirations levels are high.As the consumer's income increases,he is not going to buy more soaps...he will use the money elsewhere
* Competition-As new players like Patanjali come in,they take away market share for existing players as the size of the pie cannot be increased much

Two Sectors of the Economy Doing Badly:
* Real Estate-There is a tremendous demand for real estate but high prices makes it unaffordable. Suffers from high demand,low affordability syndrome
* Private Capital Expenditure- India does not require a power plant for the next 7/8 years.Private players in infra have been burnt badly

Macro Indicators of India are excellent:

Between FY2013 to FY 2016:
•	GDP Growth  increased from 5.6% to 7.6%
•	Fiscal Deficit reduced from 4.9% to 3.9%
•	FDI as % of GDP increased from 1.1% to 1.7%
•	Current Account Deficit reduced from 4.7% to 1.1%
•	CPI reduced from 10.2% to 4.9%
•	10 Year GSec Yield reduced from 8% to 7.5%

For the first time in the history of India ,FDI is more than CAD.

His take on the Sensex:
* Sensex is a very simple animal-it is a slave to earnings
* Short term moves are unpredictable
* Long term it has given a return of 15% CAGR in line with growth of economy
* Foreigners understand Indian equity markets better than locals.
* Their shareholding% of BSE 200 Companies has increased every year.In March 2001,it was 12%.By March 2016, it stands at a whopping 25% !
* Feels Indians should hold equities like they hold gold-for 10-20-50 years


His take on market cycles:
* Indian markets operate on the basis of cycles with clear sector leadership
* Between 1995-2000,IT was the Sector leader.Infosys's PE went from 15 to 300 !
* Between 2000-2008,Capex.Banking and Commodities were the Sector Leaders. Jaiprakash Industries and Unilever India had the same market cap !
* Between 2008-16, Pharma and Consumer were the Sector Leaders
* When one sector takes leadership,all the money goes there and the rest of the markets become very undervalued

Now the time is ripe for beginning of a new market cycle. This new market cycle is characterised by: 
* Low inflation
* Falling interest rates
* Rising Capex
* Peaking NPAs

The sector leaders for this cycle would be Corporate Banking,Metals & Mining and Industrials. His take on the Stock Market:
* The Stock Market is very undervalued.
* The Marketcap to GDP ratio is the lowest in 10 years

His take on various Sectors:

* Corporate Banks-Bullish-NPAs are peaking,Banks are able to recover (e.g. Essar Oil).Makes an interesting point ""Don't confuse NPAs with losses. NPAs are an accounting entry,Loss is permanent erosion of Capital.""
* Metals-Bullish-Feels cycle is turning.Both Tata Steel and JSW Steel have announced fresh capex plans
* FMCG-Bearish-Feels low inflation environment does not favor them.Also,they are expensive
* Pharma-Bearish-Feels they are expensive
* Two Wheelers-Bearish-Feels their penetration is v high.Already 50% of Indian households own a two wheeler
* Auto-Bullish-Increasing incomes,increasing aspiration and low penetration
* Telecom-Confused-Not sure how new entrants will further act.Not possible to get multi-baggers from here
* IT-Confused-Not sure how this sector will play out considering various headwinds
* Insurance-Bearish.Three reasons:  Expensive valuations, GST may increase tax rates for insurers, India is not under-penetrated as far as insurance is concerned
* Consumer/Lingerie-Bearish-Says super expensive trading at peak valuations

All in all, a great & candid talk by one of India's most respected fund managers.

I thought it would be an interesting exercise to seek your views about the Demands for Grants for ministries this year. These documents show how much money is being proposed to be allotted for every ministry. *The increase/decrease in the grants indicates the focus areas of this Government.*

[Here is a summary of all demands](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dgsum.pdf). It will help you quickly glance through the major figures.

[Another detailed summary which will help you see each demand for departments under the ministries](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/alldg.pdf)

[Ministry-wise detailed demands can be found here](http://indiabudget.nic.in/dg.asp?pageid=1)

Example of how we can go about discussing this: I found something interesting [here](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dg30.pdf) with regards to Drinking water and sanitation. The budget for the previous year Rs 12,217 cr, it has been slashed to Rs 6,243 cr.  That's a 48% reduction. I am trying to figure out why is there such a big drop and how it will affect the overall scene of national water resources. 

I must tell you that I am no expert in finance. So perhaps some of you who do work in the area can help me waddle through this massive budget? And in the process, find out what is happening to the ministries that interest you.

If you put up some interesting suggestions, I will include your inputs in the brief I am preparing for MP /u/tathagatasatpathy. 

Session resumes tomorrow and you can follow the budget discussion as it happens. I will alert /r/india regarding that everyday by putting up the [List of Business](http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Business/listOfBusinessCurrent.aspx) for the next day, so that this can become a daily input seeking session.

People far better informed than Mahesh Mu[r]thy explain the gas pricing fiasco with facts,35,22677b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/22677b/people_far_better_informed_than_mahesh_murthy/,47,1396621005.0,"After that atrociously ill-informed post (purportedly by Mahesh Murthy), here's a primer on why the hike in natural gas prices deserves to be stopped.

Exhibit A: [Panel seeks review of Rangarajan formula on gas pricing: The Hindu](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/panel-seeks-review-of-rangarajan-formula-on-gas-pricing/article5476225.ece)


>“It is to be observed that the benefit of lower gas price at Henry Hub has been largely diluted by the inclusion of Japan's liquefied natural gas prices, **which includes 60 per cent royalty component linkage to Japanese Crude Cocktail and host of other factors,**” it said.

>The panel, headed by Andhra Pradesh MP Aruna Kumar Vundavalli, was of the view that **Russia, which exports 40 to 50 per cent of its gas to Europe at a price of about $8.77 per mBtu, could be a better indicator of gas price. Russia is the world's second largest gas producer** and consuming country in the world and its prices could be incorporated as one of the reference price in the pricing formula, it said.

>The committee also pointed at **omission of domestic cost of production of natural gas, which ranges from $2.48 to $3.63 for private and public sector firms**, in the formula.

See also: [Parliamentary panel calls for review of Rangarajan gas price formula: Business Standard](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-12-18/news/45338189_1_national-balancing-point-12-month-trailing-average-price-natural-gas)

Exhibit B: [Rangarajan panel's gas pricing formula might prove too complex](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-01-07/news/36192694_1_domestic-gas-price-henry-hub-netback)

>Unlike other traded commodity markets, **internationally gas prices are of course characterised by disparate regional benchmarks**. The panel wants the price formula reviewed in five years assuming that the gas market, and attendant infrastructure like import terminals and pipelines, would be more developed then. But in the ensuing period, **we surely need policy to induce transparent price discovery in gas** and also develop promising clean-coal technologies like coal gasification and combined-cycle power plants, to effectively manage the explosive demand for gas, and in tandem address its relative short supply in our endowment of natural resources. **The point is that proactive market design and regular scope for price bids for gas should lead to a better demand and supply scenario looking ahead.**

>To determine the domestic gas price, **the panel wants the netback price (that reflects price received by the buyer for his final product) of Indian imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the wellhead of exporting countries**. It would form one set of prices. **The other set of prices proposed is an average of the Henry Hub in the US and the National Balancing Point in the UK, plus netback prices of the sources of LNG supply for Japan.** And the **average of the two sets of prices is what's proposed as the local price of gas**. But while prices in the hubs of the mature markets — with very different supply and demand patterns than here — could be tracked, **determining netback prices for LNG imported into India or Japan would be quite a task. Besides, gas via LNG imports remains quite small here and Japan is hugely energy-efficient.**

Exhibit C: [Oil Ministry moves Cabinet to deny RIL higher gas price: The Hindu](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/oil-ministry-moves-cabinet-to-deny-ril-higher-gas-price/article5120470.ece)

>DGH believes **output from D1&D3 fell to 10.12 million standard cubic metres per day from 53-54 mmscmd achieved in March 2010 because RIL did not drill its committed number of wells**. More wells, it believes, would increase output.

>RIL on the other hand blames **unforeseen geological complexities for the fall in output and believes the reserves in D1&D3 are actually less than one-third of 10.3 Trillion cubic feet predicted** two years before the field began output in April 2009.

>RIL and its partners BP plc of UK and Canada’s Niko Resources has submitted a revised field development plan for D1&D3 to the MC **detailing the lower reserves and the corresponding cut in expenditure from USD 8.8 billion proposed previously.**

Exhibit D: [Moily has junked arbitration to help Reliance, Dasgupta tells court: The Hindu](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/moily-has-junked-arbitration-to-help-reliance-dasgupta-tells-court/article4966030.ece) 

>Senior counsel Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the petitioners, said the decision to raise gas price should be reviewed as **the Minister had overruled the opinion of senior officers of his ministry and his predecessor**. When Justice Sathasivam wanted to know “why the parties can’t go for arbitration,” counsel pointed out that **the Minister had given a statement that he wanted to junk arbitration and that the government would not proceed with the process.**

>The contractors allegedly incurred **investment costs for the full capacity of 80 MMSCMD and recovered all these costs and perhaps more from the government through the sale of gas priced at $4.2 per mmbtu**. Simultaneously, **the contractors deliberately reduced production**, thus holding the country to ransom at a time when gas demand far outstripped supply. **By June 2013, only 9 out of 18 wells were in production and gas sales were only 18% of the target of 80 MMSCMD. The reduction was done in anticipation of a price rise** and this was confirmed by government’s announcement that from April 2014 the price would be increased to $8.4 mmbtu. 

Exhibit E: [Analysis:Faulty formula will lead to faulty gas price: Business Standard](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/analysis-faulty-formula-will-lead-to-faulty-gas-price-113070500564_1.html)

>Nowhere in the world is ‘wellhead’ (price of gas at the discovery well) prices determined in the way it has been done by C Rangarajan. Surya Sethi, former Principal Advisor, Power and Energy, Government of India points out **India is today the only country in the world that sees no difference between the wellhead price of natural gas and Liquefied natural gas (LNG). It is equating price of milk and cottage cheese.**

>Nowhere in the world is wellhead gas price as high as that is India. **If the same average of pithead price and landed prices are applied to other mined products like oil, coal, lignite, iron ore among others, their prices would shoot up.** The other drawback of the formula is there is no cap or floor price of gas and the price is in dollar terms. In the earlier formula, price was capped at $60 per barrel of crude and a portion of the price was pegged to the dollar at a fixed exchange price of Rs 45 against the dollar. **Given the current scenario if oil prices move higher, rupee generally weakens, which would further increase gas price to the consumer.**

Exhibit F: [Of Reliance, by Reliance, for Reliance: The Hindu](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/of-reliance-by-reliance-for-reliance/article4866611.ece)

>First, the government itself admits that **despite raising the domestic wellhead price of natural gas by almost 300 per cent from as low as $1.79/MMBtu to as high as $5.25/MMBtu, investments in the sector and the country’s gas output have actually dropped. The bulk of this drop is because of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)**, the company whose demands triggered the recent price increase. The Comptroller and Auditor General report explicitly outlines how **RIL reneged on its production commitments while gold-plating its investments**. Can the government guarantee that a price of $8.4/MMBtu will raise gas availability? 

>Significantly, the single largest instance of foreign direct investment that the above cited 300 per cent price increase attracted was BP’s acquisition of a 30 per cent stake in RIL’s declining KG basin play and not in any new greenfield frontier. BP is not known to invest $7 billion-plus for improving a country’s fiscal or energy balance. The company must have seen returns from a known discovery even at the then approved price of $4.2/MMBtu.

So why when you spent years and top dollars on facilities and colleges to educate and nurture out politicians with teams of policy think tanks, economic specialists/consultants, economists,etc and through a even more money costing, painstaking process of election you chose the one of the best of the bests to be your leader, to make policies for you, to take the driver seat of your whole country, your whole population, and your economy,

It is a very simplistic way of looking at it imo. As a system, a socialistic, state driven free market works and works how? One has to look only at China and the progress it has made in 30 years to even begin to understand the possibilities of a state directed economy. One has to look at Russia to look at the opposite. When a not so mature economy moves into Capitalistic mode, it can degenerate into an oligopolistic mess..

[State-Directed Development
Political Power and Industrialization in the Global Periphery](http://www.amazon.in/State-Directed-Development-Political-Industrialization-Periphery/dp/0521545250) is a good resource if you want to understand the power of state driven economies. Interestingly Kohli does not even talk about China. For every Air India, we have an IOC. [State owned companies](http://www.economist.com/node/21542931) are even making a comeback these days.

We today blame Nehru for a state run model, but we forget (or don't know) the [Bombay Plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_Plan). A [thesis](http://nzsac.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/bombayplanfornzsac.pdf) on the plan that goes into some details if you are curious.  This plan which was proposed by all the major capitalists of that era ACTUALLY called for a Command Economy with active state participation in some key sectors.

It is also ABSOLUTELY imperative to remember that in 1947-50 when the Nehru govt took the call, the whole world was in awe of the massive industrialisation and victory of Soviet Russia. Even the US had become a command economy after the great depression (for a short while) and again during WW2. It would be a gross crime of [presentism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(literary_and_historical_analysis)) or at best massive hindsight.

**He was only an appointee by Gandhi and was some secondary figure**

Again, this is far from the truth. This man fought and won elections all over the country for close to 15 years. He was the first (modern India's) pan India popular politician, the only other figure that is equal to him in a pan India stature is Modi. He fought and won elections on his own merit not because Gandhi nominated him.

The absolute cock up happened during Indira's regime and later the Rajiv mess of 84-89. She solidified dynasty - Sanjay and later Rajiv. She nationalised banks, chased out foreign investment, introduced Crony Capitalism (Ambani rose to his crowning heights first under her and then under Rajiv), she introduced the maai-baap sarkari model and kind of invented the whole ""perpetuate poverty for vote gains"" model.

Nehru is guilty of a lot of sins, but he is not that terrible villain he is usually made out to be.

Markandey Katju thinks that India is heading towards a 'revolution'.,12,63reu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63reu2/markandey_katju_thinks_that_india_is_heading/,1,1491491104.0,"""India is heading for a Revolution

India is inevitably heading for a revolution. Why do I say so ? Let me explain

India is potentially a highly developed country, but actually a poor and backward country.

It is potentially a highly developed country because it has two of the basic requirements to be a highly developed country, viz. a huge pool of technical talent, and immense natural resources.

This was not the position in 1947 when India became independent. The British policy was broadly to keep India backward, feudal and largely unindustrialized, so that Indian industry may not emerge as a big rival to British industry. So we were not permitted by our British rulers to set up a heavy industrial base, but were permitted only some light industries like textiles, plantations, etc which, too, for a long time were mainly under British ownership. So till 1947 we had very few industries and very few engineers

The position today in 2017 is very different. Today we have a heavy industrial base, and a huge pool of competent engineers, technicians, scientists, managers, etc. Our I.T. engineers are manning Silicon Valley in California, and American Universities are full of our our mathematics and science professors.

In addition, we have immense natural wealth. India is not a small country like England or Japan. It is almost a continent.

So we have all that is required to be a first rate modern, highly developed country, like North America or Europe.

And yet the reality is that we are an underdeveloped, poor country, with massive unemployment, malnourishment, lack of healthcare, good education, etc for our masses.

We can consider some facts :

1. the level of unemployment can be gathered from two facts (a) 1 crore ( 10 million ) youth are entering the Indian job market every year, but only 1.4 lac ( 140, 000 ) jobs are being created every year in the organized sector of the Indian economy. So where do the remaining 9.86 million youth go ? They become hawkers, street vendors, bouncers, criminals, the girls often become prostitutes, and many end up as suicides. In 2015 the U.P. govt. advertised 358 jobs of peons ( chaprasis, i.e. class 4 employees ) for which there were 23 lac ( 2.3 million ) applications. 250 of the applicants had Ph.D. degrees, 2500 were M.Sc., M.B.A. engineers, etc all begging for a [peon's job](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/phd-holders-among-23-lakh-applicants-for-peon-jobs-in-up/story-OqHzHbvo16gUN2DfTkfYlI.html). Something similar happened when police constable's jobs were advertised in Madhya Pradesh, and peon's jobs in West Bengal

2. 50% Indian children are malnourished., which is a situation far worse than in sub Saharan countries of Africa like Somalia. A [UNICEF](http://unicef.in/Story/1124/Nutrition) report says that one out every [three malnourished child in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition_in_India) is an [Indian child](https://www.savethechildren.in/resource-centre/articles/malnutrition-in-india-statistics-state-wise).

3. Poor people in India have hardly any access to healthcare. There are no doubt some excellent hospitals in big cities of India, but they are exorbitantly expensive. Poor patients simply cannot afford good doctors. AIIMS, ( All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, ) looks like a railway station, with thousands of people sitting there, and no one caring for them, unless one is rich or powerful.. So where do the poor people go when they fall sick ? They go to quacks. Quackery is rampant in India.

4. The govt. spends a huge amount of money on I.I.T.s and elite institutions like JNU, but hardly anything for primary schools in villages, where the foundation of knowledge is laid.

5. [57 individuals in India control 70% of India's wealth](http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-interviews-blog/57-billionaires-control-70-of-indias-wealth-india-is-second-most-unequal-economy-after-russia/)

6. Far from there being any 'vikas', the Indian economy is lying stagnant, with chances of genuine growth remote. Whatever 'growth there has been has only benefited a handful of crony capitalists, but not the Indian masses.

According to Mark Twain, there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. Statistics is such a wonderful thing that with its help one can manufacture any figure one wants, like a conjuror pulling a rabbit out of a hat.

The latest figures given by the government of India authorities claiming 7.9 percent growth in GDP in the last quarter is an excellent example, and reminds one of Lord Haw Haw (William Joyce), or the Nazi propaganda minister, Dr Goebbels, who kept proclaiming on radio to the German people right till the very end that Germany was winning the Second World War – when in fact it was losing.

According to this claim, the Indian economy is the fastest growing economy of the world, outstripping the growth in GDP of the Chinese economy, which grew by only 6.9 percent in the same period. Evidently, according to this figure, we are heading for an El Dorado some time in the future, and as Dr Pangloss would say (see Voltaire’s ‘Candide’ ), quoting the German philosopher Leibniz, this is the best of all possible worlds.
But a scrutiny of these figures throws up several doubts. Are the figures true or dressed up, like a Potemkin village? Also, assuming they are true, is this GDP growth benefiting the Indian masses, or only a handful of big businessmen?

Exports have fallen from $187.29 billion in the period April -October 2014, to $156.29 billion in the period April-October 2015, ie a drop of 17.6 percent. So if exports have fallen, and manufacturing has grown by 9 percent, as claimed by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, where have the increased quantity of goods manufactured been sold? In the home market?

But India is a poor country, with 80 percent people holding little purchasing power. And with the sharp escalation in food prices, real incomes have really gone down.

According to the statement of Raghuram Rajan, the RBI governor, most factories are running at 70 percent of their capacity, while in 2011-2012 they were running at 80 percent of their capacity. This apparently shows manufacturing decline, rather than growth. According to a Business Standard report, corporate profitability is below one percent on an average.

Bad loans by banks continue to mount. According to CARE, non-performing assets during July-September, 2015 stood at about Indian Rs3.37 lac crore, an increase of Indian Rs71,000 crore. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, the number of stalled projects – the bulk of them in the manufacturing and infrastructure sectors – went up. Small and medium enterprises are having a difficult time trying to survive. The real-estate sector, which provides a lot of jobs, is down in the dumps, with construction of new buildings going down, and the number of unsold homes going up.

An article by Andy Mukherjee published by Reuters states that the GDP growth of the Indian economy is one third a statistical mirage, and real GDP growth is more likely to be about 5 percent rather than 7.4 percent as claimed by the Indian authorities. Mukherjee says:

>“The illusion comes from a recent supposed improvement in the way India calculates its Gross Domestic Product. In theory, Indian authorities claim that Indian GDP is close to international standards. In practice it has become utterly unreliable.”

What is the real GDP growth of the Indian economy? [Breakingviews.com](https://www.breakingviews.com/) answered that question by looking at three indicators: corporate earnings, auto sales and imports of computer software (since retained earnings finance new investment projects, auto sales are a proxy for consumer demand while software imports reflect productivity gains). Mixing the three in a simple index suggests that growth in the most recent quarter was closer to 5 percent.

But let us assume that the 7.9 percent figure is correct. The further question that still remains is: is this GDP growth benefiting the Indian masses, or just a handful of big businessmen? Is the rich-poor divide growing? Dilip Shanghvi, Gautam Adani, Mukesh Ambani, Aziz Premji, Pallonji Mistry, etc are worth billions of dollars, while the majority of Indians are struggling to make both ends meet, as prices of food soar.

What has happened to the slogan ‘sab ka saath, sab ka vikas’? It seems it was only a ‘jumla’. The communal fire is being stoked up again in UP and elsewhere. When there is an economic crisis which the govt. cannot resolve, it resorts to fascist methods, as it happened in Germany and Italy with the rise to power of Hitler and Mussolini

To abolish all this, and raise the standard of living of our people – that must be the goal of all patriotic modern minded people--. we have to create a modern, highly industrialised country in which all our citizens are getting decent lives.
But what has this government done in this direction? The answer is: a big zero, and only jumlas and dramas.
The test of every government or system is one – and only one: is the standard of living of the masses rising under it or not? If not, the government or system is a failure. From this standpoint (and it is the only correct standpoint), the Modi government, like the previous Manmohan Singh govt., is a total failure on all fronts
The question naturally arises that when we have all that is required to be a first rate highly developed country, why is India still poor and backward ?
The answer is that apart from the two requirements to become a highly developed country mentioned above, viz. a huge pool of technical talent, and huge natural resources, there is also a third requirement, which unfortunately we do not have, and that is a modern minded, patriotic political leadership. Let me explain this in some detail.
India borrowed the parliamentary system of democracy from England, and incorporated it into our Constitution. Now parliamentary democracy is based on majority vote, but the truth is that the vast majority of people in India are intellectually very backward, their minds full of casteism, communalism and superstitions. So when most indians go to vote they do not see the merit of the candidate, whether he is a good man or bad, educated or not, etc, but only see the candidate's caste or religion ( or the party representing a caste or religion ). That is why there are so many people with criminal antecedents in our legislatures.

Our cunning politicians take advantage of this, and have learnt the skill of manipulating caste and religious vote banks.

The interest of the nation is to rapidly modernize, for which it is necessary to destroy feudal forces like casteism and communalism. On the other hand, the interest of our politicians is to win the next elections, and for that they have to appeal to, and therefore perpetuate, casteism and communalism, which are feudal forces. Therefore the interest of our country, and the interest of our politicians are diametrically opposite to each other. How, then, can our country progress ?
Most of the Indian politicians are rogues, rascals, gundas, criminals, scoundrels, looters and gangsters. They have no genuine love for the country, but only seek power and pelf. They are shameless and incorrigible, and cannot be reformed. They are experts in manipulating caste and communal vote banks, and they polarize society by spreading caste and communal hatred. Don't such people deserve to be shot, like mad dogs, or like the aristocrats in the French Revolution who were guillotined?
It is thus obvious that parliamentary democracy is not suited to India. Our Constitution has exhausted itself, our 'democracy' has been hijacked by feudal minded people, and all our state institutions have become hollow and empty shells.

On the other hand, the socio-economic distress of our people keeps mounting.

I submit that the solutions to the massive problems of India lie outside the system, not within it. No amount of reforms will do, what is now required is a revolution. What form this revolution will take, and how much time, cannot be predicted, but what certainly can be predicted is that it is coming.
It is only after such a revolution, which will be led by some genuinely patriotic, modern minded persons, that a just social order will be created in India, in which our masses get decent lives, and a high standard of living.""

Can people here suggest me some good economics resources to read. I am not looking for any theoretical content. More on the lines of economics through real life examples. 

Resources which will help me extrapolate understanding for questions like

1. Whether ""Make in India"" is great, good, too late, too small ? Whether it should be ""Make for India - Rajan's view"" ? What will be the difference in policy initiatives that will lead to them individually ?

2. Indian Economics: Why balance between inflation and interest is needed. Difference of opinion between Jaitley and Rajan. Balance between infra spending and fiscal prudence.

2. US model of growth VS China model of Growth Vs Singapore/Vietnam/South Asian Economies Model of Growth. What principles/policy decisions make these models of growth ?

3. How does a state decide how much to mix welfare economics with free market economics and how does it scale ? What are the tradeoffs around them ? 

4. Does free market economics lead to concentration of wealth ? Is it good, bad, ugly in longer term ? Does orgs that benefit from free market economics try to scuttle it later to attempt monopolies ? How can that be countered ?

etc. etc.

IMHO, overall I am looking for something like Eco 101 and may be Eco elective around Macro. But pls. with examples. Or otherwise it just doesn't stick. I have tried reading it through wiki :(

1. In November 1994, printing of 1 rupee notes was terminated predominantly due to the prohibitive cost of printing. As far as this goes, why does RBI want to put them in circulation again?  


  
If you have any such question then let me know. Will soon update after the meet

Proof that I met him : [Raghuram Rajan's Autograph](http://imgur.com/bE58vPc)

He didn't answer all the questions but some if which he did answered are jotted down 
 
**Regarding PSU Banks**   

He says that large banks i.e the big players didn't want to have regulators for small banks and wanted to avoid that. But He (R_R) believed that they stand an equal chance as them and deserved to compete in the market. They need to be given opportunity to create a business and shape-up the economy.   
He quoted saying "" If they can't compete then don't deserve to exist ""  

**Regarding Bitcoin**  

RBI didn't fail to understand bitcoin, it just alarmed people that its highly volatile. He was quite fascinated by the innovation of bitcoin but at the same time believes that they can't replace the currency as over-regulation might happen anytime with it and you can't control it.   
He cited the example of movie ' GURU ' of how he tried to regulate the business but ended up failing to decide the future of what he was doing.  

*""It's a good innovation and the direction is right but need something more stable, and BITCOIN isn't the answer""*
   
**Regarding how is his communication with FM,PM and other institutes**

He jokingly answer it by telling *'using phone, emails, fax and letter'* but then told that there were certain discontent between them while deciding on policies and public matters of which  some results of the meeting weren't what he wanted.  

**On GST**

Lesser people pay tax-logistics but he believes GST will allow more people to pay the tax and improve efficiency

**His Advice to Youngsters** 

*""Challenge yourself. Don't Do boring stuff. If its interesting, Learn it. Don't be a master in one thing, move to other challenges once you master one thing, that will help you remain down to earth.""*  

**Asked him when he plans to join Quora**

"The National Identity VI: The undeclared war between two Indias, and the one state which won it",23,5dkkf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5dkkf4/the_national_identity_vi_the_undeclared_war/,0,1479472361.0,"*Operation Green Hunt mobilized close to 50,000 paramilitary personnel and turned a little known place in the center of India into one of the world’s most militarized zone. Bastar, turned into the eye of the storm in the all out offensive that the Indian government launched against the Naxals (Maoists) in September/November 2009. And the Indian government denies its’ existence.*

>“Yes. I want to become a Maoist if this is the model of development. But I can’t at this age” – V.P. Singh, Former Prime Minister of India (And he instead gave India the Mandal Commission)

The heavy concentration of paramilitary forces, also gave the Naxals a unique opportunity – to inflict a death toll on the central forces, the likes of which India hadn’t seen in close to fifty years. The Home Minister, P Chidambaram, had called the Naxals “cowards enacting dramas”, which would be a grave insult to any self-respecting fighting force the world has seen, let alone one which stretches across half the sub-continent and have automatic weapons. The Naxals had long been used to being ridiculed in New Delhi, V.P Singh’s mockery included.

In response to Operation Green Hunt, the Naxals planned and executed The Dantewada massacre, in which the Naxals, for the loss of eight, killed 76 security personnel. It was the largest casualty the country had suffered in any one attack.
Naxalism, or violent Maoism, has often been identified as the gravest threat to the nation. Yet it is seldom a topic of national interest, or debate. The Naxals have declared large swathes of land as “liberated zones”. This implies no government interference and no government presence. Perhaps because these zones exist in the forests and tribal belts of India, far away from the eyes of the Indian media which is surprisingly uncritical in its research and discussing topics of national importance.

Naxalism has deep roots in India and is present across large swathes of West Bengal, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and now Telangana. Only one state has been remotely successful in countering the growing tide of Naxalism and that was erstwhile Andhra Pradesh. It is often a model that the Center asks the other states to employ, without knowing the elements which made the Andhra chapter successful. The Center has implored other states to create “special forces” from within their state police forces, modeled after the hugely successful Greyhounds of AP Police. Home Minister P Chidambaram said in 2009 that he would “eradicate” the Naxals in the next two to three years, without knowing that the one successful example he had of “victory” took more than a decade.

The Andhra Pradesh government’s home run wasn’t the formation of the Greyhounds unit, nor was it the employment provided to the tribals, but intelligence gathering. It is one of India’s rare examples of effective intelligence gathering and processing. Special Forces units all over the world depend on precise and actionable intelligence. It is the basis for all their operations – there would be nothing special about them if they are inserted into a conflict zone and turn into sitting ducks because of poor intelligence. With the deep penetration of Naxals that the Andhra Pradesh government achieved, intelligence was well sourced and could strike at the heart of the State’s Naxal apparatus.

The Maoists have long used “talks” with the Government to retrench and regroup – deep inside the forests. The Dandakaranya forest, which covers nearly 50,000 sqkm, stretches across Maharashtra, Chattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh, is an area so fiercely guarded that it hasn’t been topographically surveyed – ever. This liberated zone also serves as the Military HQ of the Naxals. The strategy of using talks to regroup isn’t new and was deployed to devastating effect in Dantewada. It is said that at the time of the massacre the Naxal leader Kishanji had even given the Home Minister P Chidambaram his mobile phone number to further ceasefire talks. It only served to lure an unsuspecting column of 80 soldiers deeper and deeper inside the forests the Naxals consider their own. 76 of the 80 were killed.

The Andhra Pradesh government was well acquainted with this strategy and never stopped embedding newer elements or collecting intelligence from existing sources, during the cease fire and peace negotiations, which on paper at least would stretch for years. This is what ultimately helped the government eradicate the Naxals from large swathes of land when the talks broke down. The government largely believed in kick-starting any offensive with Intelligence-based operations as opposed to massive area-domination exercises. Not only do area domination exercises without proper intelligence and maps raise the specter of a Dantewada like massacre, they serve little purpose if the police outposts in these regions are not further fortified and become logistically well served. The biggest lesson learned from the Andhra episode is that preparation and intelligence gathering should never cease. Years, sometimes even decades, of information gathering provide the state enough evidence to authorize a special forces strike.

>“The Maoist movement is a symbol of the divide between rural and urban India. The movement cannot be solved by police action at all. There could be a time when Maoists could overrun urban citadels” – M.K. Dhar, Joint Director of the Intelligence Bureau

Development programs are imperative for any “hearts and minds” strategy and the Andhra Pradesh government launched two such programs in the late 2000’s. The first initiative was known as Remote Areas Development Programme; and the second is known as Remote and Interior Areas Development Programme. Both these programs focused on developing the areas which had been Naxal infested for almost all of Independent India’s history. Not only were the Naxals disenfranchised from the growing economy, perhaps by choice, but so were the tribals in these areas because of Naxal pressure – and this was seldom a “choice” they got to make. Stories of Naxal brutality against informers and republic sympathizers would make one shudder. Other development programmes such as Jalayagnam and Indiramma were also initiated, which ensured the state finally had a service delivery mechanism which reached these interiors. 

Whilst these programs brought about inclusiveness for the people living in these areas, they also served as the arteries to transport weapons, services and personnel to the chronically understaffed and under-protected police outposts in the region. By strengthening the police outposts, the state also sent out a message to informers, defectors and those wishing to give up arms, that it could protect them.

Another leg of the strategy was the Surrender and Rehabilitation program. Large sections of the Naxal’s fighting force are known to have been coerced into joining them. It was these sections which the Government targeted. Even if they didn’t turn into informers for the state, the government knew that they could only be “successful” if they could rehabilitate the ones who gave up arms. Stories of police brutality, after all, travel much faster in India. Between 2003 and 2006, 1848 Naxals gave up their ideology and surrendered to the state. The rehabilitation programs then included them in the mainstream economy, rather than letting them go back to the lives they earlier led. Victim Reassurance Policies such as civilian rehabilitation, and also police rehabilitation, played its’ part in a successful strategy against the Naxals.
If other states, and the Center, continue to think that merely forming special forces groups in their police force would ensure victory then Andhra Pradesh has another lesson. The Greyhounds Unit was formed in 1989 and Naxalism wasn’t curbed until well into the millennium. Odisha and Chattisgarh, then, are at least another decade away from *freeing their liberated zones.*

This could only have been if we had a huge dependence on communist policies. Just wanted to get an idea about this and how India changed post opening up of the economy. 

I'm mainly talking about personal impact, like how demonetisation is affecting the common public. What was it like back in 1989-1992 and onwards.

###1947: The state of agriculture

The biggest influence on agriculture in India today can be traced back to the British. Through centuries of destructive trade policies, a single-minded policy geared towards collection of land revenues, and co-opting the richest elements of Indian society, they destroyed the eventual process of industrialisation, and left Indian artisans and farmers in a pitiable state. Nevertheless, there were some positives, characteristic of the British rule. The expansion of canal irrigation, which the British initiated and supported, provides irrigation to areas across the country till date. 

On the eve of independence, there were tons of problems facing Indian agriculture.

- Land problems:
    Most of the land was owned by landlords or moneylenders, and the actual farmers had merely the status of tenants on the land. In addition, most of the land was fragmented, through sale and inheritance, into very small plots of sometimes untillable sizes. Thus, most farmers were subsistence farmers, growing only enough for their own needs.

- Production problems:
    Indian farmers, by and large, still depended on the monsoon for rains. All irrigation systems covered only about 14% of the arable land. In addition, yields of most crops were woefully low, due to the utter absence of any kind of technology or capital investment. 

- Financial problems:
    Most farmers were extremely poor, and had very little chance of tolerating any kind of mishap to their crop. Rural credit was available only through usurious landlords. In addition, access to markets was hampered by poor infrastructure, and cartels of traders who conspired to buy crops at lower rates. 

- Human problems:
    Agriculture, at the time, employed nearly 70% of the Indian population. The production of food grains was insufficient for consumption. In 1951, for example, nearly 4.5 million tons of food grains had to be imported, compared to the production of of about 45 million tons. The threat of famine was ever-present. Most farmers were illiterate and unaware of modern practices. The land situation was intricately tied in with the complicated and stratified rural society, making change incredibly hard.
		
###The first five year plans

The  first five year plan attempted to tackle most of these problems on a war footing. Giving the ""highest priority"" to agriculture, nearly 31% of plan expenditure  from 1951-56 was devoted to agriculture and allied sectors. The main policy of the plan, which has been followed by every single successive government, was to try and provide an economical livelihood for the farmers, with a degree of financial safety, while simultaneously ensuring that sufficient food was available to feed everyone in the country. 

Perhaps predictably, the greatest emphasis was laid on increasing agricultural production. Nobody wanted to see a famine, and food sufficiency was a matter of national security as well. A multi-pronged, top-down approach was adopted: several large irrigation/hydropower dams were constructed, agricultural research institutes were founded, as were PSUs for the production of fertilisers and pesticides. ""Community development programs"" and ""agricultural extension services"" were provided throughout the country, and efforts were made to promote rural credit. 

Simultaneously, most state governments passed land reforms laws, guaranteeing tenancy rights and land ceilings. Implementation of these, though, varied wildly from state to state. In several states, land reforms were half-heartedly implemented due to stiff political opposition from landlords. 

The first Plan was fairly successful in achieving its overall production targets. A production of 62 million tons of foodgrains was targeted, and 67 million tons was achieved. 
	
###Government intervention in markets
	
- PDS (Public Distribution System): The PDS was first intended to be a mechanism for ensuring minimum food supplies to cities. In a situation where famine was a real possibility, and traders in cities were notorious for trading, it was felt that a government rationing of food, and limited supply through fair price shops, would help avoid famine. By the 1960s, the PDS had morphed into a food supply scheme at subsidised rates to the entire population. 

- MSP (Minimum Support Price): The Government announces a minimum support price for certain crops. Essentially, the Government commits itself to buying considerable quantities of grain at a ""reasonable"" price , usually set higher than the production costs for that grain. This has the effect of increasing prices overall, as any farmer who gets a lower price than the MSP, can in theory choose to sell to the Government instead. The government buys and sells food through the Food Corporation of India
	
The PDS and the MSP form the two legs of the Hercules that is the food subsidy system in India. The overall system at present operates as follows: http://i.imgur.com/3eAMM.png

		
###The Green and dietary revolutions
	
Since the PDS/MSP regime was put into place, there have been two major changes. The Green Revolution succeeded in finally eliminating the deficits of foodgrains which the country had persistently been facing. Productivity of rice and wheat shot up in irrigated areas, especially Punjab and Haryana, due to the usage of high yielding varieties of crops, machinery, and chemical inputs. Thus, the overall situation of the economy was transformed from a calorie deficit to a calorie surplus economy. 
	
Everyone's heard of the green revolution, but not too many people are aware of the second, equally important factor influencing Indian agriculture today: The dietary revolution. With increasing prosperity and a greater variety of foods produced in India, people started shifting from a cereal-intensive diet to a more diversified diet. For example, in rural India, the consumption of cereals declined by 17%, while the consumption of edible oils, dairy products, and meats increased by 45%, 18%, and 65% respectively, between 2002 and 1992. 

There is some debate on what the dietary shift implies, especially for the poorest section of society. One section of people believe that this means that the poor are deliberately spending more on diverse sources of food, whereas another section believes that despite the diversification, the absolute amount of calories consumed have reduced, which means that malnourishment has increased. What is not disputed, though, is that the change in diet has taken place, across all sections of society.
		
	
###The curious case of the rotting grains
	
Now we have all the ingredients to explain the situation.
	
- The states, under political pressure from farmers, hikes the MSP beyond the Centrally mandated MSP. 
- This causes the FCI to procure grain at rates higher than the open market rates for newly harvested grain. 
- The eventual sale of this grain at these higher rates ends up increasing the price of wholesale grain, and thus reaches consumers at a higher price
- This higher price further reduces the demand for foodgrains, and leaves the FCI with excess foodgrains, as its initial procurements don't take into account the reduced demand
- In an ideal scenario, the reduced demand will lead to reduced prices of foodgrains, causing farmers to switch their next crops to other, more valuable crops. However, the artificially high MSP hides the fact that there is reduced demand for foodgrains from the farmers, many of whom continue to grow foodgrains
- When there is no demand for these foodgrains, farmers mobilise politically, and demand a hike of the MSP in order to prevent catastrophic losses. Thus the vicious cycle continues. 
- Thus, every year, the FCI ends up procuring grain far in excess of what is needed, and is forced to dispose it a huge loss.
		
Earlier, while the economy was in a foodgrain deficit, grains procured even in excess would have been easily sold at market rates due to high demand. The entire system has now broken down, now that we have enough food in aggregate to feed ourselves. 
Of course, given the inefficiencies of the PDS, and the fact that quotas are centrally set, this means that grains in Haryana and Punjab sit idle, while BPL individuals do not benefit from the extra procured grains.

Birth Anniversary of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj,1,6jkei3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6jkei3/birth_anniversary_of_chhatrapati_shahu_maharaj/,0,1498503875.0,"In the history of the world, Shahu Maharaj shines like the brightest stars in the galaxy who renounced everything for the welfare of suffering humanity. Shahu came to power when everything was in the flux in India. India was ruled by the British. They controlled 11 British Provinces and exercised indirect control over 500 princely states. The princes could micro-manage their empire, but the macro-management like defense and external relationship was left to the British. Shahu Maharaj was the prince of the Kolhapur state. Shahu Maharaj was trained to be a ruler by the British officials and seniors in his state. He studied many subjects, but also his theoretical training was supplemented by extensive field work. He traveled all over the places in India. He went abroad to study. He was trained as an able administrator and he worked very hard to be an able administrator. His life proved how one man can make a difference in the lives of many. He demonstrated how public policies can actually be worked out to remove contradictions in the society.

Shahu Maharaj experienced the Brahmin arrogance first hand in what is now famous as “Vedokta” episode. Shahu was not allowed to hear the recitation of “Vedas” because he was the Shudra according to Brahmins. Earlier in the history, Mahatma Jotiba Phule was insulted by the Brahmins and he launched the non-Brahmin movement. His movement gained strength and influenced the course of history by creating true foundation of Indian nationhood. His movement was still fresh when Shahu came to the scene. Jotiba’s close friend, Dada Keluskar, the leader of non-Brahmin movement was close to Shahu Maharaj as well. Shahu tried to keep the torch burning by fostering and supporting the movement started by Jotiba. Shahu became the staunch admirer of the non-Brahmin movement when he saw how his administration was dominated by the Brahmins. In his bid to create equitable and efficient system of Governance, he initiated many policies, but the most significant was the policy of reservation. He reserved seats for the non-Brahmins in his administration. He also came up with the idea of reverse treatment to the Brahmins who dominated his administration and at times schemed against their own Maharaj. He created a negative list of those who were overly represented in the Government. Perhaps, it is time in India to think about “reverse” discrimination, in a sense that a “negative list” of those communities dominate every organ of the governance in India today. The communities which are listed in the “negative list” should be given representation according to their proportion of population and the communities in the “positive list” must be advanced to various positions by creating level playing field.

Shahu enacted other schemes that will benefit his people. The state of Kolhapur saw advent of industries and growing economy under his reign. He built dams and markets for the economic growth, but he was not just interested in the economic growth, but his interest was primarily economic and human development. He started boarding schools for the untouchables and started special scholarships for the marginalized people. He also stressed on the education of the girls. His state policies were cleverly designed and meticulously executed.

But his greatest contribution came as the leader of the non-Brahmins. In the Mangaon conference held in 1920, Maharaj invited great leaders from all over India, including great Buddhist monk, Bhante Bodhanand. And, young Bhim was given the prominent place in the conference. In his conference, the great Maharaj declared young Bhim the leader of the non-Brahmins and their future leader. Friendship between Babasaheb Ambedkar and Shahu Maharaj is an example of how people should relate with each other as friends and colleagues. The letters exchanged between them are moving testimony of the commitment to the cause bigger than one human life span. Babasaheb requested and Maharaj obliged. Maharaj requested and Babasaheb followed. Such was their friendship that when Maharaj died, Babasaheb was devastated. Maharaj supported every single initiative of Babasaheb Ambedkar. Maharaj gave funds for “MookNayak”, the first newspaper Babasaheb Ambedkar started. Maharaj gave scholarship to Babasaheb to finish his education. When India was seeing the possibilities of electoral democracy in 1930s, Maharaj was willing to support the politics of the non-Brahmins fully. He was committed to make non-Brahmin movement an all India movement. Maharaj stood behind Babasaheb like the solid tower of strength.",5

Can a country which is diverse/divided as India beat the middle-income trap and become a developed nation?,2,3rl9xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3rl9xt/can_a_country_which_is_diversedivided_as_india/,18,1446727577.0,"If we look at history, there are only a handful of nations who have gone from being undeveloped/backward to an advanced economy. Notable examples are Japan, Germany, and Israel. If we look at each of these countries, they have 1 thing in common, which is the people are extremely supportive of their country. Germany is the only country I can recall which has managed to unite after being divided. The people in all 3 countries are die hard nationalists (will literally kill themselves for the country). The reason this is important is because most other countries get stuck in the middle income trap (latin America, south east asia like Thailand, Malaysia). As a country tries to become developed, some un popular policies sometimes need to be passed, something which is hard to do in a divided country. For instance in Latin America everytime a pro-market guy comes, some socialist govs come back in power and pass socialist policies which push back the country (as is happening right now in Brazil). Socialist policies aren't bad, but certain policies unpopular policies have to be passed, and it is very hard to do in a divided country, only when people are very strongly for their country do such legislations pass. So as India approaches middle income status, I wonder if it will emerge from the middle income trap or stay stuck in this vicious cycle. I have a strong fear we may be trapped, because if a super popular leader like Modi can't pass basic bills with ease (GST, insurance, etc.) I wonder what would happen. What do you guys think, r/india?

Edit: People are taking this to mean we need to end social programs. I am not saying that, but I am saying a fine balance needs to be striked, which is hard to happen cause of populist votes.",5
The National Identity XII: “Tawang must not fall”,7,5q8yz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5q8yz2/the_national_identity_xii_tawang_must_not_fall/,0,1485444130.0,"*In 1962 the Indian Army was at its’ lowest in over 200 years. The Indian Army acquitted itself reasonably well in the Western Ladakh sector; but its’ performance on the Eastern front (in Arunachal and Sikkim) was abysmal. While there were certainly accentuating factors, including political, the Indian Army had to pull itself by its’ bootstraps and wrench itself into countering the new paradigm of foes on the Eastern, Western and Northern fronts. The Army (and the MoD) responded by raising six new divisions — four infantry divisions and two mountain divisions, and setting up the Officers Training Academy in Madras.*
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*General KV Krishna Rao was confident that his operational plan for countering possible Chinese aggression in the North East would be met with a positive response from the Prime Minister’s Office. The year was 1983 and Indira Gandhi had just been voted back in, and with the scars of the Emergency still raw, she was eager to focus on foreign, rather than domestic, enemies. This was a strategy which her son Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi largely continued. For more than twenty years, India had not entered the theater of its’ most humiliating defeat. The Army top brass had impressed upon her the need to defend Tawang as opposed to the previous establishment view that in the event of a Chinese attack, India would abandon Tawang and regroup and fight near the Se La; to Tawang’s east. Se La is the crucial link between Tawang and Bomdila.*

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Operation Falcon — the genesis of boots on the ground**

Operation Falcon, presented that day in 1983 to Indira Gandhi, involved converting sporadic presence around the border to a more permanent structured arc-like defence of Tawang. For two successive summers Indian forces would go up to the Hathung La ridge to set up tents and return in the winter. 

**Sumdorong Chu — June 1986**. The Indian soldiers received a rude awakening when they returned to Hathung La in the summer of 1986. Chinese soldiers had already built semi-permanent structures in the Indian territory around Hathung La and these were later fortified by the construction of a helipad. After repeated dismissals of “official protests” lodged by India, General Sundarji, with typical panache, airlifted an entire Infantry brigade of 5 Mountain Division to Zimithang; a landing area close to Sumdorong. The positions occupied by this brigade overlooked the Sumdorong Chu valley along with the Hathung La and Langor La ridges. For the first time since its’ humiliating retreat from these pastures, India held Hathung La.

China, which always maintained a large military presence in Tibet was said to have moved in 20,000 troops from the “53rd Army Corps in Chengdu and the 13th Army in Lanzhou” by early 1987 along with heavy artillery and helicopters. By early April, it had moved 8 divisions to eastern Tibet. The Indian Army responded with Operation Chequerboard, which involved 10 divisions of the Army along with multiple squadrons of the Indian Air Force. These reinforcements were in addition to the 50,000 various military and paramilitary forces already stationed in Arunachal Pradesh. The Indian Army was stretched beyond its’ limits in carrying out armour heavy operations on the Western front and Operation Chequerboard on the Eastern. 

Supposedly culled by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1988 to assuage Chinese concerns, and to curtail the hawkish behaviour of [General Sundarji](https://medium.com/@der_Wille/the-national-identity-xi-the-story-of-indias-most-ambitious-hawk-c85affbdecc1), the Army was never going to vacate these icy heights. Fresh off a string of high altitude victories in [Operation Meghdoot](https://medium.com/@der_Wille/the-national-identity-x-indias-longest-and-most-expensive-military-operation-c42833582270) on the Siachen Glacier, Operation Falcon remained in effect and continues to remain an active operation more than 30 years later, without government notification. 

Fatalities and other injuries, once the Operation is notified, receive a higher compensation. But Operation Falcon has been shot down at the Ministry of Defence level for the past 30 years. A soldier passing away in Siachen (Operation Meghdoot) is labelled a battle casualty and the family is entitled to a higher payout whereas a soldier passing away in the treacherous terrain in Western Ladakh, Arunachal and Sikkim is not entitled to the same. The government’s reluctance in angering China by notifying this Operation is quite evident. 

In a way, India’s assertive response in 1987 through Operation Chequerboard was a success — India succeeded in breaking through the logjam of “official level talks” of the 1981–88 period and was able to sign binding border agreements in 1993 and 1996. India occupied the Hathung La ridge again, almost 25 years after its’ humiliating retreat.

>“Tawang must not fall” — Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to the Army top brass

India’s entire China strategy since Independence can be summed up by those four words. India didn’t have a China strategy till it went to war with her in 1962 and then for over 25 years cowered around in shame, trying to avoid defending the areas it was abjectly driven out of. In the years since, the only political reference provided to the Army has been, “Tawang must not fall”. Even the Parliamentary Standing Committee on defence stated in 2015 that the Indian Army will take a day to reach Tawang whereas China can have her forces stationed there in 2–3 hours. 

**It would be creaking infrastructure; if it was actually there!**

The apathy towards the Chinese threat is quite evident; with the economy booming in the early years of the millennium, it was quite easy for the government to neglect building strategic road and rail links to the North East. The China Study Group under Prime Minister Vajpayee had identified 73 strategic road links in 2001, which would connect the frontier areas, and when Defence Minister AK Antony announced to the Parliament in December 2011, a decade later, that only 13 of the 73 roads were complete — it was met with hardly a murmur. 

With more than 50 strategic road links yet to be completed, the government recently announced the construction of another 55. Suffice to say, we would still be waiting for these road links in twenty years time. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The frozen Mountain Corps**

More than thirty years after the meeting between Indira Gandhi and General KV Krishna Rao, Defence Minister AK Antony met General Bikram Singh in 2013. The Chinese Army had made deep incursions of 19km into Indian territory in Ladakh and the “misadventures” on the Eastern border too continued unabated. The need to counter the Chinese threat, in a unified militaristic response, all along the LAC had evolved from an “Operation” requiring airlifting troops from nearby Division and Corps headquarters to a more permanent boots on the ground strategy. AK Antony cleared the creation of a Mountain Strike Corps; the XVII Corps.

The XVII Corps will be expected to combat the Chinese threat across three well defined sectors — the Western (Ladakh), the Middle (Himachal and Uttarakhand) and the Eastern (Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim). While a monumental military task, it is also compounded by deep geographical disadvantages. Indian troops facing Chinese soldiers on the Eastern front have to go through a three stage acclimatization protocol to man posts at heights of over 16000 ft; Chinese soldiers already live on the Tibetan plateau — at that altitude. China also holds strategic depth on the Eastern front (something Siachen provides India on the Western front with China); a gap it bridges with the deployment of Rapid Reaction Divisions (RRDs) whereas XVII Corps would have to traverse inhospitable terrain and high altitude passes and combat an unpredictable environment to put men and equipment to defend Tawang. 

Highlighting the first disadvantage is the fact that the second mountain division under XVII Corps, 72 Mountain Div, was planned to be set up in Pathankot; at an elevation of 1000ft. This division, in the event of a limited or a full blown war (as part of a Strike Corps), would have to traverse passes of over 22000 ft. and be expected to fight at an average elevation of 16000 ft. This strategy would be the modern equivalent of the debacle of 1962 — soldiers in white gym shoes fighting in knee deep snow. India’s double pivot is also quite evident in the location — in times of need; this mountain division can pivot towards Pakistan. A similar problem was highlighted in 1959, when the Red Eagle Division, 4 Infantry Div, stationed at Ambala was tasked to man 1800km of mountainous terrain in Sikkim and (then) NEFA — an Infantry division back then occupied an area frontage of only 30–40km; in the plains! The development of this “mountain” division has currently been put on hold.

India’s budgetary allocations for the raising of this Corps have not been commensurate with the assigned strength. While an initial strength of 90,000 was announced by UPA II in 2013, at a cost of Rs.64,000 crore; it has since been pared by the BJP government to Rs. 38,000 crore and 35,000 men. 59 Mountain Division in Pangarh, West Bengal, has already been raised but the 72 Mountain Division in Pathankot has been halted. Assimilating the newly raised Division into an existing holding Corps (and doing the same with the division in North India) would lead to different challenges — active offensive divisions would be under different operational commands. China counters such delineation by maintaining a unified TAR (Tibetan Autonomous Region) command. Not just ground forces, but even air support is controlled by a single PLA commander stationed in the TAR. 

**The need for a post-military solution**

>“The Chinese word for China — Chung-kuo, or the Middle Kingdom — both conveys the notion of China’s centrality in world affairs and reaffirms the importance of national unity. That perspective also implies a hierarchical radiation of influence from the centre to the peripheries, and thus China as the centre expects deference from others.” The United States’ strategist, Zbigniew Brzezinski in his book, The Grand Chessboard

Understanding the Chinese threat to India is the first step in effectively combating it. At the highest diplomatic levels; China’s power far outstretches India’s — China has essentially never made a concession to India at any diplomatic level for over sixty years. Recent evidence include vetoing a motion to label Masood Azhar a terrorist and blocking India’s entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group. At a more operational level, Chinese show of strength along the border is a frequent occurrence. China has also lent its’ full scale support, stopping short of a bilateral military agreement, to Pakistan. (The lopsided Indo-Chinese trade balance and China’s economic prowess… well that’s another post altogether!)

The XVII Corps can effectively combat only one of these four threats — to counter aggressive border patrols; and even this, technically, should be the mandate of a holding Corps, not a Strike Corps. According to the data released by the Home Ministry, the PLA made 1062 incursions into Indian territory from 2010–2014, so the need to counter these incursions, at the tactical level, is an important task. But the onerous task of guarding the border from Chinese aggression requires a far greater effort from all wings of India’s government and military establishments. 

A capability, and not a threat, based approach is required from the Army to counter the Chinese military threat. [General Sundarji](https://medium.com/@der_Wille/the-national-identity-xi-the-story-of-indias-most-ambitious-hawk-c85affbdecc1), was the first Chief to begin a process of modelling the Army’s capability rather than its’ response to threats. However, the Army has made slow progress on this front. He earmarked the Hyderabad based 54 Div to be converted into an air assault division — a process yet to be completed. 

Also, little new thought has come out of the Indian army in decades — its’ almost exclusive focus on combating insurgency has been detrimental to its’ evolution. This is further cemented by [General Rawat’s appointment](https://medium.com/@der_Wille/the-national-identity-xii-the-games-generals-play-and-they-need-to-stop-d4626e3da18a); and his counter insurgency credentials. Uncharacteristically the Para Special Forces are being used for tactical operations like flushing out terrorists from buildings, rather than strategic purposes.

The Army also has its’ hand tied as proven by the tardy pace of raising XVII Corps. Raising of this Corps requires roads to be built by the Border Roads Organization (now under the MoD) and by the ITBP and Central and State Public Works Departments (Home Ministry and State Governments). Procurement requires budgetary approvals (Ministry of Finance) whereas an overall deployment doctrine requires a coordinated strategy from the Prime Minsiter’s Office, the National Security Advisor, the Defence and Foreign Ministers apart from all the service chiefs.

India is just about coming to grips with the fourth generation warfare unleashed by Pakistan — where it bases its attacks on asymmetry and autonomy of both regular (Army and paramilitary forces) and irregular forces (under the auspices of the ISI). Former General Ashfaq Kayani became the first Chief of the Army to have served as the Director General of the ISI and Military Operations (DGMO). Pakistan has understood the new doctrine of warfare quite well; and Operation Badr (Kargil’99) was in their books a success — no regular army involvement, heavy casualties on the Indian side and essentially nothing to lose — at worst they would have to fall back behind the Line of Control. At best — capture more square miles of territory and cut Siachen off. 

While the Western and Northern fronts are alarming in itself, India faces an altogether different proposition while combating China. India faces fifth generation combat — a combination of soft and hard power. A new corps, frozen or not, is not going to lead to any gains if India’s defence establishment and national policy making institutions continue to exist in silos. 

“Tawang must not fall”, clearly does not cut it anymore.

[What I learnt bootstrapping my startup from Thailand for six months](http://levels.io/bootstrapping-startup-thailand/)

Every competitive advantage that he states for Thailand can be had in India, with a little effort


- Purchasing power of western currencies

- Comfortable accomodation for cheap

- Cheap food and domestic services

- Available domestic skill pool

Yet, no foreigners come here to innovate, there is virtually no industry which imports foreign skill which is willing to work here. I don't even need to spell out the advantages everyone will have with this. On the contrary, skill is leaving the country in hordes.

Instead, what we have is the following:

- FII. Good but not so useful. Basically speculative and arbitrage hungry flow of money. Provides some liquidity and credit, but short term and fair-weather.

- FDI. Good, but at the present there are policy bottlenecks and I see only limited scope of technology and skill transfer.

- SEZ. Mindless re-implementation of Chinese model. Whereas you can count the Chinese ones in your fingers there are more than 300 pipelined in India. None of these has come to much fruition.

- IT parks/Biotech Parks, etc. Tied to universities, have failed to attract a lot of attention from my perspective. (Edit: to explain, I think most Indian universities are substandard compared even lower middle US universities.)

- BPOs. Ok but not really the stuff that builds the backbone of an economy.



I think instead of going for zonal tax/industry enclosures, we should concentrate on building sufficient infrastructure to attract and recall lost talent. 

If our villages have pucca roads, working electricity, plumbing, effective Law and Order, and a few shops and good connectivity to urban centres, we can also declog our cities. 

I am sure many people would be willing to move out of our shitholes, breathe clean air and have large spacious open spaces to roam around and live nicely with their families in. 

The only reason I don't move to a peaceful clean air village

- Afraid that local goons would rob my house and kill my family

- No assurance of water, electricity, internet

- Shitty PHCs with unwilling or absentee doctors and untrained staff

- Shitty schools where my future children would have not future.

- Shitty roads, have to make a back breaking ride to the city for supplies, etc.


So how can we declog our cities to make a better country?",5

HOW? Suppose:

| AAP |         33|   6%| performs a near-miracle   
| OTHER   |   60| 11% |  CONGRESS-friendly, pseudo-secular parties 
    
WHO DO YOU THINK WILL FORM THE GOVERNMENT - UPA or NDA? Who DO YOU THINK WILL AAP support??? Do you still have a doubt? 

Why Mr. Kejriwal is not acting on his own allegations. Before elections he shouted 

>""Sheila Dixit chor hain, woh power companies se mili hui hai woh paani mafia se mili hui hai, inko to jail mein hona chahiye"".

>Congress is ruled by the *mafia*.

>From today, the people are entering politics - corrupt leaders, count your days

After he is elected as the CM of Delhi, with the help of Congress people, the same corrupt people who he was protesting against, he is not uttering a word about initiating investigations against CONGRESS leaders??? Not taking name of a *single* Congress leader indulged in act of corruption. In view of this any common men, will feel like this only. 

**The proof of pudding is in the eating!**

Why did Kejriwal defend the **muslim fanatic Tauqeer raza** who placed a bounty on the head of Taslima Nasreen, a progressive writer, and is baying for *EXTRA-JUDICIAL* violence against her? Where is Kejriwal’s morality or even a sense of propriety?
 
Why is AAP categorically against Nuclear energy??

On one hand they talk about ending corruption BUT on the other hand they BRAZENLY ACCEPT support from a **thoroughly** Corrupt party in India today i.e.Congress. That's why I say, 


Thanks to AAP, it seems, the odds of another UPA-rule have been *revitalized*, the AAP has rejuvenated a *dying snake*. They will return the favour to Congress if given a chance. *Everybody wins!* 

**Except** for the Nation and those hapless poor people who trusted Arvind Kejriwal and got *stabbed in the eye* by AAP. I never believed the maxim that said, ""lust for Power changes one in unique and unimaginable ways"", it seems, Arvind Kejriwal's sordid betrayal of public trust is *a quintessential example* of that. 

And once they WIN, form a coalition Government ***(UPA 3)***, Nation will witness, more of the VOTE-BANK politics and *subsidy-tricks* till the back of Indian economy is **completely broken**.

>Bring NaMo to power and save the Nation from complete disintegration,

3. If you live in a dream-world of your own, and think AAP and others without CONGRESS or BJP support can form a coalition of their own and prove a MAJORITY, I say let's play it out logically, suppose they did miraculously form a Government, *then* what? 

 # There will be a *policy-paralysis* to the hilt, rampant leg-pulling, *blackmails* basing on threats of pulling out support. *Anarchy*! We don't want that.
 
 # I am mighty **disgusted** that AAP IS acting like just another front of the CONGRESS. Plus, having two slots *reserved* for the *same* nexus (AAP, CONG and Co.) in the ballot is a big time enhancement of the probability of a win for that coalition/nexus/party if they can keep the collusion clandestine by misguiding public with *charades of mutual antipathy*. That is what is going on. I am really, really **scared** for India's future. 

Kejriwal is really a **duplicitous** fellow, his actions are proving he is a **typical opportunist**, he and his entourages will say **whatever pleases the public** and appear as a ""Man of the people"" but covertly the Government will not do *anything*. Seems like he has learnt from the best, Congress.

Delhi Power Supply : A new drama brewing between AAP and LG.,17,3cixtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3cixtv/delhi_power_supply_a_new_drama_brewing_between/,5,1436368634.0,"Delhi Power sector as it exists now is one of the most reformed model existing in the country, only other places more or similar reformed are Orissa and Gujarat. Govt directly can impact minimum rules, other than to intervene through subsidy. In order to make sustainable difference , Delhi govt shall require to go inside the existing rules and see where the nuts and bolts are creaking. 


**Understanding DERC's [role](http://www.derc.gov.in/AboutUS/FunctionsDERC/FunctionDERC.html) and composition:**
It is basically a court of Delhi's power sector. Once the judge is appointed, decisions are like judgments. You can appeal but you cannot disobey or they will call you anarchist. This court decides whether a change in electricity prices is needed or not. Nobody can legally reduce or increase any charge applicable on any part of Delhi's power, once it is decided by DERC. If anyone wants and gives any relaxation, without following this 'court', the only way is to announce subsidy, which means there is no actual reduction, but govt as a ruler decides to compensate to seller so that cost is not taken from consumer like us. Most inefficient way, but in short 1 day match type govt of AAP last time, this was precisely what happened. This will not work in present scene simply because of the fact that sustaining cash outflow for 5 years is impossible without sacrificing other important needs of people.

By spirit of the law, DERCs are supposed to be appointed by respective state Govt and includes minimum a chairman and 2 supporting directors well versed in energy policy and public policy laws, but across India what is happening is contrary to this. IAS with no specialized domain expertise preside over energy matters. DERC is responsible for performing due diligence/cross check on all claims of costs incurred on any expense which forms the basis of power tariffs to be approved. This indicates that DERC should have a strong staff with independent understanding of energy and policy issues, however in most of the offices, there is meager staff hired on annual basis contractually of 3 or 4 people. It may be noted that expense details for 1 company may easily run into 100s of pages. Thus consultant appointment forms an integral part of process and it is one of the many cracks which needs to be fixed for conflict of interest. 



**So, lets see what happens when BSES wants to raise our power bills.**

* BSES will prepare a report which is called 'petition'. This petition will explain the rationale, include calculations and arrive at conclusion of desired   result that is expenses proved. DERC accepts it for hearing and a date of hearing is given with notice for all interested stakeholders at website. 
Meanwhile DERC is supposed to internally study the documents, check its authenticity, request more information if provided information is insufficient,   all with the motive of ensuring that corruption do not impacts consumers and genuine costs are not denied. That is almost all process of CAG is required to   be done, except the fact that because of inherent shortcoming in DERC all this process is done by consultant. Consultant which is very often involved in conflict of   interest with some other private player in some other state.

* All other stakeholders are also invited with their comments and objections and proofs. It may be noted that none of the stakeholder other than DERC has exclusive   rights to seek additional information and documents to cross verify claims, hence all other objections are expected to be weaker. Anyway, on the day of hearing all objections are heard along with counter justifications and like in any court, decision is made. 

* On the day of judgement, DERC chairman and members approve or disapprove requests of BSES on the basis of their own wisdom and weight of objections of other   stakeholders.  


   
* The present process is such that govt is in very comfortable and standby position assuming that market mechanism is functioning smoothly (which is obviously a wrong assumption). But despite shortcoming of the system, almost none of the past state govt took initiatives of making it their task to present their case. 

* If we review above process, we will see that this system has lot of built in scope for conflict of interest, weakening of regulator scrutiny process and of course lot of chances of corrupt practices of gold plating being passed as genuine expenses to consumers. 

* Above process repeats every time any new power plant comes with its tariff approval, or BSES seeks approval of tariff rise because of extra money invested by company or due to so called losses or high power purchase costs. Finer point to see is that because of diluted due diligence capabilities, corruption costs get approved alongwith all proposals.


* While CAG audit is a welcome measure, but if we look at state of things (as in above proceedings) it is clear that CAG audit will be one time measure. It is crucial that AAP govt immediately refreshes DERC, strengthens its staff to an extent that no outsourcing to consultants is required and makes it mandatory to present itself (that is govt) as stakeholder and seek details of expenses.

Not just for the economy of our country but also for us as individuals.  Personal finance, in very simple words, is the management of *your own* Monetary resources. . And although it may seem like a term that is thrown around a lot only recently, your parents and grandparents, etc have, in fact, practised it in some form too. For example: If you send money to your parents every month, that is a return on their investment in you. If you've seen your parents set aside a part of their money every month to pay for bills and fees, that is budgeting. In fact, all monetary decisions that they've taken in their lives, as a family, come under the subject matter of personal finance.


So, just like we try and focus on our physical, mental and spiritual health, focusing on developing our financial health is important too and hence, matters of personal finance and investing your time in understanding it is of significance to EVERYBODY who draws a salary or earns an income from a business/profession.


Although we, at /r/IndiaInvestments do try our best to address your queries on the matters of personal finance too, but [the person we have coming over](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/2l56m0/upcoming_ama_manish_chauhan_founder_of/) has been in the financial advisory business for quite a while and his blog and books are of quite a lot of repute for their resourcefulness to not just other financial advisers, but also for people who are trying to improve their personal financial health.


Now, **if you're wondering how you could capitalize on this AMA**, ask yourself if you've ever had any of the following questions in mind at some point of time in your life: 


* I (or somebody I know) have had bad experiences with the stock market, Or, I don't understand any of it so I'd rather stay away. What am I missing?



* I can see that a particular stock/scheme has been doing well for the past few months, should I go All-in?


* I have surplus savings. Should I repay my home loan or invest it elsewhere?


* Planning to quit my job and start out on my own, How do I decide if I can afford to quit?


* What is the best way to deal with the bonus that I just received?


* We are expecting a child and would like to see the child get the best kind of education. What can I do starting today towards that?


* I've always wanted to visit Japan, but ever since I started working, something or the other comes up and I barely have enough money to even think about it. What do I do?


* Mutual Fund ratings and stock broker recommendations. How much of these should I trust?


* I have bought an endowment/ULIP insurance plan recently. Can I feel confident that my family is secured?


* What is the difference between a Life Insurance policy, Health insurance policy and a Personal Accident cover? Do I need these?


* I just saw this advertisement about an IPO. All my friends are investing in it. Should I?


* I am an NRI. I hear that the interest rates on fixed deposits are upto 9%-10% in India. Should I send my money to invest in India?


* I am an NRI and I expect the rupee to get stronger. Should I convert all my savings now?


* It's tax declaration time and I am looking for tax savings product. What do I do?


* What happens if I don't file my Income Tax returns?


* A friend/relative of mine suggests that I put in money in a certain stock or scheme or business venture. What are the points that I need to keep in mind before I take a plunge?


* I have a CA friend who helps me file taxes every year. Do I still need a financial planner?


* Are financial planners only for the rich? 


* How do I evaluate a financial planner?


* A portion of my salary goes towards EPF, does that mean I'll have enough money when I retire?


* Besides extra penalty interest, what's the worse that can happen if I don't pay my credit card bills?


*Note: These questions are in no way comprehensive and will not be asked by us. These are instead aimed at activating that part of your mind that thinks about this stuff.*

CMV: Eastern India and especially Bihar should be declared an Independent country.,0,49d7wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/49d7wd/cmv_eastern_india_and_especially_bihar_should_be/,8,1457394794.0,"Unity is good until it leads to inefficiencies and discrimination. Indian government is an inefficient government because of diversity in terms of culture and economies over which it rules. Often behind the grab of unity, certain members of unions are oppressed just like in a joint family. At that point it becomes important to question the rational behind union and it's continued existence.

I believe Bihar, the state from which i belong, should be granted the status of an independent nation. I think other Eastern states like Jharkhand, Orissa, and Bengal should be granted the same status and if possible those should form a new country with Kolkata as their capital.

Here are my broad reasons for Independence of Bihar. The list like any list is obviously inexhaustive:

1. Deliberate central policies to hurt economic prospects of Bihar: We all know the story of freight equalization policy that was used by GoI to steal the mineral wealth of Bihar and larger eastern India. Under this policy the transportation cost of selected minerals was subsidized by the central government which meant that any mineral included in this list will be available at the same price anywhere in India. The natural location advantage enjoyed by Eastern States was thus denied and the industries went to coastal regions of west and south. Had this policy not been in place many industries would have set-up their factories in Eastern India. Interestingly minerals that are found in western or southern India like oil from Mumbai-high were conveniently excluded from this list. Talk about double whammy. According to one estimate, Bihar lost Rs 1,12,812 crore just through the freight-equalization of steel alone. In the name of curing 'regional imbalance' and fostering 'equality' south-Indian industrialist and then finance minister T T Krishnamachari enacted this policy. The same notion of equality that was once used to discriminate against Biharis is now invoked to deny Bihar the special status. One wonders how little has changed both in terms of rhetoric and intention in all these years.

2. Differential and discriminatory public spending allocation for Bihar to impede it's growth: Anyone even vaguely familiar with policy-science would recognize the positive role played by government spending in region's macroeconomy. When we compare planned allocation for Bihar with the developed states such as Punjab,
Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra, it becomes clear that Bihar has been
systematically deprived of funds. Gujarat, Maharashtra and Haryana received per capita allocation of more than double that of Bihar during the entire plan period. **Thus we see Bihar was not poor it was made poor and it was kept poor.**

3. State-sponsored violence against Biharis: People from Bihar are routinely targeted outside of Bihar by members of ruling party, opposition and general public. Instrument of law-enforcement is used to extort money from them and their vulnerability in alien-country is exploited to deny them their proper wages. Often drugs and other dangerous substances are used to make them work longer hour. All this goes with the help of  silent and active consent of respective states. 

4. Historical, cultural, linguistic, religious and other reasons: Bihar and other eastern regions have always been independent nations of their own. Even when it included other regions,  sovereignty flowed from Bihar and not the other way round . Present union thus by and large has no precedence in history. Culturally Bihar and let's say Gujarat are as similar as day and night. In the same vain Bihar's unique linguistic, cultural and religious heritage that have only been mocked till now today face complete annihilation. Some Biharis have even been made to think that Bihar is somehow burden to India when in fact the reality is completely reverse.

India thus we see is an unequal, imperfect and unjust union where Bihar has everything to lose and has already lost a lot and nothing to gain. I think it should be terminated immediately for the good of everyone involved.

My choices as I see them or how to get screwed and have fun arguing about.,4,22wkuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/22wkuy/my_choices_as_i_see_them_or_how_to_get_screwed/,34,1397393466.0,"Congress:


- Ruling government that has done nothing to improve society or economy. Any increase in liberty can be attributed to the masses, not policies.
- Corruption has directly lead to millions staying in poverty due to lower growth rate
- 1984 sikh riots accused from the congress not only roam freely but remain in power
- Extremely divisive in promising sops based on religion and caste. I utterly and absolutely hate this aspect. I want a uniform civil code biased towards absolutely no one.
- Socialist economic policies will ruin India if kept in power.
- Has not proven good for women.
- Any progress to be attributed to the ""despite the government"" phrase.
- For anyone who quotes Godhra, I will remind you of this governments aparthy that has lead to countless suicides due to poverty driven by corruption. Their ministers have become fat cats on the flesh of our people, I will never forgive such apathy.


  
 


BJP:


- Part religous conservative, part social conservative and part fiscal conservative
- The religious conservative part is scary. Regressive outlook, some behave like the 15th century was better.
- Likely will not prove to be good for women.
- Likely will strive for uniform civil code but will towards hindus.
- Small but very distinct possibility that they will disrupt muslim society in India. (Small because the federal government does not have the control of a state government over local politics)
-Very distinct probability of causing religious unrest.
- My one positive for the BJP, the economic policies they claim to support are exactly what (I believe) are desperately needed for India. Pro-business, less government, less bureaucracy.
- While NaMo has proven to be a effective leader (good or bad) it has been with an iron grip on the state parliament. He has shown zero ability to co-operate, a must in coalition politics.
- If they had Sushma Swaraj or Arun Jaitley as a PM candidate they would have had my vote in a minute.
- Some reason for hope an educated hindu like me (for a better personal life) and likely much less worse than the Congress but still not good enough overall. 



  
  
AAP:


- Progressive ideals but very regressive ideas
- effectively communists in their policy, take from the rich to give to the poor. Which is fine to an extent but these guys may wealth seem evil.
- superficial secularism. AK dons the skullcap and aligns with conservative religious leaders as it pleases him
- I'm sufficiently convinced that there is a congress game behind them to divide the anti-congress, i.e. BJP vote.(not completely convinced)
- their leaders have already proven the old adage, power corrupts.
- India needs economic growth driven by policy at the federal level. It also needs quality local government that is an enabler. These guys should be heading every local government where administration is key. Their policy ideas are just horrible.

  
  
The rest

- fucked up. 



All in all to me this election feels like I've been stripped naked, bent over and made to repeat (like Animal House)  - ""Thank you sir, may I have another?""

[RANT] Kasuri book launch in Mumbai.,3,3ogbj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ogbj7/rant_kasuri_book_launch_in_mumbai/,8,1444687677.0,"So an ex- Pak minister is launching his book in India and all these so called 'liberals' are supporting this without giving a thought to the hundred's who have died as a result of Pakistani sponsored terrorism. The most common argument against people opposing Pakistanis in IPL or Bollywood was that civilians aren't responsible for what the government does. But why shouldn't a Pakistani minster be held responsible for the the acts commited by the government? He's talking about peace between the two countries right now and how people shouldn't die, etc. But he also happens to be same person who met up with Hurriyats in 2007 and invited people like Yasin Malik and other separatists ( wap.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/kasuri-to-meet-kashmiri-separatists-107022201115_1.html). Why is it so important for the left wing and other 'liberals' to pursue better relationship with an enemy state that takes pride in their policy of 'bleed through a thousand cuts' and sends state sponsored terrorists into Kashmir who kill our security personnel? I somehow feel that the Indian left wing doesn't give a fuck about the country at all. All it cares about is opportunities to show the right wing in a bad light. Same thing happened when the Indian coast guard blew up a Pakistani boat which was in Indian waters. The left wing somehow forgot that it was the 'Indian' coast guard and gave the benefit of doubt to the Pakistani smugglers(?).

1.) Have you been made aware of the open defecation costs to yourself and society?

2.) Has the awareness/pressure to stop increased in the recent years?

3.) What would incentize you to stop doing it?

4.) Who is driving the efforts in your area?  Is it Swach Bharat from the Centre?  State or Local authorities?  NGO's?

5.) How many people would you estimate (among your peers) don't have access to a toilet due to lack of money (as opposed to open defecating as a personal preference)?

On the one hand, the national party executive endorsed socialist principles of state ownership, regulation and control over key sectors of the economy in order to improve productivity and at the same time curb economic concentration. On the other hand, the national Congress government pursued liberal economic policies and incentives to private investment that was justified in terms of the sole criterion of achieving maximum increase in production. “ — Francine Frankel

Instead of moving towards mixed economy welfare states like Western Europe or Scandinavia, why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?

Why do we want leaders like Narendra Modi to be like Ronald Regan or Hitler ? Wouldn't Franklin D Roosevelt be a better role model ? FDR took America out of one of the worst financial meltdowns in American history.

Is it just an overextension after years of misrule under the Congress party ? I don't want to believe that Indians are inherently more selfish than everybody else.

I think a bloated bureaucratic license raj is as bad as a business oligarchy like Russia or any of the South American countries. Why do people want to move from one corrupt system to another ?

Now here is something which has been brewing in my head for some time, and I need to get this out in the open.

We All.

I hate the place we are at this moment of time. Illitracy, wealth disparity, exploitation, slavery are eating through the sole of humanity. We are a high tech civilization, which cannot guarantee equal access to the people which built it. On one hand we plan reusable rockets and space tethers, and on the other hand, Boko Haram is raping our children. We are witnessing exponential developments in science when the antigod of religion is turning humans into demons.

I could never understand the point of this cosmic accident. What are we here for? To kill each other in the name of petty, hypothetical beliefs? To selfishly enjoy the material comforts. To dwell in the past glorifing the deeds of our ancestors. I dont know. I just know that the way thing are going, is wrong, even by the lowest moral standards. Whose responsiblity is it? Who answers for this, misplaced suffering? Most people I know, don't care. In the age of the Social Network and instant communications, people don't want to let the cries of fellow humans spoil their profile. It's as if we have forgotten our oneness. Money and the constant run to feed our own is making us ignore the shrill noise of our own cries.

The Third world.

I am from India. Its a strange country. Naked children sleep on pavements of private schools. Women get raped, rightious are shot and the country sleeps a satisfied sleep every night. I know things are similar in the whole subcontinent. Millions of children are born daily whithout a roof on their heads, while houses lay empty waiting for a buyer. I see talented and intelligent people running for jobs and useless rich guys roaming around killing people on the foot path. I see myself running behind a lifestyle which I know, wont bring me any more comfort or growth than I already enjoy.

My brothers and sisters accross the border in Pakistan are in similar plight. Schools are being bombed and inoccents are murdered. I hear that the crime rate is very high and educational facelities just as low. A guy I talked to once spoke of losing hope and trying to go west, just like people here. Over in Bangladesh american garment companies I heard, are putting people into wage labour with life qualities comparable to boiler chickens. Iraq and Afganistan are torn apart and “Bombed back to stone age” as the vain pigs say.

I see us laughing on each other. Atleat we are better off than them, we say. What we know and dont appreciate is that accross all thoes borders and inside thoes burning houses live ony people. Like you and me. People who are agitated by deaths of their children. People who are uncomfortable about their future. People like you who have been denied choice. We forget that we are one in our sorrow.

The West.

Now theres these contaries which claim to be the light bearers of humanities future. They give out awards to our people for exeptional work in peace and simultaneously attack us with wepons having fancy names. They come smiling in formidable jets and bulletproof cars to rob us our sovirgin rights. These people give scholarships to our brilliant as if in charity and seduce them with money they got aplenty. Buying into the souls of our leaders they have impaled our dreams. When I see wars fought just to get our resources my soul cries. Every news of bombings, resulting directly from the bloody ploughs of western war economy reaping gold, where we seeded life kills my hope.

They ruled our lands for centuries. Killed our people, and raped our land for their use. They deprived our children of the basic needs. Enslaved us with state policies calling us indians. I say we should forgive them for the sins of their ancestors. Its best forget how the best of our people fought them for food, land and the right to freedom and how they lost their lifes and potentials for asking what was rightfully ours.The past can't be reclaimed, but the present may not be forgiven.

The Change we need.

We think in groups, religions, countaries, classes and races. They may be important but the most the most important indentity is our being human. It is the identity which binds us together in our pursuit of the unknown. Strength is in unity they say, and there are eight billion of us out here. Just thinking of what all thoes unique minds can accompalish when provided with the tools and mediums we have developed over the years is exeptionally hopefull.

Technology deprivaion disables people. I dont know how to do it, sadly. Most answers to this question are vague and inaccurate but, we need to make our technological innovations accesible. Capital is the main problem here. But, who knows something may be worked out sooner or later.

Public opinion is powerfull, but an educated public can be the true force of change. We need to devise a way to cheaply and efficiently teach our children. They are our responsibility, all of them because we got here first. Educating the people around you can alone solve most of the problems we have. If you cant teach yourself, donate to organisations. Help someone with their tution fees. Give them a chance at the future.

Vote for non confrontational governments if you can. War is a problem in itself. We should not let the west force this useless fight anymore. We should realise that are being taken for a ride here.

We sould work now to save the future.

Profit earned should be divided among land owners, investors and workers.",3,37ymdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/37ymdo/cmv_the_small_land_holdings_of_farmers_should_be/,4,1433111762.0,"On small land you can't use modern methods of farming. Most farmers are cash-starved, poor and often illiterate. They are faming because land is the only resource available to them and farming is the only skill however imperfect they have. The sector suffers from disguised unemployment where more people are working than actually required. Small farmers don't have enough liquidity to invest in modern tools and seeds. Every couple of year or so taxpayers have to rescue them from their bad loans.

This has to change. I believe it's time we take the lands of small farmers, collectivize it and handover it on contractual basis to big agri-corporates. These corporates would work for profit and their operations would be limited by healthy environmental practices. They will have the autonomy to decide what they want to farm. The profit earned by the corporates can then be divided among land-owners, workers and investors.

The economy of scale provided by big corporates, bigger landholding, better knowledge and physical infrastructure and standardization will bring new life to Indian agriculture. They will be easier to regulate and better at innovation.

Government should start enacting policies that should favor this line of development and incentivize farmers to collectivize their lands.",5
CMV: Bihar should leave Indian union and follow 'Nepal model'.,0,4gnfn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gnfn9/cmv_bihar_should_leave_indian_union_and_follow/,2,1461771183.0,"Bihar's union with India has failed to produce anything positive for Bihar. The great commanding heights of India's socio-economy is inaccessible to Biharis for many structural reasons. The political system set up by Lutyens with it's over-emphasis on consensus and it's inherent upper caste bias has failed to induce cooperation and solve 'collective action problem' in Bihar. 

On the eve of India's independence Bihar needed a dual revolution. An economic and another social. Social revolution in the form of significant land-distribution didn't happen^[1](http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1822/18220460.htm) . The government led by minority castes like Kayastha-Brahmin-Bhumihar led to more divide and rule policies. Caste rather than being eradicated got entrenched. And the economy too failed to take off. 

**By 'Nepal Model' i mean two things. First a restrained revolution and secondly a geo-political balancing.**

Bihar will compromise on it's own self-interest if it continues to be the part of Indian union when it is more lucrative for it to play Lutyens and Beijing against one another. Bihar has nothing to lose if it leaves the union because it has not gained anything either. By becoming the pawn of China it will at least do better.

By becoming independent, Bihar can first orchestrate a limited revolution like Nepal which will produce a more equitable land-distribution and which will bring a better coalition into power. A better coalition will lead to a form of governance which will make cooperation between different factions of Bihari society possible through a right mix of  ideological-institutional coercion and consensus . Secondly Bihar can play geopolitical balancing between China and Delhi which will be more rewarding than being completely aligned to either one of them.",5

As I said, Its nationwide power. I just can't trust someone with no proven abilities. One can at least give good governance in a state for a significant amount of time, then think ahead. 

It has already been shown by Goa, Gujarat etc states, that no matter the party in center, one can still give good governance in their own state. It is one thing to talk out loud about reforms, give hefty emotional speeches, and totally other to follow through.

AK gave lots of promises, tried to enforce them in 49 days. It would have been one thing, if he would have stayed there to see those policies in effect. All you can do in 49 days is to sign a bunch of papers which give subsidised electricity and water to all, but then its effects on the state economy are not seen in 49 days. They pumped up so much air in the pressure cooker, and when the whole thing was about to explode, they turned the gas off and opened the lid, claiming they cooked rice.

The choice of constituency says it all. First the national capital with at least a dozen camera's around him and then Amethi and Varanasi. Give all the BS reasons for that, but the attention seeking is just not deniable. Even Anna Hazare had Ralegan Siddhi to showcase so much as people will take him seriously. AK could at least have shown the prototype of his ideas over a small village, town, state then he would have had something concrete to talk abut and not base his whole agenda on criticising others. 

His promises are dreamy, that is why people want to believe them. You see, people genuinely feel that dreamy state can be a reality but a little introspection and deeper thought everyone realises that the claims are unproven, not even on a prototype level. Its practically not viable to entrust someone with such a big responsibility. 

Even Anushka Sharma in Band Baja Barat tried her hand at small scale marriages before jumping into a Sainik Farm big budget marriage. As of now AK is the Delhi Government that Failed. One who can not face his opposition in such a small state, dreams of central power, is he really that lopsided?",5

It gets the money from taxes (income tax, sales tax, VAT etc) and such strategic buffer pool which absorbs the money due to fluctuation in prices.

In response to this report, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has clarified that the total sanctioned strength of the PMO has been around 525 in the period 2011-14. As against this, the actual strength of the PMO in the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 was in the range of 407 to 411. The number has now declined to 385.

Also, against a sanctioned strength of 78, the PM’s personal staff in the period of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh from 1998-2014 consisted of 74 persons. The number in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal staff is 65, the PMO has pointed out.

The Business Standard report, which was based on an RTI reply provided on the PM's website, had wrongly interpreted the current personal staff strength of former prime ministers Singh, Vajpayee and Gowda as their staff strength when they were Prime Minister. According to the PMO statement, the current personal staff strength of the three former PMs is 14, 12 and 2, respectively.

* Indirect tax overhaul - Excise, VAT,Special Tax, Cess.... there are so many taxes everywhere leading to so much red tape. Keep rates same if you want but make it simple
* Relax business norms. Right now there are so many regulations and red-tape prone rules to even start a simple business. We rank among the lowest in the world when it comes to starting a business : FIX it
* FDI : Come with a clear cut policy. Flip flops hurt the economy
* Loopholes : Make it simple, and plug loopholes which currently allow businesses to exploit
* Subsidy : Our agriculture is languishing, so have meaningful subsidies instead of freebies which actually kickstart the farm sector, instead of freebies.

India - 2030. *An expectation*,0,4gphci,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gphci/india_2030_an_expectation/,1,1461805846.0,"To predict the future of a society, one should have a deep understanding with the grassroots and the elite simultaneously combined with deep intuition. Even as Complex a country as India, which is the manifestation of sheer diversity, A single man understood it, united it for a cause, and rallied it like never before in the human history. His name is Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Many less mortals who think they understood India and made decisions, policies and predictions which has impacted a painful effect on the country. Let me be one of them.


**The two arguments**

*The pessimist picture:*

The seeds for the partition of country are sown in the top notches of society by elite and educated of Aligarh Muslim University in late 1920’s. For some, it is desire for having a Islamic nation/Sharia bound society. For gullible others, it’s the paranoia of being underlings of hindus due the irrational fears stroked by jingoists. This eventually led to the most painful partition affecting the future of the world forever. How it affected, it’s not relevant to the context.

So, why bring the partition at all?  Because the early symptoms are showing up. 

As of now, the intellectual ecosystem of the country is heavily dominated by the left and elite. Even as irony hangs itself in shame, they like to call themselves as “libertarians” with Islamists as their brothers in arms. When a prominent historian  Irfan Habib equalizes a 7 million strong RSS with 30,000 strong Daesh- the murderous, rapist **cult**, the mutual admiration club *admires*. This ecosystem is very powerful, controls the narrative and thus every part of life.

During the partition the demographics are 20% Muslim. After bifurcation, the share of Muslims increases from 9.4% to 14.6%. A possibility of reaching the demographics of partition in near future is finite. What’s in a number? Huh!? This statistic doesn’t make sense. However, if we go into depth, it makes sense.
 
 [imgur](http://imgur.com/a/psR44)

The think-tank which conducted the survey has is widely respected. If the above survey is to be believed, it is likely that more than 85% of Muslims in India favor making sharia the official law in the country. It might be true; after all, sharia is the revealed word of the *only*  lord on how men should be governed according to Quran. The *desire*  to be ruled by the laws of god. Secular law is blasphemy ( I suggest you to study Quran to know more adjectives for kuffars). *Not ramzan, its Ramadan* - This might indicate wahabbisation of Indian Islam. However, early roots of pan-Islamism are from Khilafat movement. Another undeniable fact is the most enthusiastic supporters of Two nation theory during partition are Muslims of bihar and uttar pradesh.

Education changes little. If any, education can make man more dangerous. The reason ISIS has become such a threat is only due to education.

*Bharat ki barbadi tak jung chalegi*

*Bharat Tere Tukde Honge, InshaAllah InshaAllah*

These are the slogans in India’s top humanities university enthusiastically supported and spread by the left-Islamist nexus. In the past, when  an ecosystem with the network of madrassas called ‘Talibs’ are created with the purpose of brainwashing students, it overthrown a world super power.  We have a similar leftist ecosystem which brainwashes students making them troubled minds at the end of education. Now, the left ecosystem in India demands secession of:

•	Kashmir

•	Nagaland

•	Assam

•	Arunachal pradesh

•	Mizoram

•	Meghalaya

•	Tripura

•	Sikkim

•	South India (For reason of Hindi unknown person cannot be PM  so that a kannadiga can be the PM of  dravidanadu  :P )

•	Kerala
  


 [imgur1] (imgur.com/a/X0NRn)

Politics doesn’t seem to be any helpful. To fix political adversaries, they can make a terrorist real hero(Ishrat), even unban SIMI to stage terrorist activities,(to Invent saffron terrorism). Torture, suspend honest officers to make these lies true. Why care for national security, lives s long as they got the divide they needed?

 Some say that partition is inevitable. Triggered by Kashmir, It may include west bengal, east bihar and south assam. They argue similar symptoms are showing up.

***However***, There are some differences, this time, there are no pan-national Islam leaders as the need is satisfied by ‘secular’ parties. Even if Kashmir is seceded, in the age of heightened scrutiny, it is difficult to stage a jingoist Pan-national religious movements.

*The rosy picture:*

India is in a cusp of economic revolution. The traditional growth accelerates as constraints would be removed, Digitization of government services which nullifies most of corruption, citizen friendly governance and ease of doing business. The new age growth, having promise of unbelievable proportions is driven by Digitization and Internet Of Things.
	
 It is estimated by Centre for Economics and Business Research that by 2030, India would  be a 10 trillion dollar economy, constantly surpassing growth of china.  Indian government projects that per-capita income quadruples to 7,800 $ by 2032 pushing most out of poverty.
	
 The attention of politics have diverted significantly towards governance and development. Self-respect of the civilization is increasing due to high economic growth. Majority of Society is becoming liberal. More women are being educated and are adding upto high-end work force. With demographic boon, India can become a superpower and for sure, most populace nation. Due to education, all groups will become tolerant and liberal.

**Conlusion:**	
     
  So, what might happen? Both extremities are the arguments from a single person. As being optimist is necessity for one’s own good, I lean towards middle. There might not be Doom’s day scenario, but tensions might  increase. Altogether, a better society in most aspects. Increased materialism is a necessity for a civilization like India to be respectable. It helps poverty to root out. It gives education to everyone. However, basic aspects of our civilization which is built on frugality, mutual respect (it’s much better to tolerance) must not be forgotten for one’s own good and calmness of mind.",5
Let us talk - Subsidies and Sops,2,2vmgu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2vmgu8/let_us_talk_subsidies_and_sops/,3,1423747691.0,"I have seen a couple of posts actually go past shit flinging and low effort comments with some solid high quality discussion. In this vein, I thought we could have a weekly (or daily or whenever an important topic strikes somebody's mind) such discussion on the topics that matter.

The basic rules of these should be,

* The OP should make a reasonably detailed post stating his / her view.
* The other forum patrons should only stick to the topic and respond in a factual and objective manner. If it is a subjective response, please stay clear of low effort comments.
* The  topic could be on anything - defence, economics, politics, foreign policy, but the above rules should apply.
* Please keep political partisanship outside the discussion - yes, you might favour / support a party and it is not wrong to support it (or call it out if you don't), I mean the whole tu tu mein mein, but whatabout 2002 type or syphilis chacha type shitty comments.

Without much further ado,

Here is my take on Sops and Subsidies and why I have an issue with what the Congress used to offer and what AAP seems to be doing (THIS IS NOT AN ANTI AAP POST, SO PLEASE BEAR THAT IN MIND when you respond).

You have essentially (in order of ascendance and wealth / income)

Lumpenproleteriat (LP)- The poorest of the poor. They are the working class, but struggling to even make a living wage.
Proletariat - The working / labour classes
Petite Bourgeoisie - The lower middle class (clerks, entry level white collar workers), farmers, merchants etc
Bourgeoisie - Middle Class
Haute Bourgeoisie (HB) - The capital owning class (the rich fat cats) who employ the other social classes.
Now, India has roughly 30% who fall into the lumpenproleteriat (my base for this is the 300 Mn Indians who are on a near starvation level diet and 350 Mn who aren't connected to an electricity grid), maybe 50% proletariat and finally 20% who form the middle and upper income classes (base this on studies that put our middle class families at ~ 200-300 mn).

We need subsidies and tax benefits at two ends of the spectrum - the LP and the HB. LP because it is a means to their survival and a method by which they could hope to form the proleteriat. The proletariat need a measured subsidy program (maybe insurance schemes, maybe subsidized education). Now you might ask, why do we need to inventivise the HB? Because there are only two entities capable of generating millions of jobs a year (FWIW we need to generate 10Mn new jobs a year). One is the govt, and this is what Socialism is about and this is what schemes like the MNREGA are all about. The other are the HB.

You might DETEST Mukesh Ambani, but it employs at last cound ~ 50,000 people - multiply that by a factor of 4 (average family size of a typical white collar family) and you get 2,00,000 people DIRECTLY dependent on it. You throw in the Adani's, Jindal's, Tata's, Mittal's and the real estate barons, and a group of maybe 20, 30 of India's fat cats would employ 5 odd mn people (at the least) directly. This increases exponentially if you consider the medium enterprises.

We need to subsidise the HB because if we do that, we encourage their capital to invest in us, and by doing so we can generate jobs.

The issue I have / had with AAP's sops is that it is targeted at AAP's target base - the Petite Bourgeoisie and the Bourgeoisie. The Congress by comparision had good schemes for the lumpenproletariat such as the MNREGA but the execution was so messed up that it caused more problems than it solved.

Subsidies as a whole are not bad, especially in a country as poor as India, as long as it is targeted at the right segment, and loopholes are plugged. I don't support the two extreme views prevalent in India (both in MSM and social media),

* We need moar subsidies, more sops
* We need no subsidies, vive la laizzez faire.

We need to straddle the zone in between and target these subsidies where the economy can get a solid boost and take along the most marginalised with it.

TL;DR - Rajni is king.

Edit - Mods, it would be great if all these posts are flaired non-politics (even if it discusses politics) as quite a few of here might have set any politics flaired post on ignore and we will lose their insight. ",5

THE SATURDAY ESSAY Updated August 3, 2013, 4:46 a.m. ET
The $4 Million Teacher
South Korea's students rank among the best in the world, and its top teachers can make a fortune. Can the U.S. learn from this academic superpower?
By AMANDA RIPLEY
Kim Ki-hoon earns $4 million a year in South Korea, where he is known as a rock-star teacher—a combination of words not typically heard in the rest of the world. Mr. Kim has been teaching for over 20 years, all of them in the country's private, after-school tutoring academies, known as hagwons. Unlike most teachers across the globe, he is paid according to the demand for his skills—and he is in high demand.


SeongJoon Cho for The Wall Street Journal
Kim Ki-Hoon, who teaches in a private after-school academy, earns most of his money from students who watch his lectures online. 'The harder I work, the moreImake,' he says. 'I like that.'

Mr. Kim works about 60 hours a week teaching English, although he spends only three of those hours giving lectures. His classes are recorded on video, and the Internet has turned them into commodities, available for purchase online at the rate of $4 an hour. He spends most of his week responding to students' online requests for help, developing lesson plans and writing accompanying textbooks and workbooks (some 200 to date).

""The harder I work, the more I make,"" he says matter of factly. ""I like that.""

I traveled to South Korea to see what a free market for teaching talent looks like—one stop in a global tour to discover what the U.S. can learn from the world's other education superpowers. Thanks in part to such tutoring services, South Korea has dramatically improved its education system over the past several decades and now routinely outperforms the U.S. Sixty years ago, most South Koreans were illiterate; today, South Korean 15-year-olds rank No. 2 in the world in reading, behind Shanghai. The country now has a 93% high-school graduation rate, compared with 77% in the U.S.

Tutoring services are growing all over the globe, from Ireland to Hong Kong and even in suburban strip malls in California and New Jersey. Sometimes called shadow education systems, they mirror the mainstream system, offering after-hours classes in every subject—for a fee. But nowhere have they achieved the market penetration and sophistication of hagwons in South Korea, where private tutors now outnumber schoolteachers.

Viewed up close, this shadow system is both exciting and troubling. It promotes striving and innovation among students and teachers alike, and it has helped South Korea become an academic superpower. But it also creates a bidding war for education, delivering the best services to the richest families, to say nothing of its psychological toll on students. Under this system, students essentially go to school twice—once during the day and then again at night at the tutoring academies. It is a relentless grind.

The bulk of Mr. Kim's earnings come from the 150,000 kids who watch his lectures online each year. (Most are high-school students looking to boost their scores on South Korea's version of the SAT.) He is a brand name, with all the overhead that such prominence in the market entails. He employs 30 people to help him manage his teaching empire and runs a publishing company to produce his books.

To call this mere tutoring is to understate its scale and sophistication. Megastudy, the online hagwon that Mr. Kim works for, is listed on the South Korean stock exchange. (A Megastudy official confirmed Mr. Kim's annual earnings.) Nearly three of every four South Korean kids participate in the private market. In 2012, their parents spent more than $17 billion on these services. That is more than the $15 billion spent by Americans on videogames that year, according to the NPD Group, a research firm. The South Korean education market is so profitable that it attracts investments from firms like Goldman Sachs, the Carlyle Group and A.I.G.

It was thrilling to meet Mr. Kim—a teacher who earns the kind of money that professional athletes make in the U.S. An American with his ambition and abilities might have to become a banker or a lawyer, but in South Korea, he had become a teacher, and he was rich anyway.

The idea is seductive: Teaching well is hard, so why not make it lucrative? Even if American schools will never make teachers millionaires, there are lessons to be learned from this booming educational bazaar, lessons about how to motivate teachers, how to captivate parents and students and how to adapt to a changing world.

To find rock-star teachers like Mr. Kim, hagwon directors scour the Internet, reading parents' reviews and watching teachers' lectures. Competing hagwons routinely try to poach one another's celebrity tutors. ""The really good teachers are hard to retain—and hard to manage. You need to protect their egos,"" says Lee Chae-yun, who owns a chain of five hagwons in Seoul called Myungin Academy.

The most radical difference between traditional schools and hagwons is that students sign up for specific teachers, so the most respected teachers get the most students. Mr. Kim has about 120 live, in-person students per lecture, but a typical teacher's hagwon classes are much smaller. The Korean private market has reduced education to the one in-school variable that matters most: the teacher.

It is about as close to a pure meritocracy as it can be, and just as ruthless. In hagwons, teachers are free agents. They don't need to be certified. They don't have benefits or even a guaranteed base salary; their pay is based on their performance, and most of them work long hours and earn less than public school teachers.

Performance evaluations are typically based on how many students sign up for their classes, their students' test-score growth and satisfaction surveys given to students and parents. ""How passionate is the teacher?"" asks one hagwon's student survey—the results of which determine 60% of the instructor's evaluation. ""How well-prepared is the teacher?"" (In 2010, researchers funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation found classroom-level surveys like this to be surprisingly reliable and predictive of effective teaching in the U.S., yet the vast majority of our schools still don't use them.)

""Students are the customers,"" Ms. Lee says. To recruit students, hagwons advertise their results aggressively. They post their graduates' test scores and university acceptance figures online and outside their entrances on giant posters. It was startling to see such openness; in the U.S., despite our fetish for standardized testing, the results remain confusing and hard to interpret for parents.

Once students enroll, the hagwon embeds itself in families' lives. Parents get text messages when their children arrive at the academies each afternoon; then they get another message relaying students' progress. Two to three times a month, teachers call home with feedback. Every few months, the head of the hagwon telephones, too. In South Korea, if parents aren't engaged, that is considered a failure of the educators, not the family.

If tutors get low survey marks or attract too few students, they generally get placed on probation. Each year, Ms. Lee fires about 10% of her instructors. (By comparison, U.S. schools dismiss about 2% of public school teachers annually for poor performance.)

All of this pressure creates real incentives for teachers, at least according to the kids. In a 2010 survey of 6,600 students at 116 high schools conducted by the Korean Educational Development Institute, Korean teenagers gave their hagwon teachers higher scores across the board than their regular schoolteachers: Hagwon teachers were better prepared, more devoted to teaching and more respectful of students' opinions, the teenagers said. Interestingly, the hagwon teachers rated best of all when it came to treating all students fairly, regardless of the students' academic performance.

Private tutors are also more likely to experiment with new technology and nontraditional forms of teaching. In a 2009 book on the subject, University of Hong Kong professor Mark Bray urged officials to pay attention to the strengths of the shadow markets, in addition to the perils. ""Policy makers and planners should…ask why parents are willing to invest considerable sums of money to supplement the schooling received from the mainstream,"" he writes. ""At least in some cultures, the private tutors are more adventurous and client-oriented.""

But are students actually learning more in hagwons? That is a surprisingly hard question to answer. World-wide, the research is mixed, suggesting that the quality of after-school lessons matters more than the quantity. And price is at least loosely related to quality, which is precisely the problem. The most affluent kids can afford one-on-one tutoring with the most popular instructors, while others attend inferior hagwons with huge class sizes and less reliable instruction—or after-hours sessions offered free by their public schools. Eight out of 10 South Korean parents say they feel financial pressure from hagwon tuition costs. Still, most keep paying the fees, convinced that the more they pay, the more their children will learn.

For decades, the South Korean government has been trying to tame the country's private-education market. Politicians have imposed curfews and all manner of regulations on hagwons, even going so far as to ban them altogether during the 1980s, when the country was under military rule. Each time the hagwons have come back stronger.

""The only solution is to improve public education,"" says Mr. Kim, the millionaire teacher, echoing what the country's education minister and dozens of other Korean educators told me. If parents trusted the system, the theory goes, they wouldn't resort to paying high fees for extra tutoring.

To create such trust, Mr. Kim suggests paying public-school teachers significantly more money according to their performance—as hagwons do. Then the profession could attract the most skilled, accomplished candidates, and parents would know that the best teachers were the ones in their children's schools—not in the strip mall down the street.

Schools can also build trust by aggressively communicating with parents and students, the way businesses already do to great effect in the U.S. They could routinely survey students about their teachers—in ways designed to help teachers improve and not simply to demoralize them. Principals could make their results far more transparent, as hagwons do, and demand more rigorous work from students and parents at home in exchange. And teacher-training programs could become far more selective and serious, as they are in every high-performing education system in the world—injecting trust and prestige into the profession before a teacher even enters the classroom.

No country has all the answers. But in an information-driven global economy, a few truths are becoming universal: Children need to know how to think critically in math, reading and science; they must be driven; and they must learn how to adapt, since they will be doing it all their lives. These demands require that schools change, too—or the free market may do it for them.

Nature News: India orders premier labs to pay their own way,1,3s2f04,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3s2f04/nature_news_india_orders_premier_labs_to_pay/,0,1447055412.0,"Pasting the article since its behind a pay wall (edit: oops...Science, not Nature)

http://www.sciencemag.org/content/350/6261/617.full

> India's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has boosted the country's economy by fostering a booming generic drug industry and devising new approaches to hybrid crops. Now, the network of 38 national laboratories needs to nurture its own finances. The central government, intent on curbing domestic spending, feels CSIR's $600 million budget is a luxury it can no longer afford and has given the labs 2 to 3 years to “self-finance” half their expenditures by winning grants, licensing discoveries, and collaborating with industry.

> The ultimatum, issued quietly at a CSIR meeting in June, is the most dramatic sign of the funding squeeze now gripping science in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government insists it is not hostile to research: Rather, it wants R&D to better serve national interests. In addition to seeking their own funding, CSIR lab chiefs now must send reports to the government about how their centers serve flagship government programs such as schemes to build smart cities, clean the Ganges River, and promote sanitation. CSIR's newly appointed director general, Girish Sahni, says he is fully on board with the directive. “We don't always depend on our parents, do we?” he asks. “We live in challenging times, and this present government has posted these challenges on the bulletin board of the nation.”

> But the self-financing directive has riled many in India's scientific community. The CSIR labs “were founded to give know-how to Indian industry, and I agree that they should work on solving the country's problems,” says Shri Krishna Joshi, a former CSIR director general. “But I fail to understand how frontier R&D institutions can become self-supporting in 2 years, unless they take on routine jobs like testing, which technicians at third-rate labs usually get subcontracted to do.”

> Since Modi came to power 18 months ago, his government has increased overall spending, by 5.7% this year. But most of the rise went to infrastructure projects—building new highways and upgrading rail lines, for instance—to stimulate economic growth. Meanwhile, it has slashed spending on the environment and social welfare, including health. A study to be published in The Lancet next month warns of a “collapse” if the government continues its low levels of investment in public health, among the lowest in the world at 1.3% of gross domestic product. Most science agencies have barely kept pace with inflation. “I'm already working against all odds on a very low budget,” one medical researcher says. “Everyone I know is pissed beyond belief.”

> In science and technology, the sole winners are the Department of Atomic Energy, which is ramping up construction of nuclear reactors, and the Indian Space Research Organisation. Those champions reflect another Modi priority: indigenous innovation, at which India's nuclear and space communities excel thanks to years of coping with international sanctions imposed over the country's nuclear weapons program. Underscoring that, the government this week launched a $153 million program called IMPRINT to support projects, it said, “in areas where the country is heavily dependent on foreign technology.” Smart sensors, renewable energy, nanotechnology, and diagnostic imaging are priorities.

> Some scientists worry that the Modi government is not getting sound scientific advice. The prime minister disbanded a scientific advisory council that had served his predecessor. As a result, says C.N.R. Rao, a chemist who served as the previous government's chief scientific adviser, the government now lacks “capable people advising them on policy matters.”

> The government's moves put CSIR's very future at stake, some say, because the self-financing drive is doomed to fail. India doesn't have a funding ecosystem like that of the United States, where entrepreneurial scientists can seek venture capital and foundation support, says Sidharth Chopra, who studies antibiotic resistance at the Central Drug Research Institute in Lucknow, a CSIR-affiliated lab. “In India, there's nobody, not a single industrialist, who'll give you a dime,” he says.

> He thinks the government has its priorities wrong. “I'm a big [space] fan, don't get me wrong,” Chopra adds. “But the next time you have diarrhea, and don't have antibiotics that work, Mars will be the last thing on your mind.”

> Defending the CSIR directive, Harsh Vardhan, India's science minister, told The Hindu newspaper last week that the government hopes to hasten technology transfer from lab to industry, and to make labs more accountable. “There is no harm in relying on industry to scale up or take forward the research projects underway,” he said.

> Sahni, CSIR's director, says that researchers should quit griping and get with the program. “It's high time Indian scientists rose to the occasion, and not merely published papers to satisfy their natural curiosity,” he says, “but also got together, with their best ideas and technologies, to solve the nation's problems.”",5

[R] Goods and Services Tax,18,2ftrrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2ftrrf/r_goods_and_services_tax/,0,1410227590.0,"Original date of rollout: April 1, 2010

Contentious issues:

1)

* States: Demand for provision in constitution to compensate them for any losses they make under proposed tax regime.

* Reason: Past bad experience of compensation in central sales tax (cst) case.

* Cst case - UPA government said that compensation to states on account of cut in cst to be released only when states agree to rollout gst. 

* Outcome - NDA said dues of Rs. 34,000 crore to be given to state over period of 3 years.
* Problem: compensation is proposed for only 5 years. ""the constitution cannot be changed every now and then"". Besides, NDA confident that states would not make any loss under the gst as they would get to share revenue.

* Solution: Use of alternative legal framework that does not involve constitutional amendment. Possible that 14th finance commission may recommend mechanism.

2)

* States: Petroleum product to be kept out of gst.

* Reason: It comprises 26% of their revenue.

* Problem: a) It forms major input for all other industries. 

* b) Will result in cascading of taxes for all other sectors, increase in cost of production. 

* c) It will disrupt audit trail and cause revenue leakages.

* Solution: a) Include petroleum in gst but tax at rate of 0%.
* b) States continue to levy sales tax, value added tax on it.
* c) Centre retains right to impose excise duty.

3)

* States: Entry tax to be kept out of gst.
 
* Problem: a) Excluding so many taxes from gst will defeat purpose of making India a common market.

* b) Pushes up the revenue-neutral rate for government.

* Solution: States could levy additional state gst - within a band - to protect revenue.

[NP] Do boycotts really work?,1,33ckyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/33ckyn/np_do_boycotts_really_work/,2,1429649742.0,"Here's an excerpt of a boycott that worked...

But for really bloody histories, it’s hard to top the Middle East, and in few places are people so passionate about their food. And Israelis, God bless them, love cottage cheese. To me it’s gross and lumpy, but to them it’s essential. They gobble it up with scrambled eggs for breakfast and mix it into their salads for dinner. Yet by 2011 it was getting really expensive. Now, this wasn’t the only thing Israelis had noticed. For two decades, the formerly generous state had gone through a difficult process of privatization, and many social programs were cut. Tens of thousands of poor Israelis were scrambling to find apartments in an increasingly tight real estate market, which was controlled by a handful of powerful corporations eager to raze older buildings and replace them with shiny glass high-rises. But as anyone who’s dealt with a landlord can tell you, arguing for your right to an affordable rent is a hard battle to win. You’ll probably just be sent to Craigslist and told to look somewhere else. And in every city and state, you’ll always find lots of people who support gentrification and new development. So while less well-off Israelis tried to snag the scarce affordable housing they could find, plenty of other citizens did little but shrug and admire the sleek new buildings sprouting up all over the place. Even as the people seeking affordable apartments resented the new class of insanely wealthy, politically connected men and women who were enjoying a lifestyle of private planes and private clubs, most Israelis kept telling themselves that, compared to the rest of the world, life in Israel was still pretty good. They could afford to shop at Ikea every weekend, buy the latest flat-screen TVs, and take nice trips abroad. A few blowhards, the sort of humorless folks you’d politely try to ditch if you ever got stuck talking to one at a party, looked at all the new buildings and conspicuous consumption arising in Israeli society and cried out that a revolution was in order, that Israelis needed to get together and topple the system or, at the very least, the government. But nobody paid any attention. Just like us in Serbia, these grumpy Israelis had a clear vision of tomorrow that was based largely on their recent past. Even if nobody was listening, they still spoke about wanting to live in a country where a basic safety net existed to catch those who were down on their luck. They were still cool with the free market, and took pride in having created so many successful industries, particularly in high tech. What they hated—the term sprang up somewhere around 2010 and was soon on everyone’s lips—was “piggish capitalism.” For the most part, though, they had no idea how to stop it. This is where Itzik Alrov comes in. When Israelis think of their heroes, they imagine tanned and muscular warriors or beautiful models like Bar Rafaeli, not a scrawny ultra-Orthodox insurance salesmen who makes ends meet by moonlighting as a singer in local synagogues. But this Alrov was a thoughtful and passionate man. Like all the others, he didn’t like “piggish capitalism,” but he understood that for anything to change he needed to make the fight relevant to everyone, even those individuals who were relatively well-off. He knew that most people wouldn’t join an effort to do something that sounded really daunting, like forcing the prime minister to resign or coming up with an alternative economic program. He knew instinctively that when you have a vision of tomorrow, you can’t pick the big cataclysmic fight as your first confrontation. In the beginning, everybody is a nobody. And nobodies need to find the battles they can win. That’s why in all those movies Batman goes after common thugs in the first few scenes. He starts by picking easy fights, building a reputation and a name. Only then does he take on the Joker. No matter how important the big issues are to you, it’s imperative to start with something manageable. And in Israel, Alrov knew he couldn’t take on the entire economy right out of the gate. But he could do something about cottage cheese. Like all Israelis, he was crazy for the stuff. And like all Israelis, he knew its story only too well. Realizing that the cheese was a fundamental part of most people’s diet, the government had subsidized it as a staple, which meant that the price of one cup of cottage cheese couldn’t go above a predetermined price. It kept cottage cheese affordable. In 2006, however, the government changed its mind. As it had done with so many other industries and resources, it decided to let the market run its course, so it removed the subsidies. The minister of finance, a chubby guy with a beard who looked like a sketchy version of Santa Claus, addressed the policy in an interview where he jovially laughed the whole thing off. Israelis had no reason to worry, he said. With the cottage cheese market now open to competition, products were bound to improve. In a sense, he was right: within four years, scores of new cottage-cheese-based products flooded the market, from artisanal cottage cheese to cottage cheese blended with yogurt and other cheeses. What the minister forgot to tell the people was that losing the subsidy came at a price. From four shekels, or approximately one dollar, in 2006, the price of cottage cheese spiked to double that by the time Alrov was looking for ways to protest the cost of living. And it didn’t take him very long to realize that the uproar over cottage cheese was the perfect vehicle for change. Alrov created a modestly designed Facebook page, using a snapshot of a dollop of cottage cheese. He gave his new social network group an awkward name: “Cottage cheese is such a basic product and now it costs nearly 8 shekels. We won’t buy it for one month!!!” He advocated letting the cheese spoil on the shelves until prices were lowered. And in the apocalyptic language befitting a religious man, he opined that “if we don’t overcome our desire to buy cottage cheese, we will never succeed in making it affordable again.” At first, only thirty-two people, most of them friends of Alrov’s, joined his online petition. But Israel is a small country, and a local blogger, amused by the idea of a cottage cheese boycott, interviewed Alrov. The day after the interview ran, his petition had nine thousand signatures. The mainstream media soon reported for duty, reveling in the unlikely working-class hero who had fallen into their hands. Before too long, Alrov’s page had a hundred thousand followers, which in a country of only seven million people is a lot. Alrov had found an easy fight to pick, and since everybody wants to join a winning team, his following continued to grow. The three or four companies who control Israel’s dairy market did what big and powerful organizations—corporations, governments, dictators—always do. At first they ignored Alrov and his followers. As the cottage cheese protests gathered steam, Tnuva, the largest player in the market, announced a new product called Cottage Cheese Munchies, individually packaged tubes of cottage cheese with small compartments containing various toppings like fruit or chocolate chips. The new product, a Tnuva spokesman said in an official announcement, “allows Tnuva to further differentiate itself from its competitors, as it charges the consumer more money for its innovation.” It was a dumb statement, but in 2011 Tnuva felt so secure in its position of power that it didn’t worry about it too much. It was a mistake. Alrov realized that talking about cottage cheese was a cover for Israelis to talk about the economy, about injustice, and about national priorities. Most people don’t really understand how the economy works—my wife and my bank manager will tell you that’s very much the case for me as well—but everyone understands how infuriating it is when the one product you really can’t live without gets progressively more expensive for no good reason except the greed of a few companies. People didn’t want innovation; they wanted their cheap cheese. Moved by Alrov’s call, more Israelis took the plunge and gave up their beloved cottage cheese. Tnuva’s chairwoman sent a stern message through the press, saying she wouldn’t lower prices. In doing so, she gave the cottage cheese protest just what it needed: a villain. Enraged with Tnuva’s arrogance, Israelis vowed to punish the behemoth. They didn’t stop at cottage cheese: now chocolate milk—shoko, the national addiction of Israeli children—gazed longingly from supermarket refrigerators as previously loyal consumers sneered while passing it by. Smoothies went unsipped. Swiss cheese grew moldy. Around water coolers in offices all over Israel, people boasted about their commitment to go dairy-free. It was the world’s first case of politically motivated lactose intolerance. And it worked. Within two weeks, the large supermarket chains, panicking over a noticeable drop in profits, announced that they would place all cottage-cheese-related products on sale. Still, that only lowered the price so much; if consumers were to win the battle, Tnuva and the other dairy corporations had to bow down. Sensing the tremors, the milk mongers tried to play nice. Tnuva’s chief, sounding much more welcoming than before, released another statement; she said that while she regretted not being able to reduce the price of cottage cheese, she promised not to raise it again until the end of the year. Most pundits expected this gambit to work, but they were underestimating the resolve of the cheese-addled masses. Alrov and the scores of activists who joined him were now sensing that they could win. They were like sharks who smelled blood in the water, and they pressed on. Five days later, Tnuva announced that it was reducing the price to just under six shekels. The protestors still wouldn’t budge. For them, it was five shekels or bust. A few days later, victory was theirs. All of the dairy companies issued separate statements, each pledging low prices. Tnuva’s chairwoman, under the scrutiny of her disapproving board, announced her resignation. But the real victory of the cottage cheese protest wasn’t just the triumphant return of the now affordable dairy product to the tables of hundreds of thousands of Israelis. Watching Alrov and his followers, a small group of young and idealistic Israelis had a bit of an epiphany. Unlike Alrov, whose main concern was being able to feed his family, they were college students who had spent their adolescence advocating for a host of causes related to social justice. They lived in communes, marched in demonstrations, read rousing literature, and wrote insightful blog posts. And they’d gotten nowhere. But now people were getting a better idea of how these protest movements could coalesce into something that actually achieves victories. They saw the importance of starting small, and doing what the American writer and activist Jonathan Kozol advises: “Pick battles big enough to matter, but small enough to win.” By choosing such an easy target, Alrov gave them the missing piece of the puzzle. Now that they’d experienced a victory, people were emboldened and willing to pick bigger fights. Just a few weeks after the cottage cheese rebellion was won, these students too launched their own Facebook page, targeting the rising cost of housing. They invited people to join them in one of Tel Aviv’s loveliest, leafiest boulevards, bearing tents. Until they were given options they could afford, they argued, they would live in the street. While before the students were ignored, here were thousands of ordinary Israelis answering the call. If it worked for cottage cheese, went the thinking, why not for housing? Hundreds of thousands more showed up at a series of mass demonstrations. Like Tnuva, the government first ignored, then tried to deflect, then sought to appease, and finally capitulated. A committee was appointed, and many of its recommendations were signed into law. Because some random insurance salesman picked a fight over lumpy cheese, young Israelis were now much closer to achieving their seemingly impossible vision of tomorrow. A big part of a movement’s success will be determined by the battles it chooses to fight, and a lot of that has to do with how well it understands its opponent. 

TL;DR
The lesson is companies which have perishable goods are hit hardest when those things spoil. Milk, Cheese etc. 

If you bother about company X and issue N, then go hit at its perishables. ",5
"[Essay] From independence to liberalisation: a history of India's economy
",8,yff3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/yff3l/essay_from_independence_to_liberalisation_a/,5,1345327825.0,"A previous essay on Pre-Independence economy [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/u6m6n/why_is_india_poor_considering_its_rich_and/c4stnpk)

This is a long essay, guys. It spans a couple of comments below, as well.


###1. Social consensus: planning, government, industrialisation###

More or less all shades of political opinion in India had a broad consensus on the path that India's economic development should take. The emphasis was on planned, rapid economic development and modernisation. Industry was to be stimulated by a method of import substitution-led industrialisation, rapid growth and investment in basic capital goods industries and preventing the domination of foreign capital. Agriculture was to be modernised through land reforms and the abolition of zamindari, spreading irrigation and encouraging modern methods. Everyone accepted the central role of the state and planning in achieving these goals.
 
The basic reasons for a consensus on these lines was the state of the Indian economy under the British. India basically remained a colonial, agricultural economy. The elements of modernisation introduced by the British, such as railways, telegraphs, and modern financial institutions, all served the overall needs of the colonial framework. Indigenous Indian finance and industry only made a feeble start after the first World War, and grew in the protected conditions automatically created by the second World War. The aim of economic planning was meant to be to accumulate Indian capital, and the best way was to promote basic  or heavy industry, such as coal, power, iron and steel, machinery and so forth. The rapid development of these industries would automatically boost the growth of other industry and agriculture also.

Another important felt need was to free the country from excessive dependence on imports. As a classic colonial economy, India was heavily dependent on imports of finished goods, especially machinery and capital goods. In 1950, for example, nearly 90% of machine tools used in India were imported. Import substitution was seen as a method of boosting domestic industry, which would have a multiplier effect in the long run. 
So the basic consensus on economic development can broadly be summed up as: Central role of the state, rapid industrialisation with a focus on basic industry, import substitution and increase in agricultural output.
		
###2. Planning and industrial policy: 1948 and 1956###
	
The  first industrial policy resolution, in 1948, marked out the areas where the Central Government would intervene. Industries were grouped into four categories: 
i.  Industries to be government monopolies: arms, defence, atomic energy and railways
ii. Industries where new undertakings would be government monopolies: coal, iron and steel, aircraft, ship-building, etc.
iii. Industries where private sector would be planned and regulated: Machine tools, chemicals, fertilisers, automobiles, etc.
	
To give effect to this policy, an industrial licencing act was passed, which required every industry to obtain licences for new units or extensions, empowered the Government to prescribe prices, methods, and volumes of production, and nationalise industries if necessary. 

The planning commission was established in 1950, and the first five year plan came into effect from 1951-56. Two subsequent plans were formulated and implemented, from 1956 to 1965. The first plan assigned the highest priority to agriculture, which was especially badly hit by the Partition. It was reasonably succesful in meeting its goals, and the second plan attempted in 1956 had a reasonably stable economic atmosphere. The second plan, thus, emphasised on the growth of heavy and basic industries. 

This emphasis on industrial growth was also accompanied by an intensification of the role of the state. Parliament, in 1954, had resolved to introduce a socialist pattern of society. In practice, this meant, as the second plan states, that

>""Major decisions regarding production, distribution, consumption and investment—and in fact all significant socio-economic relationships—must be made by agencies informed by social purpose. The benefits of economic development must accrue more and more to the relatively less privileged classes of society, and there should be a progressive reduction of the concentration of incomes, wealth and economic power.""
	
The 2nd plan, as well as the industrial policy of 1956 reflected this ideal. More industries were to be exclusive government monopolies, and the objective of basic industries shifted from ""regulation and planning"", to a scenario where most enterprises would be progressively state-owned, but private industry was free to supplement the efforts of the public sector. Even those areas where the state would not itself set up industries had to submit to licensing and regulation, and fit into the framework of socio-economic policy. 
	
The first two plans were reasonably successful in meeting their goals. Overall (annual) GDP growth was 3.6% and 4% in the first two plans, as against a target of 2.1% and 4.5%. Industrial production nearly doubled, with production of machinery increasing nearly five-fold. Imports, especially of capital goods, fell to 43% of total investment. Agriculture grew at nearly 3% annually. Electricity production (143%), railway capacity(67%), road length(50%), all increased. Scientific institutes and laboratories were established in several fields, and the nuclear and space programmes were started. 
	
However, the seeds of the later restrictive Licence Raj were also laid in this period. Industrial licencing was used to achieve all kinds of objectives, such as balanced regional development, high employment, foreign exchange, and so on. The licences were also allotted on a first-come-first-serve basis, leading to the (familiar) problems of lobbying and corruption. Agriculture growth, while the highest seen in a century, could not keep pace with rapid population growth. 
	
###3. Shocks, rupee devaluation and responses###


1962-65 saw sharp changes to the Indian economy. Two successive wars, with China in 1962 and Pakistan in 1965, saw a sharp increase in defence expenditure, to nearly 25% of the budget. To make matters worse, the monsoon failed for two successive years in 1965 and 66. This caused a sharp increase in deficit spending, which also led to high inflation, and a jump in dependence on external aid, especially for food supplies. 

Politically, this was an unstable time as well. Jawaharlal Nehru was greatly weakened following the China War, and passed away in 1964. The next PM, Shastri, shepherded India through the Pakistan War, and then passed away in early 1966. Indira Gandhi was foisted into the PM's seat by the dominant Congress leadership, and this began a tussle between her and several Congress leaders. 

The US at the same time suspended foreign aid in reaction to the Indo-Pak war and India's stance on Vietnam. The severe foreign exchange crunch forced India to take loans from the WB and the IMF. The conditions imposed were that India should liberalise its trade and industry, devalue the rupee, and adopt a new agricultural strategy. Accordingly, in 1966,  the rupee was devalued, trade and industry controls were briefly relaxed, and a programme of Western agricultural assistance began. 

As you can imagine, a sudden reversal of India's policy, imposed by the West at a time of economic crisis, did not go down well with Indian opinion. The arm-twisting by the West reminded everyone of the bogeyman of imperialism and the dangers of foreign capital. In addition, the government sharply reduced expenditures, but retained high taxes, in order to pay off wartime debts. This intensified the economic depression. In these circumstances, as Indira Gandhi battled with the Congress leadership, she denounced the liberalisation as the cause of the current crisis and reverted to a heightened version of control and licensing in 1969. She called for a general election in 1970, and won a landslide victory on the back of Garibi Hatao and radical socialist policies.

"A very short history of Sonia’s India, by Ravi Shanker Kapoor",13,1ib1df,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ib1df/a_very_short_history_of_sonias_india_by_ravi/,1,1373876198.0,"The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government’s rule in the last nine years will be remembered for the rampant corruption it spawned, the perversity it showed in hurting the economy, and the monumental incompetence that became the regime’s hallmark. Against this backdrop, one is tempted to pin one’s hopes on 2014 when the general elections are due (or before that, which is possible). A close look at the situation will reveal that a fundamental change in the situation is unlikely, even if the inglorious rule of the UPA ends. For, the root cause of economic slowdown and political atrophy—the resurgence of doctrinaire Leftists—is unlikely to disappear in the foreseeable future. At any rate, the disappearance, or even diminished severity of the root cause, will not happen on its own.

Resurgence of the Left

At the heart of the problems related to the economy, polity, national security, and diplomacy is the comeback of ideologically hardened Leftists since the UPA came to power in 2004. By Leftists, I refer to not just the constituents of the Left Front but also the Left-leaning intellectuals and academics. The resurgence should be viewed in the proper historical setting.

The tumultuous events of the late 1980s and the early 1990s had left the Indian communists and their fellow travelers ideologically shattered and psychologically battered. The fall of the Berlin Wall and later of the Soviet Union, unraveling of Moscow’s client states in the Eastern Bloc, China’s embrace of capitalism in all but name—these events disoriented pinkish intellectuals. They could not pose a big challenge to former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao when he opened up the economy in 1991 and did away with some of the worst features of Nehruvian socialism. Not that they did not try, but they were too demoralized and badly discredited in the public eye to check the economic reforms Rao authored.

The reforms continued unabated even after Rao demitted office in 1996. Later regimes continued with liberalization; this was despite the fact that the Communist Party of India was part of two governments during 1996-98. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which ruled for six years (1998-2004), carried forward the reforms agenda, notwithstanding its Swadeshi rhetoric.

Economic reforms brought unprecedented prosperity, and it was not confined to the rich and middle class; according to official data, the percentage of people below poverty line came down from 36 to 26 between 1993-94 and 1999-2000 (Of course, these and other figures of poverty reduction are religiously challenged by Leftwing experts, but then these experts are often wrong, though never in doubt, as we shall see).

Doomsday projections belied

All the Leftist predictions about the ill-effects of economic reforms proved to be wrong. They said that Indian companies will be crushed or eaten up by multinational corporations (MNCs); actually many domestic corporations themselves became MNCs. Professional revolutionaries said that ‘cut-throat competition’ will spell doom for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs); but the MSME sector grew very fast after liberalization; its growth rate was usually more than the index of industrial production. It was claimed that the rich would become richer and the poor, poorer; the rich did become richer but the poor also gained from all-around growth and development. The Left’s apocalyptic assertions and weird theories consistently proved to be wrong, but there was no let-up in the creation of outlandishness.

The Left’s tenacity was matched only by the complacency of Big Business and the political class. In the early 2000s, it was frequently said at business conferences and other public forums that ‘reforms have become irreversible.’ The rants of the Left were tolerated as the fulminations of outdated radicals.

Many relics of the past, like public sector undertakings (PSUs) and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), were viewed as dinosaurs that would slowly but surely become extinct. Administration, the law and order situation, judicial processes, police functioning, national security, etc. were expected to improve gradually. Or so the productive sections of society, the middle class, and the responsible politicians thought.

Lutyen’s Delhi as Jurassic Park

But 2004 witnessed Lutyen’s Delhi transform into Jurassic Park, with red and pink tyrannosauruses trampling economic reforms, creating mechanisms to strangulate business, devising ways to augment public (read wasteful) expenditure, weakening fight against Maoist and jihadist terror, and playing havoc with diplomacy. Owing to the 13 years of reforms, however, the economy had acquired certain resilience which not only withstood the depredations of the communists (who supported the UPA regime from outside during 2004-08) and the National Advisory Council (NAC) but grew at a fast pace for the first four years. It needs to be mentioned that the NAC, headed by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, comprises professional radicals, green lobbyists, bleeding hearts, and some downright Luddites. What makes them really dangerous is the fact that they are Sonia’s handpicked advisers to shape public policy; and she is the de facto ruler of India.

Most of the time during UPA I, the communists and NAC fanatics planted landmines in the economy. Over the years, many have tripped on the landmines. The proposed food security legislation is one such landmine that, if the Bill is cleared by Parliament in its present form, would play havoc with the economy in the next few years.

But, instead of confronting the anti-business statists, many industrialists, politicians, and liberalizers have been pleading with Leftwing intellectuals to accept, or at least not oppose, economic reforms since 1991. Capitalism—or, at any rate, some aspects of it—can be beneficial for all sections of society, including workers and peasants. This is the sum and substance of the message of the Swaminathan Aiyars and the Gurcharan Dases to their “Leftist friends.” The latter, however, disdainfully rebuff such entreaties. The liberalizer proposes, the Leftist intellectual disposes.

But how does it matter? The Left has been politically isolated and electorally battered; it does not appear to be a big player in any possible political configuration in the foreseeable future. So, why seek sanction from the commies and fellow travelers? Why worry about them and their cantankerousness?

Marketplace of ideas

The cause of worry is that the Left’s influence is, and has always been, greatly disproportionate to its political strength. For the marketplace of ideas is curiously egalitarian in more than one sense of the word: first, social and economic equality attracts a huge premium; and, second, what matters in the public discourse is the ability of the participants to promote their ideas, not their political muscle. It’s a level-playing field.

Unfortunately, no effort was made by anybody—be it India Inc, sensible politicians, people with heightened consciousness—to offer a viable alternative to the Leftist ideology. Many commentators glibly talk about a Centre-Right ideology or the BJP evolving into a Centre-Right party, but nobody has spelt out either the content of such an ideology or the roadmap for the BJP. So, the grammar, phraseology, and rules of public discourse continue to be determined by the Left.

Hence the continued relevance and dominance of the Left in the intellectual arena. And hence the continued genuflection to NAC-types and pinkish public intellectuals. Food security? “Very good idea, but you see we don’t have the money right now.” Reservations in the private sector? “Ummm… it would be nice to have diversity, but there are problems in implementing it.” Mandatory corporate social responsibility spending? “Oh, yes, we are committed to the society. But the mandatory thing would be troublesome.” The partisans of liberalization have always been hiding behind the problems of implementation, always citing practical considerations, always avoiding the real issue, always beating about the bush. Never telling professional revolutionaries that their economy—their entire philosophy—is off the mark.

The liberalizers never had the moral courage to take on the Left. They couldn’t tell the pink radicals that all over the world, rich nations follow the capitalist path; and there has not been a single nation that has become prosperous by adopting socialism. Besides, rich nations are also the freest ones in the world. As Milton Friedman said, capitalism is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for political freedom. Further, faithful adherence to socialism leads to either manmade catastrophes (100 million dead in communist countries) or excessive controls in and arrested growth of the economy. One would have expected liberalizers to bombard NAC activists and other zealots with such facts. If you can’t convince them, crush them. But, unfortunately, that doesn’t happen. The liberalizers fear the consequences; the fear is not groundless, as the enemy is an immensely powerful coalition.

Argumentum ad hominem

In the last few years, an alliance of the idealist and the practitioner of realpolitik has come into being, a sort of politician-intellectual complex. The idealist keeps crying for expanding the role of the state—of course, for the sake of the poor—while the politician keeps reaping the benefits. Hence the relevance of the NAC. NAC fanatics and their lackeys keep nagging businessmen on one pretext or the other; they are forced to seek remedy; politicians offer the remedy—of course, at a price. It is a win-win situation for the intellectual-activist and the politician: the former derives the sadistic pleasure of teaching the capitalist a lesson for whom his hatred is pathological; the politician mints money.

The weapon of mass deception intellectual-activists use to devastating effect is argumentum ad hominem. Ad hominem is the form of argumentation in which the opponent-arguer rather than his argument is attacked. If somebody makes a case for, say, foreign direct investment (FDI) in a sector, the pros and cons of the case are not debated; the person promoting FDI is accused of working on some agenda. Similarly, the champions of economic reforms are maligned as stooges of big business, the skeptics of food security as anti-poor villains, the opponents of subsidies as heartless experts, the doubters about reservation as anti-Dalit, the advocates of stronger Indo-US ties as CIA agents, votaries of tough stand on terror is jingoists, and so on. The ad hominem attack is so vicious and concerted that the person forgets the main issue and starts defending himself or herself.

Argumentum ad hominem is considered a dishonorable method but it is very effective. Even in the US, it is used by Obama’s supporters to tarnish conservatives and libertarians: criticism of the president on policy matters is often misconstrued as a racist assault. In India, where there is hardly any Right-wing intellectual establishment, argumentum ad hominem is even more damaging.

India today

With the Left in ascendance and its discredited doctrines viewed as gospel truths, India has started sliding in every sphere, be it economy, polity, national security, or diplomacy. From the 8-9 per cent growth rate, we are facing the prospect of growth around, or even below, 5 per cent. The rupee is on a downward spiral; industry is down; services are also slowing; fiscal and current account deficits have become a headache; infrastructure development continues to face a myriad of bottlenecks; investors, domestic as well as overseas, are avoiding India; even state-run PSUs are unwilling to invest in India; long is the list of economic woes. The India Story has taken a tragic twist.

Politicians, especially from the ruling party, have lost all sense of propriety, national interest, internal security, or national defence. Notice the irresponsibility and cynicism with which they sought to gain mileage from the recent calamity in Uttarakhand; notice also the perversity with which the Congress is trying to play the Central Bureau of Investigation against the Intelligence Bureau. Power is not the means to give a concrete shape to their ideas, if they have any; it has become an end in itself, the summum bonum of political existence—an end to make money, to stay in power forever, to exercise it with aplomb.

Earlier, political parties kept foreign affairs out of their politicking. These days, however, nothing is inviolable. So, Mamata Banerjee impacts Indo-Bangladesh ties; DMK’S political calculations cast their shadow on India’s relations with Sri Lanka; when the communists were in the reckoning, China had to be dealt with kid gloves.

Petty politicking has also adversely affected military preparedness. After Bofors, maligning any arms deal has become easy. It’s not that everything is proper in such deals, but it is also a fact that vested interests also play a role. In the process, procurement has been badly hit. Typically, the government, whose obsession is about entitlements, is least bothered.

Just do it

Since the root cause is the unchallenged ascendance of the Left, the solution lies in posing a creditable challenge to it. Its intellectual constructs have to be destroyed; its falsehoods, ludicrous theories, and preposterous claims have to be exposed. It will not happen on its own; we have to do it.

Economic reforms happened in 1991 because of a quirk of fate, because of a fortuitous combination of circumstances. After Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination in May, big bosses in the Congress thought that Narasimha Rao, an old leader who was contemplating retirement, would be a pliable tool. Rao, however, proved to be a Chanakya in wisdom and wiliness. The rest, as the cliché goes, is history.

It is important to note that the 1991 liberalization was not the result of any efforts by the captains of industry, some Rightwing intellectual revolution, or sagacity on the part of the political class or even some sections of it. Unfortunately, reforms were never provided moral or philosophical justification. At best, the liberalizers argued that economic reforms would help the poor. But then efficiency is a poor justification for any policy framework, especially when the opponents incessantly castigate it.

[NP] Bahuguna's padyatras,0,2kjlss,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2kjlss/np_bahugunas_padyatras/,1,1414504315.0,"ECOLOGY IS PERMANENT ECONOMY: The Activism and Environmental Philosophy of Sunderlal Bahuguna by George Alfred James. SUNY Press, New York, 2013.

THIS timely book clearly and comprehensively captures the motivation, method and philosophy of the grassroots level environmentalist, Sunderlal Bahuguna, best known for his contribution to the ‘Chipko’ movement. The author, George James, discusses why this book is important in the introduction. ‘It is relevant to an understanding of environmental struggles everywhere’ (p. 1). I agree with his observation as environmental struggles the world over have primarily centred on conservation, distribution, justice and sustainability. Since Bahuguna’s own struggles touch on all these at some point or another, a recording of his contribution to the environmental movement is crucial. What makes the book additionally valuable is that while presenting a well researched objective account, it also records the protagonist’s own views.

The book mainly charts the course of Bahuguna’s environmental activism in the Western Himalayas in India. It also seeks to analyze his underlying philosophy. Bahuguna’s actions were influenced by Gandhian thought and the depth of this influence becomes clear on a reading of the book – there is constant reference to some Gandhian idea underlying his actions. According to James there were other influences too. ‘His [Bahuguna’s] environmental philosophy is rooted in the soil of Indian philosophy, informed by the insights of contemporary ecology, and inspired by the vision of Gandhi’ (p. 2). The implications of these influences are discussed in the final chapter.

This book is based on the author’s interviews with Bahuguna that began in 1998. James has a lucid, storytelling manner that he intersperses with explanations and analysis. He narrates his first encounter with Bahuguna: Bahuguna appears friendly and forthcoming and informs James that his entire philosophy can be summed up under three A’s (austerity, alternatives and afforestation) and five F’s (food, fodder, fuel, fertilizer and fibre, all related to trees). As one can well imagine, these are recurrent themes throughout the book.

The initial chapters describe Bahuguna’s childhood in Tehri and his early influences. Born in 1927, Bahuguna and his siblings were raised by their mother when their father died. His mother’s strenuous life seems to have left a lasting impression on Bahuguna, notes James, about the hard life of mountain women. Bahuguna’s tryst with the Gandhian, Sri Dev Suman, to whom he gave the status of guru, is then discussed. Sri Dev Suman introduced the young Bahuguna and his friends to the work of Gandhi and Kropotkin. The latter’s fiery writings, and Gandhi’s ideas of self-rule, non-violence and self-reliance impressed his young mind. It was for helping Sri Dev Suman, who was then in jail for protesting against the princely ruler of Tehri Garhwal, to publish (in the Hindustan Times) a copy of the statement he had made at his summary trial in jail that Bahuguna was arrested for the first time. Sri Dev Suman later died in jail while fasting for his causes. This news affected Bahuguna deeply. He was then all of seventeen and still in jail. But when Bahuguna was temporarily let out on medical grounds, he fled to Lahore and later to Lyllpur. He spent the years away from Tehri productively: reading and learning. James observes that he continued to read Gandhi and picked up the ideas of reconstructing communities from the grassroots and decentralization. He also took to spinning and scavenging, the latter a form of selfless practice suggested by Gandhi. Bahuguna returned to Tehri in 1947 at the age of nineteen.

James notes that Bahuguna had a short-lived career as an activist politician (Chapter 4). He was initially the publicity secretary for the local Praja Mandal (Citizens’ Forum) and later became its general secretary. He fasted for the first time in peaceful protest when the police wouldn’t let him enter his hometown in anticipation of trouble. The police eventually gave in and gave credence to this type of protest, one that he was to turn to several times in his life. As secretary of the Praja Mandal, Bahuguna worked against caste discrimination, and was instrumental in building a hostel for students facing discrimination. It was around this time that Bahuguna met Mira Behn. James spends the next chapter discussing this encounter as it was what, in Bahuguna’s belief, initiated his involvement with ecology. Mira Behn was an Englishwoman who had come to live and work with Gandhi. James introduces her life and environmental activism that came to influence Bahuguna so deeply. Her writings and discussions inspired Bahuguna to devote himself to mountain villages and to understand the bond between these villages and nature. Though Mira Behn’s environmental projects met with mixed success, her legacy lived on as Bahuguna began to organize grassroots level communities along Gandhian lines. James adds ‘…in his association with Mira Behn, he came to understand that Gandhi saw things from their roots’ (p. 58).

Another Gandhian, Sarala Behn, was a major influence on Bahuguna. Lakshmi Ashram, Sarala Behn’s centre for the education of women, had Bahuguna’s future wife, Vimala Nautiyal, among its first students. Nautiyal’s influence on Bahuguna is significant: she made him give up politics, thereby changing the course of his life altogether. Together they set out to create another centre like Sarala Behn’s in Silyara, a backward area of the Tehri hills, calling it the Parvatiya Navjeevan Ashram, where they devoted themselves to service and education. At this time Bahuguna also started padyatras (foot marches) to nearby villages to spread Gandhi’s views on self-reliance. In time padyatras were to become his second nature. The sharab bandi (stop alcohol) movement against liquor outlets was also strengthened as a result of these padyatras.

Bahuguna’s interest in the condition of forests was growing all this while. James now chooses to discuss Bahuguna’s activism within the Chipko movement (Chapters 7-11), of which Bahuguna is sometimes considered the founder. James records that Bahuguna himself dismisses this, claiming to be only a messenger, spreading the word. Accordingly, James discusses the possible origins and nature of the Chipko movement. In understanding the Chipko movement, James avers that, ‘for Bahuguna, the Chipko movement was a women’s movement…’ (p. 92); this did not mean that men were excluded, but only that its issues were of greater importance to women. James explains that to Bahuguna the movement was entrenched in the rural development schemes of Mira Behn and Sarala Behn and in Gandhi’s idea of self-reliance.

James claims that his aim is to comprehend Bahuguna’s understanding of the movement and his activities in its context. Much has been written on the Chipko movement. Though James relies primarily on two accounts – those by Thomas Weber and Ramachandra Guha – he periodically goes back to Bahuguna’s insights to understand the movement from his context. The problems were many. The timber industry had over many decades depleted the forests. Further depletion of forests through auctioning was still rampant. The local women were especially concerned with the loss of native trees that provided for family needs and livestock fodder. There was a loss of jobs as contractors often hired labour from outside the area. The political situation at the time the Chipko sentiment first made an appearance exacerbated the problem. The persons in charge did not understand the problems of the hill people or the nature of their protest. The floods of 1970 were proof that deforestation could have devastating results. There appears to have been dissatisfaction all around. James discusses Bahuguna’s padyatras through villages to explain the injustices involved, to organize demonstrations against unfair government policies, convincing the media to report on the discrimination against hill people, and going on fast against unjust practices. Over time the movement gained strength and became more widespread. James describes Bahuguna’s ‘charisma’ when he interacted with people – he inspired young people, reaching out to village people in words they could relate to. He coined slogans spontaneously, so much so that many looked upon him as the leader of the Chipko movement, a claim Bahuguna has consistently denied.

In the course of his conversations with Bahuguna, James gathered that there were certain features that contributed to the achievements of the movement, what he calls ‘modes’ of the Chipko movement. Of these, Bahuguna personally undertook the first and the fourth and supported the other two. The first mode was the padyatra. Bahuguna walked an impressive 4200 kms between 1973-75, sharing his views on the value of forests and the nature of the Chipko movement. The second mode was the folk song that imparted Chipko messages and had popular appeal. The third mode, with a religious dimension, was that of telling stories, particularly from the Bhagavat Katha, stressing that forest protection was not isolated from the divine, but closely related. The fourth mode was the fast. It has been commented of Bahuguna that he is the only man to go on a fast unto death for the sake of trees. James writes, ‘In discussing his fasts with me, Sunderlal emphasized that the fast is not a hunger strike but an act of devotion to God’ (p. 118) that has the gravity and power to convert the other side. Fasts played an important role for Bahuguna precisely for this reason.

So my question is how good is ISBF, Delhi? Apparently, it's affiliated with University of London, with ""academic direction"" from London School of Economics. I'm not too sure about this as this is literally the first time I'm hearing about this institution (pardon my ignorance). I couldn't find much about it on other websites, either. I'm looking at a BBA (or a BSc in Business & Management in ISBF's case) from either Symbiosis, Pune or NMIMS, Mumbai. 

I have the option to go abroad, but I honestly doubt if it's worth spending 80L+ when I could get a similar degree in about 10L. Of course, the knowledge and exposure I'd get would be tremendous and I'd get a better pay as a fresher, but I doubt it's worth the extra $$$.

What do you guys feel? Thanks :D",6
How do I start investing in the stock market here? Can someone with experience help me out?,66,4dfdi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4dfdi7/how_do_i_start_investing_in_the_stock_market_here/,47,1459869271.0," x post from r/indiainvestments :

So I'm 22. Just out of college having studied finance and business, I feel I am ready to start with a small amount, I have a little over a Lakh saved for stocks. My questions are, what is the best method to invest in them personally? ie I want to manage it myself, not a broker or anything. Secondly, I am aware of the Valuation methods such as DDM and Cash FLow Valuation. I can even do a thorough financial Analysis of the company's accounts having a finance background. My dad said a lot of that wont be useful in India as there is a lot of dirty business going on and not a lot of it is done on merit. Guys that have been doing it for a while, it would be great if you could share your stories and help a young guy out.",6

UNION BUDGET 2019:-

Summary:  Low impact on personal finance as such.  There are some good noises on NBFC, startup, etc.  More help given to small businesses in GST.  Gold duty hiked to 12.5%.

Edit: Custom duty hike in many electronic items. This can affect your purchase decisions.  Mi phones may become cheaper than OnePlus :-)

&nbsp;  

1. what exactly is the problem at DHFL?  
1. are they seeing poor loan repayments by home loan borrowers?  
1. is this the canary-in-coalmine   situation for a wider home-loan / real estate crash in India ?  
1. what causes led to this situation?   
1. did DHFL lend too aggressively / to 'sub prime' borrowers?  
1. what other lenders did similar practices , and are likely to face similar situation?  
1. is there any link between ILFS situation and DHFL ?  
1. if DHFL crashes (like ~~NSDL~~ NSEL, Giranjali gems, Kingfisher, etc) what would be the wider consequences? would their retail home-loan borrowers still need to continue paying EMIs after the lender company is liquidated / closed? (kek)    
1. from whom has DHFL borrowed money? what would be that lender's impact?  
1. are real-estate builders impacted in any manner due to this?  
* would this be yet another case of ""socialise the losses"" and hence some govt company (LIC esp) rescuing DHFL ?",6
Mourning the demise (?) of Jet Airways,79,beaonr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/beaonr/mourning_the_demise_of_jet_airways/,36,1555551597.0,"I am surprised to see absence of Jet Airways closure in my r/india feed.

I flew on their BOM-AMD/BDQ leg couple of times and was very impressed by their customer service. They did a pretty good job in transferring international travellers to domestic route including luggage transfer. Also, as an international traveler, I was served hot delicious breakfast even on a 45 minutes flight, which was perhaps the best way to welcome back an NRI

Never got a chance to fly on their YYZ-BOM leg. Will always be a pipe dream.

Jet airways closure will be an interesting case for MBA finance students, and a reminder to all people - Always pay your bills on time!

■ **Ornit Shahni, [How India Became Democratic](https://penguin.co.in/book/uncategorized/how-india-became-democratic/) (Penguin, 2018)**

Shahni's book is a fascinating historical account of how the first electoral rolls in India were prepared. This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process.

Banerjee's book is an ethnographic study that attempts to answer the question of why Indians exercise their right to vote. Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process.

IAS officers generally have no technical knowledge of the area they lead. Now from RR, we have gone down to the level of this guy who raped us with his demo execution.

Now, does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? I couldn't find out. Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit.

What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. We just don't have daily interaction with the RBI, so most don't know or care. RBI policies and actions affect everything. And I mean everything! As if demo isn't a good example of that.",6

"Suddenly, ‘one nation, one policy’ sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman",6,azoh6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azoh6g/suddenly_one_nation_one_policy_sentiment_is/,3,1552304367.0,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

Broke up 30! What next???,14,al2pdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/al2pdh/broke_up_30_what_next/,12,1548813778.0,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

M21, Delhi

&#x200B;

I've invented a stationary utility device and now want to turn it in a business. I've applied for design, patent,trademarks as Intellectual properties. I have completed msme and gst registration. i've prepared visiting cards, proprietor stamp, installed billing software and a 100 pgs letterpad. I have a batch of 400 pcs ready to test the market .  I won't disclose it before the launch so please don't ask about it (no offence).

Not bragging just giving the information, I've done everything alone from research to paperwork to purchase raw material to manufacturing( plastic parts come from factory. i have to assemble it and pack in the box) to finance/money stuff (ca does gst returns). It has really taken a toll on me.

&#x200B;

here's my work environment.

i want to operate from home. my parents are agreed to this and i have access to half of first floor. it's a single room where i do the assembly(tightening screws to join parts) and packing and in one corner i have a table where i do rest of company related work from a laptop.

i'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.

&#x200B;

i really don't have budget for renting a shop and hiring employee. i want to execute this testing phase alone. if it'll be successfull then i'll get a shop, employees and other equipments but rightnow i don't want to create too much financial burdon on my parents

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

my queries are

1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.
2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

&#x200B;

3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.

&#x200B;

4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

&#x200B;

5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

&#x200B;

6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\*\*\*\* hain.

anything else you want to advice me you're welcome guys. I'm just a 21 year old trying to escape from the rat race and want to really contribute something to the world.

"With the recent Oxfam India Inequality report & Congress' Minimum Income Guarantee announcement, why aren't we discussing AOC's 70% marginal tax in India already?",5,alx3kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/alx3kj/with_the_recent_oxfam_india_inequality_report/,4,1549016003.0,"[Oxfam Report](https://scroll.in/latest/910224/oxfam-inequality-report-indias-richest-1-grew-by-39-in-2018-bottom-half-by-3)

[Minimum Income Guarantee](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/congress-beats-bjp-to-income-guarantee-plan-but-leaves-math-to-manifesto)

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",6
"So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.",25,9ypjsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9ypjsr/so_you_made_yourself_a_little_bit_of_money_huh/,11,1542724145.0,"# So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.
&nbsp;

All your life, all you've ever wanted, is a little bit of money. And congratulations, now you have it. Does it feel nice? Does it feel like a dream come true? Of course it doesn't. It's all just numbers on a screen, staring at you like a pathetic joke. But thanks to your thankless job, you made yourself a little bit of money. How nice.

And now, you, in all your half-decayed intelligence, have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that you've made? Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. 

But don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.

Before you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. 

&nbsp;
##### Savings are sexy
Let's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.

&nbsp;
##### Debt is your kryptonite
So you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.

&nbsp;
##### Read like your life depends on it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.

&nbsp;
##### Gold is old
Gold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.

&nbsp;
##### Insurance =/= Investing
While housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.

&nbsp;
##### Real estate is not real investing
The only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.

&nbsp;
##### Pick your poison properly
Identifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.

&nbsp;
##### Get yourself into a coma
The best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.

&nbsp;
##### Don't watch CNBC
All your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.

&nbsp;
##### Keep It Simple, Shithead
Here is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:
 
|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |
| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |
 
When you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.

&nbsp;

This basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? 

The lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.

Always keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.

"Due to family problems, I had to forego my college education. Now I may have the option to finally do something about that. Please advice me on how to proceed?

&#x200B;

I come from a middle-class family in Gujarat, and I passed my 12th commerce from a CBSE school. I got good grades and was able to enroll in a very good college in Mumbai, and everything was going well for me. After I got my admission I went back to my hometown to prepare to move to Mumbai in a hostel, when my grandfather who was already in ill-health passed away.

&#x200B;

Now he did not have a will and most of what we owned was in my father's elder brothers name already and what was in my grandfathers name was usurped by him as well. He kicked my father out of the family business as well as made threats for us to leave the place we were staying in(It was registered to my grandpas name). This meant my own families financial status went from somewhat stable to completely in shambles. We were blindsided and that meant I had to stay and help my father weather the storm. At first I thought we'd bounce back in a month or 2 and having never known poverty I never knew ho much people struggled. But it only got worse for us. My father is an 8th pass and could not get normal jobs, so he decided to start a new business and I took a job with a friend of his due to my English skills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some time passed then scumbag had us evicted as he and my aunt(bua) made some deal that she should have the house. I do not know the details of what they did but we were forced to rent a place and our already poor finances were shot to pieces. My father started to work as a salesman cause no other option and I took on a bigger role at his friends place. But things were still hard and we were barely making ends meet.

&#x200B;

I forgot all about my college and education, never going back to Mumbai after my enrollment. My family trudged along for 2 and a half years but things are changing now. My father has a childhood friend who is offering my father a good role in his business back in their old village. He is moving there and starts at first November. Now he told me that I can finally go to Mumbai and finish my college if I wanted to but I'm not even sure what to do at this point.

&#x200B;

I never went to Mumbai after my admission but this year would have been my final year. Am I still even enrolled there? They have my documents as I never collected them back. But I never paid any fees except what you pay on enrollment. My father wants me to go and try to study as he thinks his lack of education was a major reason for our family's crisis cause he had nothing to fall back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I don't even know if I am enrolled there anymore. The college is affiliated with Mumbai university but I could not find any details about their code on skipping exams\[By exams I mean skipping everything :( \] on google. And even If I'm still enrolled how long would it take me to finish my degree. Hell at this point I'm pondering is a [B.com](https://B.com) even worth it? My dream was to do a masters from foreign but even If I finish my degree will I get enrollment in any institute as I had these many drop years. I am really confused at this point weather to move to the village with my family or try to pursue an education.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any knowledge on how Mumbai university operates or even any advice on how to proceed please help me.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr : Scumbag uncle and aunt usurped everything and I could not attend a single day of college. Now I may finally be able to go but Idk if I am even enrolled there anymore. Please help. Any advice appreciated.",6

Why not learn from China, how it brought down pollution in Beijing during the last few years?




FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: “I am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act”. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire — learning to unlearn yesterday’s wisdom.

You ride on seaplane during Gujarat election, didn't left enough water for irrigation in Narmada dam. Why?
Today coastal Saurashtra is in submerged condition, forget about sea plane there isn't enough life savings boat, how can you afford seaplane?

Research fellows from IIT will be paid Rs. 70000 as stipend. Why not extend this from other institutions too? For instance, JRFs are given Rs. 25k, SRF’s Rs. 28k and RA’s Rs. 35k-40k

Experts in the field of solid waste management know that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan can become the biggest employer, and solve several issues. But state govts and municipalities continue their nexus with contractors who charge astronomical sums for waste-handling equipment and for transportation of waste.

FEDERAL DEMOCRACY


1. It is obvious that a number of states with different parties in power are doing some things right, going by the positive outcomes. Federal Democracy is here to stay. But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere.


2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka.



HEALTH CARE



Why does the government not take inspiration from NHS scheme in the UK (which provides efficient and great healthcare to UK residents)?


Why does the gov not allocating enough budget for health care despite india ranking low in HDI even with our neighbours countries ?

Why does government not invest in Cyber Security like other major countries like China, Russia and USA? Our government websites and databases are not fully secured (as evident from data being accessed by fs0ciety from AP govt. website) We have great Security Engineers, but they are all employed in Private Sector.


Why was AAP asked to repay the amount they spent from government treasury on advertisement, but BJP keeps plastering Modi’s photo everyday in the newspapers and online advertisement (nearly Rs 4600 crores) without any repercussions?

As valuator I have been holding approved licence from other competent authority of India too.

I am Diploma Automobile, post diploma in sales management, B Tech (Mech), MBA Finance, Fellow IIISLA, Alternate dispute resolution and other professional qualifications also. I have my own proprietorship company and having office in prime location of Ahmedabad city of India. As a surveyor we get the allotment of work from insurers. As valuator we generally get the valuation work from banking sector, NBFC etc for refinance purpose of assets like cars, commercial vehicles, Engineering equipment, plant & machineries, earth movers, mining equipment etc.   

Looking to the current scenario of India-Ahmedabad. it seems that the some of the issues like inflation, population, traffic, pollution, reservation, parking issues etc are never going to be solved. They are being increased day by day. India has become of 130 cr. Mentality of certain class people are on too below level and we feel that it is never going to be changed. Business scenario is also being deteriorated due drastic and impractical changes in government policy. Political leaders are minting their own except few. As per international media India is growing but as per my experience picture of actual India is different.

For last 3 years l have been getting job offer from Canada. In 2016 from Alberta and in 2017 from British Columbia etc. I was not sincere about these offers. Taking in a view the worth uses of qualifications, experience and Looking further for better future of my sons I think sincerely this time. The offer is from St john- New Brunswick.

New Bruns wick is an Atlantic province out of total 4 provinces. St john have population of 7.50 lacs approximately. The population have been deviated in last 4 years due to some unknown reasons. I have been offered 60,00 Canadian Dollar per annum from General Insurance company of St John- New Brunswick Canada.  I will be deputed at St John only. I assume that the offer is via authentic consultant of Canada. It is to be noted that nothing is written as off now. I will have to sign the bond for 2 years for the job of said company.  As per my knowledge job profile in st john is same as India. 

The role will be as collision surveyor that is my core competence.   
I have following queries:

01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer???


02. Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.


03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence.  Are these the information appropriate???


04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??


05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.


07. Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??


08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??


09. My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?  

10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???


11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??


12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?


13. My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.

India and its States: some states are too much populated to govern efficiently,9,9zgjc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9zgjc8/india_and_its_states_some_states_are_too_much/,4,1542939833.0,"Hello everyone, let's discuss about our states. We all know that some of our states are too populated to govern efficiently. However, creation of so many smaller states is very difficult. So, we need Autonomous Regions (AR).

For example, UP has close to 200 million people. There are only four countries on earth with more population than UP ! Even Maharashtra and Bihar had 100 million plus people in 2011. West Bengal had more than 91 million in 2011 too. There are only 13 countries on earth with 100 million club. The US state with highest population is California (39 mil), we have 11 states with more than that.

So, it seems that for better serving the populace we need states with lesser population. State governments tend to keep all power in the hands of a select few leaders and thus failed to spread development evenly around the state.

However, dividing our states into smaller one would be very problematic. It would create political shit storms and turmoils so powerful that no central government would withstand that. Just see what happened during the creation of Telengana. 

So, the better solution would be dividing states into semi-autonomous regions. There are 14 such regions already exist in India like Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Kargil, Ladakh etc.

Bigger states should be divided into a few autonomous regions (AR). It would have its own local governments with limited powers.

The AR's could be like that:

1) Population below 10 millions except the Metropolis AR's like Mumbai, Kolkata etc.

2) The local government of the AR should be formed via Panchayet and Municipal elections by their elected members. Another extra election should be avoided.

3) These AR's should have powers and funds for village and town developments, local road constructions, sanitations, health cares, school education, waterbody and forest conservation, tourism development, industrial developments, land and land reforms etc.

4) The state government will control the police, judiciary, state civil services, higher educational institutions, state highways etc.

5) The state government and the central agencies will collect the taxes. The ARs would collect some local taxes like tolls, small business license fees etc. The tax revenues would be distributed among the AR's, state governments and the central government by the rules of the finance commissions.

6) The AR's would have limited legislative powers which would enables them to pass some laws. However, they would be under the legislative authority of the state.

7) So, there could be more than hundreds of such AR. Every metro city city should form its own AR.

Let's debate.

I am surprised to see so much misplaced expectations and ignorance among MBA aspirants.

I am currently working as a researcher at a think tank that evaluates quality of management education.

So, according to me, here is some general gyan -

Unless you are from top 25 B School in India, your MBA / PGDM is absolutely worthless job wise.

Private B Schools ranked outside rank 25, are only interested in your ""money"". 

Students joining outside 25 rank Private B Schools will face these hardships -

(1) Placement process will be non-transparent, skewed to benefit favorites of the institute, very few good companies.

(2) Lack of summer placements. 

(3) Some even fudge their placement figures.

(4) Average salary declared is almost always untrue.

(5) 100% placement never happens.

(6) Favoritism based on chamcha giri is rampant, you will get better grades/placement based on that.

(7) You will come across relatives or friends of the founder of the private B School posing as ""Faculty"". 

(8) Alumni networking will be non-existent. 

Also, Business Analytics is a new MBA major specialization being offered with traditional Finance/Marketing/HR. 

It makes sense to opt this from job perspective.",6

A big thank you to all good Samaritans of r/India for their advice and feedback.

I am the ""friend"" mentioned in the original post.

My friend has given me access to this reddit account after seeing the response.

I experienced outright rejection during my recent MBA entry level job interviews due to my situation.

I was depressed, angry and confused about my future.

I was very skeptical if r/India could really help me out with my situation.

But all your feedback and suggestions, have given me a new hope.

**Original Post by my friend:**

Law graduates of r/India, Please share your views on this :

My close friend is a cancer survivor.

He is 36 years old. 

He has these two career options in mind -

(1) Whether he should get back into IT industry as he has 4.5 year's of coding experience in C#. If yes, what steps.

and

(2) Whether to pursue law as his MBA Finance has given him good exposure to Mergers And Acquisitions (M&A),  Business laws and Taxation.

I am asking your help/advice/suggestion for Query No (2) i.e, He wants to study law at the age of 36 years.

He is appearing for these law exams in 2018 -

CLAT, IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam and DU LLB exam.

He says that there is no age limit for studying law and practicing law. 

Is there any merit to it ? (I don't know anything about careers after law education.)

His family supports him wholeheartedly, but they need clarity on how exactly can pursuing LLB law education help my friend at the age of 36.

Please, Please upvote for visibility.

Edit:

Being a cancer survivor, my friend was unemployed close to 3-4 years during his cancer treatment.

Recently, he secured a part time decent teaching job that can become full time.

His family is unhappy that he will resign from his present job, which he secured through lots of effort against all odds.

So, Is there any merit in his decision to take up law education at this age.",6
The Kerala Model,142,79u1il,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/79u1il/the_kerala_model/,159,1509460867.0,"Let's have an objective discussion of the merits & sustainability of the Kerala model. Please don't downvote if you merely disagree. 



1. Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. To claim that Kerala is high on HDI purely from post-independence governments is a bit of a stretch; they started out with a relatively compact population (13.5m in 1951) and the most advantages among states, thanks to the focus on education by the local dynastic precursors, the Travancore Family, along with contributions with subgroups like the Nair Society and Christian Missionaries. 





3. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foeign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.

[Source](https://medium.com/@thousifmohammed/why-kerala-rank-last-in-ease-of-doing-business-7da7ed96d113) 


5. Consequently, abysmal FDI inflows, at just over US$1.2billion in 2000-15 (the last 15 years), just 0.5% of total inflows. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka received over US$17billion and US$16billion respectively in the same period.

6. High Debt/GSDP of 29.7% (2015 Budget Estimate) compared to an India-average of 21.2%. Though that's an estimate, the 2014 Revised Estimate was 31% and 2013 actual one was 31.6%. I would take the estimate with a grain of sand. [Source](http://niti.gov.in/content/debt-total-outstanding-liabilities-percenatge-gsdp) This is also with them having a monopoly over the liquor industry through BEVCO, and one of the highest per-capita consumption levels of alcohol by state.

2. And finally, **the extreme dependence on remittances:** Remittances finance as many as 20% Kerala households, or 2.4 million families. Assuming a family size of three, remittances directly affect 7.2 million of 35 million Keralites, according to a recent paper in the Economic and Political Weekly by K C Zachariah and S Irudaya Rajan based on the Kerala Migration Survey, 2014. [Source](http://www.firstpost.com/india/gulf-remittances-to-kerala-drop-to-four-year-low-due-to-declining-oil-prices-2738866.html)



* Remittances, at Rs 70,000 crore, accounted for 36.3% of the net state domestic product (NSDP) in 2014.



* Remittances constitute a fourth — Rs 22,689 of Rs 86,180 — of the per capita income of Kerala in 2014.



* Remittances were 1.2 times the revenue generated by the Kerala government in 2014.

I like this summary: **“Remittances from global capitalism are carrying the whole Kerala economy,”** said S. Irudaya Rajan, a demographer at the Center for Development Studies, a local research group. “There would have been starvation deaths in Kerala if there had been no migration. The Kerala model is good to read about but not practically applicable to any part of the world, including Kerala.” [Source: NYTimes- Jobs Abroad Support ‘Model’ State in India.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/world/asia/07migrate.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1) It's a pretty good read.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

TL;DR – Godman to Tycoon – The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev,549,6s4hoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6s4hoh/tldr_godman_to_tycoon_the_untold_story_of_baba/,95,1502127309.0,"Context – Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. 

On the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It’s published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. 

So here we go

* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. 

* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna

* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.

* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important

* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.

* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities

* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship 

* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.

* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. 

* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. 

* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat

* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action

* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev’s Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying “I have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving”. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. 

* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party – **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** 

* The Takeover of Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.

* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev’s political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘Some people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma’. Soon Ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.

* Ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**

* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO – **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev’s business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra’s influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. 

* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee – **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)

* Part of the reason for Patanjali’s market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section – [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) 

* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.

Ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. 

Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.

Edit 1: Formatting

Edit 2: Woah! Thanks for the Gold kind stranger. Though I would rather have people reading the book. While Indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired, ventures like these must be encouraged.

"Debunked: ""Do the maths: India's first bullet train isn't 'free of cost' as Modi claims"" - lazy journalist",96,717dlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/717dlb/debunked_do_the_maths_indias_first_bullet_train/,45,1505895784.0,"The article in question: http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/do-the-math-india-s-first-bullet-train-isn-t-free-of-cost-as-modi-claims-117091800116_1.html

###Scumbag journalist: 

###Writes article saying ""Do the math"". Does no math.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

>The 508km-long Mumbai to Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) is scheduled for completion in December 2023, but commencement date has been sought to be advanced to August 2022.

>Initially, each high speed train will have 10 cars and the capacity to accommodate 750 people, The Times of India said. It will increase to 16 cars that will accommodate 1,200 people.

>According to initial estimates, around 1.6 crore people are expected to travel by the bullet train annually. By 2050, around 1.6 lakh commuters should travel by the high-speed train on a daily basis.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

We really need to talk about Flairs.,106,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,1494883276.0,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",6

Globalization is supposed to be about the free movement of people, goods, and capital. But in fact, the system is set up to enable that mobility mainly for the rich (or for large corporations).

The result is global tax evasion, the offshoring of labor, and an elite that flies 35,000 feet over the problems of nation states and the tax payers within them.""


PANAMA: No questions asked!

The ways of India’s rich and famous are increasingly becoming public knowledge. The disclosure that as many as five hundred prominent Indian’s, including Incredible India’s latest brand ambassador - Amitabh Bachchan, owned offshore companies in Panama is just the latest of the unraveling. All one can say is that he is in the good company of the likes of Vladimir Putin, David Cameron and Nawaz Sharif among others.

Panama is a small sliver of a country in Central America joining North and South America. Its immediate geographical neighbors are Costa Rica in the north and Colombia in the south. It is the narrow isthmus that separates the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. A 77 kilometers long manmade canal capable of accommodating large ships joins the two oceans. The revenues from this were for long the nations biggest source of income since the canal opened in 1914.

Panama soon found that becoming a tax haven that assured investors of their privacy provided a more lucrative income. The proximity to the Americas, and the balmy Caribbean islands, and countries like Colombia with its huge cocaine production and export business, and Latin America’s many kleptomaniac tin pot dictators made Panama even more attractive. Till not long ago the Canal Zone was under the protection of US troops and that too served as an incentive for Americans seeking an offshore tax haven.

Panama is a tax haven, which means it is a country that offers foreign individuals and businesses little or no tax liability in a fairly politically and economically stable environment. Tax havens also provide little or no financial information to foreign tax authorities. This in short is the reason Panama is so important to our moneyed people who have good reason to hide their real wealth.

Why do the rich then want to hide their wealth? This is simply because officially they are not as wealthy as they really are. And if they honestly declared their true wealth they would not only be liable to pay more income tax but could also open many of them to various charges of corporate fraud and malfeasances that could earn them hefty prison terms.
To comprehend this one must understand how most of our “captains of industry” many of whom sit on the Prime Ministers Council of Trade and Industry became rich and powerful?

When an “industrialist” launches a new project, the project costs are usually hugely overstated. The suppliers of plant and machinery then pay the promoter kickbacks, which become the promoter capital. Thus, the more the number of projects an individual promotes the wealthier he or she becomes. But it is not income you can declare. So it gets hidden in a tax haven. This is how the big bucks are made and salted away.

A good part of this money is round tripped back to India via nearby tax havens like Mauritius or Singapore. Not surprisingly in 2015 the top FDI investing countries were Mauritius (27%) and Singapore (21%). Both are now the home of hundreds of corporate entities that act as a pass through for funds being held overseas for Indians or Indian entities. These countries are little more than cutouts for monies held in other more distant tax havens like Panama, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Lichtenstein. The smaller the country the more pliable the officials.

The fourteen PSU banks control almost 80% of the commercial credit advanced in India. In addition the government also owns the two big project finance institutions, IDBI and IFCI, and large institutional investors like LIC and general insurance companies like Oriental and GIC. The state ownership of these, with powers vested with the powers that be in New Delhi, political and bureaucratic, ensures that the projects are suitably “gold plated” without any rigorous scrutiny. And why scrutinize when projects seldom fold up and in a system where restructuring means lending more money to evergreen the loans?

The list of NPA’s includes almost the entire roster of top Indian companies. As of June 2016, the total amount of Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) for public and private sector banks is around Rs. 6 lakh crore. The NPA figures along with total debt for each of the 49 public and private sector banks were shared by the Ministry of Finance in response to a Parliament question. According to RBI estimates, the top 30 loan defaulters currently account for one-third of the total gross NPA’s of PSU banks. Till March 31, 2015, the country’s top five PSU banks had outstandings of Rs 4.87 lakh crore to just 44 borrowers, if borrowers were to be categorized in terms of those having outstandings of over Rs 5,000 crore. These businesses include Essar, Reliance ADAG, Jaiprakash Associates, Adani's, GVK, GMR and Lanco. Some of them like Essar have defaulted in the before. This stress problem is fairly endemic.

Of the big companies or groups only Tata’s, Reliance Industries and AV Birla can be considered free of financial stress. Most if not all the money earned by gold plating plant and machinery, under invoicing of exports and over invoicing of imports is retained abroad. Has anyone wondered why the UAE is the second largest destination of India’s merchandise exports ($33 billion in 2015) and third largest source of merchandise imports ($26.2 billion in 2015)?

The UAE is also the largest source of legal and illicitly imported gold. Last year India officially imported over 900 tons of gold worth $35 billion. The mysteriously owned corporations incorporated in tax havens like Panama mostly finance these exports. And a good part of the illicitly exported gold also.

According to Global Financial Integrity, a Washington DC based think-tank; Indians were estimated to have illicitly sent out $83 billion in 2015. Where does this money go? Countries like Switzerland that offer banking secrecy usually do not pay any interest on such deposits. So money goes to corporations in tax havens from where they are invested in businesses world over. Have you ever wondered how many of our top businessmen have managed to become so big overseas so soon?
This is where the Panama’s of the world come in. 

There was a time when Panama in India was synonymous with a cheap brand of cigarettes manufactured by the Dalmia Golden Tobacco Company. In the West, Panama was a man's wide-brimmed straw hat made from the leaves of the Toquilla tropical palm tree. That Panama too is now forgotten. Now Panama is synonymous with offshore corporations and assured secrecy. The times have changed.

What are my options?,37,7a8no5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7a8no5/what_are_my_options/,25,1509618876.0,"So I read a post about a teen about his options if he went ahead to skip college and I wanted to know what options I got.

But lets say, if I were to join the work force at the age of 30, what skills can I self-teach to make myself employable in the next 7-8 years? I mostly do door-to-door sales for my business, but not sure if I enjoy that. Programming, graphic design, AI, etc. what would you suggest? I am average at maths. 

I am not planning to get a masters degree. Will that hurt me in the future?

Opportunity for crypto investors in India (subject to an assumption),4,8b6sq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8b6sq8/opportunity_for_crypto_investors_in_india_subject/,6,1523387545.0,"In light of the ring fencing of banks by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its first monetary policy review of 2018-19, entities regulated by RBI shall, with immediate effect, not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs. Banks & other financial institutions which are already providing such services have been given a window of **3 months** to terminate these services.

Even though the exchanges & crypto community in India are seeking remedial action against RBI's diktat, I am not very hopeful that we'll be able to get a stay order from the Supreme Court of India in favour of crypto-currencies. The primary reason for my skepticism being the *little to no understanding of the crypto world that Indian government possesses.* It's noteworthy and depressing at the same time that Finance Minister of India [compared cryptocurrencies to ponzi schemes late last year.](https://qz.com/1171183/bitcoin-is-neither-legal-nor-illegal-in-india-and-everyones-confused/)

Not many users out here know that [Indian crypto markets crashed flat 25-30%](http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/with-rbi-s-near-ban-announcement-cryptocurrency-prices-crash-sharply-118040501410_1.html) in less than an hour of RBI notification on **April 5, 2018** because of panic selling by investors whereas the foreign exchanges didn't show any substantial fluctuations because of the same.

This decline in value is sure to repeat at the end of the 3 months window (keeping in mind the **assumption** that RBI's decision holds at the end of these 3 months) with a greater percentage fall this time because investors will not be able to convert their fiat to crypto anymore in India for the immediate future. Personally, I won't be much surprised if XRP value comes down to 0.05$-0.10$ at that time. Without any exception, same shall be the fate of other VCs too.

So, the opportunity lies for those who have accounts with foreign banks since they shall be able to procure cryptocurrencies at dirt cheap prices here in India and be able to sell them abroad at the normal prices prevailing in world markets. This shall be beneficial for both categories of people, those looking to profit out of arbitrage and those intending to HODL them. I admit this post benefits only some investors based on their geographical presence and not the cryptoverse at large but one should make the most of what she/he has. *When life throws rocks at you, build a fort out of them.* ;)

Looking forward to positive feedback from you all :)",6

Indian banking system under attack!,168,589exo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/589exo/indian_banking_system_under_attack/,84,1476898470.0,"I have a strong reason to believe that Indian banking is under systematic attack. The shit hole goes very deep and the problem is compounded by the fact that the media ""tones"" down its coverage (obviously to avoid panic). There are malware attacks (on ICICI which is siphoning of email contacts and sending its account holders phishing emails), Advanced persistent threats on Axis Bank (they disclosed this to RBI), ATM frauds as in State Bank of India and multiple accounts of phishing attacks on individuals. Union Bank has also suffered cyber heist. 

A worrying trend is by use of SIM Swap. Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp), your details through identity thefts and blocking your actual SIM's so that you cannot receive the SMS alerts. 

Two factor authentication is very basic (dependent on passwords alone) which again can be easily retrieved because most users re-use their passwords. 

Its getting scarier and worsened. 


A simple remedy as of now is to change PIN of your existing debit card and get ""CHIP and PIN"" card which secures transaction because they cannot be replicated easily. Of course, moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised. 

Edit 1: In response to ""proofs"" and so called ""click bait""; here are the links. Please connect the dots. 
Further, BBM and Threema allow you to be anonymous because outside the system, they can't do anything to your PINS. :-)

Any income of a political party which is chargeable under the head ""Income from house property"" or ""Income from other sources"" or ""Capital gains"" or any income by way of voluntary contributions received by a political party from any person shall not be included in the total income of the previous year of such political party :

Provided that—

(b) in respect of each such voluntary contribution 12[other than contribution by way of electoral bond] in excess of twenty thousand rupees, such political party keeps and maintains a record of such contribution and the name and address of the person who has made such contribution; 13[and]

(d)  no donation exceeding two thousand rupees is received by such political party otherwise than by an account payee cheque drawn on a bank or an account payee bank draft or use of electronic clearing system through a bank account or through electoral bond.


To explain it out for you, it basically states that any income except the one chargeable from business or profession is exempt from tax provided that the party abides by certain conditions.

Stay in an excellent job vs come back to live with my family?,32,65nu2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/65nu2c/stay_in_an_excellent_job_vs_come_back_to_live/,47,1492352581.0,"I am in a very big dilemma right now. I have to choose between staying in my current job in Netherlands and become a wealthy man or going back to my own country and stay with my family(and not be so wealthy).

Background:

A bit of a background, I come from a south asian (pakistan,india,bangladesh) country where I lived with my family. I live with my mom, brother and little sister. I am 28 years old and not married. I am responsible for the finances of my house. So i pay for everything, including the college fee of my brother and sister and daily expenses such as food, electricity, rent etc. The college fee is done now as they are both in their last semester. Although, I will still be responsible for our daily expenses.

I recently went to the Netherlands and studied there for two years. I got a degree and even found a really nice job.

I have two options to choose from:

**Option 1: Stay at my current Job in Netherlands**

I have a really nice job in the Netherlands. There is such a big difference in the working conditions that I don't think I can work as a software engineer when I come back home.

My one month's salary in Netherlands is equal to my 3-4 months salary in my own country. In fact the difference in salary is so big that I dont think I can work as a software engineer when I go back home. It will just feel wrong to me to do the same type of work for 1/4th of the money.

Almost all companies treat you like a human in the Netherlands. They have really nice laws about employment law. I don't have to work overtime and even if I do work overtime, I will be paid for the overtime. This is not the case in my own country. In my country they expect you to work overtime and think you are not motivated if you refuse. And they will never pay you for overtime.

In the Netherlands you can be on sick leave for a maximum of two years and still get paid salary. Though it is not so common to be sick for so long but it is really comforting to know. In my country they start deducting your holidays when you are sick. And when all of your holidays are gone then they start deducting your salary. And if you dont show up after two months then there is a big chance you will be let go.

Besides my job, I have other benefits in the Netherlands. I have been on so many dates in the Netherlands which was not so easy in my country. Online dating is still non-existent in my country. I currently have a girlfriend in the Netherlands. I feel really free and independent in terms of dating. I can go to anyone's house and invite any girl in my own house I also have nice public transport, online shopping for almost all video games, books, clothes etc. I have a really nice gym. The only career i can think of having when I go back is do my own business.

While living in Netherlands has good points, there are also some bad things. There are some things that make me hate Netherlands sometimes. If I stay there for one year without a holiday then I get really miserable. I really miss my family on my holidays. I also feel that they sometimes look at us in a condescending way.I have had a lot of incidents related to racism. It seems like they feel like they are much better than us. I have been asked all sorts of questions like : Is there a tv in your country? Do you have internet in your country? Do you know what a washing machine is ? Sometimes people give me a look of disgust even. And they get more weird if they know I am a muslim. 
 
**Option 2: Go back to my home country and live with my family**

I mentioned a lot of really nice things in the first option but I really miss my family and my country's food. My mom is always very sad when my holidays are up and I have to go back. She is always crying when I leave. She said that I can stay in the Netherlands for as long as I want but she is happy when I am around. My little sister also misses me. She told me that I should come back next year. She is going to be married in a few years then I wont be able to see her so often. When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.

Regarding finances, i will have around 20k$ of savings by next year. What is your opinion?",6
What does r/India think of Bitcoin? India must act now or miss out on this emerging technology.,40,6f3v9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6f3v9z/what_does_rindia_think_of_bitcoin_india_must_act/,29,1496556903.0,"Bitcoin currently has grown so much in size that its market cap is bigger than any of USA's top airlines. Yes, these are Airlines like Delta with hundred's and hundreds of Boeing airplanes in their fleet connecting every city of America yet a simple technology run on a computer has usurped all these airlines. No mean feat. 

Australia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming. 

Meanwhile Indian Gov is actively trying to play down BTC, some ministers are still calling it scam, play of the devil, likening it with ""chit funds"" etc. What the fuck is wrong with the finance brains and the IT brains of our country that we (as a country) are missing out on the biggest IT development since world wide web thanks to illiterates talking their talk. 

And Im not talking about middle men like ""Zebpay"" and ""Unocoin"" - Bitcoin was invented to cut these middlemen out of the chain, yet these are the ones who are profiting selling BTC to Indians at a 25% markup price and taking a hefty commission. 

We are also giving a big play to more middle men companies like PayTM who are trying to reinvent the currency wheel and are doing such a bad job at it, yet most Indians will tell you that PAYTM is the best and Bitcoin is a scam. Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them - yet PAYTM is such a big rage here - outdated technology, very poor profitablity, the PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm.


Make no mistake, India will follow the rest of the world eventually, as we always do, and end up accepting BTC in 2020, but by that time the world would have already moved on and derived the most out of bitcoin. Many businesses are already hedging their funds vs BTC or investing part of their profits into BTC and the growth of 2500% since 2015 will only make more companies turn to BTC. 

Im sure many smart Indians have already started to see the potential of BTC, lets use this thread to discuss the market in India. ",6

#But wait... the Bill says 'Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services'. How are they allowed to do these *other* things?
___

There has been a lot of debate for years about the Aadhaar card. On March 16, Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 was passed as a money bill. During the debate, our finance minister said time and again that the Aadhaar cards will be used specifically for providing subsidies and other financial benefits. He *said* it, but if anyone had bothered to take a peek into the proposed bill, they would have understood what was going on. 

But alas, the bill was brought on a Friday, our representatives had to fly back home. It's [""Take out the Trash"" day](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4l3qup/how_pleb_mps_try_to_impose_their_will_and_fail/)! So, meh.

*For a detailed analysis of what the Aadhaar Bill contains and why it was passed a s money bill, [read this](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking)*

**Changing the bill *after* it becomes an Act**

Aye. That can be done. 

There is a whole **Clause 54** left lying around titled ""Power of Authority to make Regulations"" in the [passed Aadhaar Act, 2016](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/168717.pdf). This particular clause lets the government change multiple aspects of the bill by issuing notifications. These notifications are then supposed to be laid formally in both houses of Parliament once the next session begins.

[Clause 54: Regulations rock peepal!](http://imgur.com/A5DXwmx)

[MOAR REGULATIONS!](http://imgur.com/q5hLCrm)


Look at these particular subsections. The government can change provisions for any of these *without the prior approval of Parliament*:

- [Other purposes](http://imgur.com/wqW7aPQ)

- [Other tech safeguards](http://imgur.com/xrJZpCO)

- [Maintaining, updating and deletion of Aadhaar numbers](http://imgur.com/3xhjdhm)

All of these subsections are so bloody vague that they can cover anything that a citizen does. What the heck does ""other purposes"" even mean?!

I have never seen anyone in Parliament challenging a notification. Many Acts are slyly changed in this manner. Please note (before you start outraging about how evil the present government is), this phenomenon is not something that was started by the Modi government, all governments in the past have been doing it in one way or the other. By keeping the wordings vague in the proposed bill itself, it gives a leeway for the executive to change it at a later date without consulting Parliament.

But... this has to stop somewhere, right? RIGHT?

#What can we do about it now?
___
Well, nothing, I’m afraid. I just wanted to put it out there. The only public intervention possible was *before* the Bill became an Act.  

Unless the [Supreme Court strikes down the Aadhaar Act’s validity](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4g34n7/an_important_supreme_court_hearing_is_coming_up/) or says it’s an invasion of the fundamental right to privacy, the public can’t do anything about it except watch & get Aadhaar cards in the process. 

If the SC *does* strike the Act down, I’m afraid it might be too late. The government is already on an overdrive to get maximum Aadhaar registrations. They are claiming that more than a billion people are now registered, even Aanganwaadis and Government hospitals are doing daily drives to get newborns registered.


I will end with a quote by a wise fictional one eyed man called Alastor “Mad Eye” Moody:

Why are Indian entrance exams so different from globally accepted exams such as GMAT and SAT?,24,70fyiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/70fyiq/why_are_indian_entrance_exams_so_different_from/,13,1505582001.0,"[Articles such as this one](http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/do-engineers-have-an-advantage-in-cat-here-s-busting-all-myths/story-xJtJ7YMldPiDokQlU6bk7M.html) blatantly dismiss CAT's bias towards engineers as a myth. I'm fairly certain that the level of mathematics is that of 6th - 10th grades.


[This article](http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1952) seems to make more sense.


Moreover, NRIs who take admission in Indian engineering colleges receive the shock of their lives when they see that their fellow batchmates are already quite familiar with concepts of calculus that the SAT does not test at all. As a result, many of these students end up failing math in their first semester and might even begin a downward spiral due to depression.


Every year I keep hearing talks of IIMs wanting to be more like foreign b-schools where majority of the batch does not hail from an engineering background, but from commerce/business backgrounds. But it's not just about MBA programs. Even the batch profile of the Msc Finance program at JBIMS reveals that out of the 30 students it takes in, majority have engineering background.


I appeared for the interview at JBIMS. I'm a BBA - Finance grad and was asked what subjects I studied in BBA. I told them the subjects (Management accounting, strategic financial managemnt, etc.) and they countered asking, ""If you have already studied these subjects in graduation, why do you want to study them again in post grad?"". And here I thought that it would make more sense for business and commerce grads to pursue an MFin because that is much more coherent than jumping over to MFin from engineering.


Also, people generally say that the verbal sections are tougher in GMAT, then why is it that CAT is more anal retentive and fanatical about vocabulary?",6
I am forwarding an interesting story about world economy. How valid is it? I leave it to you. Another whatsapp forward,9,7jrv4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7jrv4g/i_am_forwarding_an_interesting_story_about_world/,8,1513290195.0,"Amazing logic indeed. This is a crazy world! Interesting article written by an Indian Economist

Japanese save a lot. They do not spend much. Also, Japan exports far more than it imports. Has an annual trade surplus of over 100 billion. Yet Japanese economy is considered weak, even collapsing.

Americans spend, save little. Also US imports more than it exports.
Has an annual trade deficit of over $400 billion. Yet, the American economy is considered strong and trusted to get stronger.

But where from do Americans get money to spend? They borrow from Japan, China and even India.
Virtually others save for the US to spend. Global savings are mostly invested in US, in dollars.

India itself keeps its foreign currency assets of over $50 billion in US securities. China has sunk over $160 billion in US securities.
Japan's stakes in US securities is in trillions.

Result:
The US has taken over $5 trillion from the world. So, as the world
saves for the US - It's The Americans who spend freely. Today, to keep the US consumption going, that is for the US economy to work, other
countries have to remit $180 billion every quarter, which is $2
billion a day, to the US!

A Chinese economist asked a neat question. Who has invested more, US in China, or China in US? The US has invested in China less than half of what China has invested in US.

The same is the case with India. It have invested in US over $50
billion. But the US has invested less than $20 billion in India.

Why the world is after US?

The secret lies in the American spending, that they hardly save. In fact they use their credit cards to spend their future income. That the US spends is what makes it attractive to export to the US. So US imports more than what it exports year after year.

The result:

The world is dependent on US consumption for its growth. By its deepening culture of consumption, the US has habituated the world to
feed on US consumption. But as the US needs money to finance its consumption, the world provides the money.

It's like a shopkeeper providing the money to a customer so that the customer keeps buying from the shop. If the customer will not buy, the shop won't have business, unless the shopkeeper funds him. The US is like the lucky customer. And the world is like the helpless shopkeeper
financier.

Who is America's biggest shopkeeper financier? Japan of course. Yet it's Japan which is regarded as weak. Modern economists complain that
Japanese do not spend, so they do not grow. To force the Japanese to spend, the Japanese government exerted itself, reduced the savings
rates, even charged the savers. Even then the Japanese did not spend (habits don't change, even with taxes, do they?). Their traditional postal savings alone is over $1.2 trillion. Thus, savings, far from being the strength of Japan, has become its pain.

Hence, what is the lesson?

That is, a nation cannot grow unless the people spend, not save. Not just spend, but borrow and spend.
Dr. Jagdish Bhagwati, the famous Indian-born economist in the US, told Manmohan Singh that Indians wastefully save. Ask them to spend, on imported cars and, seriously, even on cosmetics! This will put India on a growth curve. This is one of the reason for MNC's coming down to India, seeing the consumer spending.

'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue.'
But before you follow this Neo Economics, get some fools to save so that you can borrow from them and spend !!!

Some examples where credit ratings agencies have been disproven and discredited time and time again,14,7dskdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7dskdq/some_examples_where_credit_ratings_agencies_have/,9,1511036085.0,"Should Indian government really be celebrating? Here are some examples to think not - 

1.""In November 1998, the day after the Japanese Government announced a large-scale fiscal stimulus to its ailing economy, Moody’s Investors Service began the first of a series of downgradings of the Japanese Government’s yen-denominated bonds, by taking the Aaa (triple A) rating away. The next major Moody’s downgrade occurred on September 8, 2000.

Then, in December 2001, Moody’s further downgraded the Japan Governments yen-denominated bond rating to Aa3 from Aa2. On May 31, 2002, Moody’s Investors Service cut Japan’s long-term credit rating by a further two grades to A2, or below that given to Botswana, Chile and Hungary.

In a statement at the time, Moody’s said that its decision “reflects the conclusion that the Japanese government’s current and anticipated economic policies will be insufficient to prevent continued deterioration in Japan’s domestic debt position … Japan’s general government indebtedness, however measured, will approach levels unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed world, and as such Japan will be entering ‘uncharted territory’.”

The then Japanese Finance Minister responded (with some foresight): “They’re doing it for business. Just because they do such things we won’t change our policies … The market doesn’t seem to be paying attention.” Indeed, the Government continued to have no problems finding buyers for their debt, which is all yen-denominated and sold mainly to domestic investors. 
How … could a country that receives foreign aid from Japan have a better rating than Japan itself? Japan, with an economy almost 1,000 times the size of Botswana’s, has the world’s largest foreign reserves, $446 billion; the world’s largest domestic savings, $11.4 trillion; and about $1 trillion in overseas investments. And 95 percent of the debt is held by Japanese people 

In the New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/business/international-business-japan-battles-bond-rating.html] the logic of the rating was questioned:

2. Comment by formers President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and former member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Bob McTeer who is described as having “free-market views” which “gave the Dallas Fed its reputation during his tenure as “The Free-Enterprise Fed”” (Source). McTeer says:

    It may just be me, but aren’t the credit rating agencies supposed to be rating credit?

    Yesterday, we saw a sharp market reaction when one of the rating agencies that gave AAA ratings to mortgage-backed securities larded with subprime loans called into question the credit worthiness of Britain. As is the case with the United States and the Federal Reserve, Britain and its Bank of England have the ability to create new money if necessary to pay off its debt at maturity. There is no sovereign credit risk. There is no need for credit rating agencies to opine on the credit worthiness of sovereign debt.

    Sovereign debt is subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates in general rise, outstanding bonds, sovereign and non-sovereign, will decline in price, the extent depending on how close they are to maturity.

    Sovereign debt is also subject to inflation risk. Holders of the debt are harmed if inflation outpaces their expectations when they purchased the debt.

    When Standard & Poor questions British bonds, they must be making a judgment about some risk other than credit risk. Given time, investors will learn to take such questions with a grain of salt and not overreact. Meanwhile, haven’t they done enough harm for this cycle?""

4.""Ratings agencies admit mistakes - Credit rating agencies have admitted errors were made when assessing some of the financial instruments that have been blamed for the credit crunch.

Representatives of the three main agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch, Moodys - were grilled by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

They said that their assessment of securities backed by sub-prime mortgages turned out to be incorrect.

But they said these instruments were not too complex to rate accurately.

""The assumption that we made about how these assets would perform in the future turned out to be incorrect,"" said Ian Bell, head of European structured finance at Standard & Poor's.

Iceland role

Credit agencies carry out work to determine the worthiness or otherwise of financial investments.

They have been accused of failing to spot the size and risk of the bad US housing debt that was resold around the world, causing multi-billion-pound losses.

It was the discovery of these losses that caused the global credit markets to freeze up, and ultimately led to governments around the world having to bail out their banking sectors.

The ratings agencies said that credit ratings were just one factor that investors should look at when making investment decisions, but admitted that less sophisticated investors may have been over-reliant on their assessments.

The committee also criticised the agencies for failing to warn their clients adequately of the problems faced by the Icelandic economy before its banks collapsed last year.

Some 116 local councils deposited more than £858m in the failed banks, because they offered a relatively high return with a high credit rating.""

5.""Who's to Blame for the Economy? Rating Agencies - A good measure of who is responsible for getting us into this mess is looking at who got rich off of it. Bond ratings agencies certainly got their share of the take.

Moody's Investors Service ( MCO) saw its profits quadruple between 2000 and 2007 and had a higher profit margin than any other company in the S&P 500 for five straight years, according to opening statements from Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations, in a congressional hearing on the ratings agencies he held in October.""

The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC)[39] set up by the US Congress and President to investigate the causes of the crisis, and publisher of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (FCIR), concluded that the ""failures"" of the Big Three rating agencies were ""essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction"" and ""key enablers of the financial meltdown"".[40] It went on to say

    The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies. Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms.""

8. Moody's And Japan - But think about the Moodys statement in relation to Japan. The logic (and that is being kind) goes like this:

             1. Economic growth is low in Japan and is pushing tax revenue down and welfare spending up – hence the budget deficit rises.

              2. Given the Japanese government doesn’t exercise its legal right to spend without issuing debt to match the spending, the rising budget deficit (as a result of the cyclical downturn) also means rising public debt.

             3. Moodys asserts (with no analytical or conceptual basis provided) that these rising deficits are in some way a problem per se (rather than being a reflection of the real problem – slow growth).

            4. So in their Pavlovian fashion, they downgrade the credit rating presumably suggesting the Japanese government is a credit risk without acknowledging the Japanese government can never be an credit risk unless there is a collective brain explosion and the Government legislates to renege on its financial obligations.

            5. They downgrade because the slow growth makes it more difficult to reduce the budget deficit without acknowledging that the budget deficit should increase to meet the challenge of slow growth.

           6. But then you are left to ask two questions. First, the Moodys logic would suggest they want to increase the borrowing costs of the Japanese government by reducing the demand for bonds (because the lower rating is meant to scare investors) which if you believed their type of reasoning would further negatively impact on economic growth. So what sort of logic is that? Moodys (if you had their model outlook) is saying the Japanese economy is damaged because of the recession but we are going to make it worse and therefore worsen the problem of credit risk.

           7. Second, of-course, neither their implicit notion that Japanese government debt carries a credit risk or that their ratings change anything anyway are valid. Note that a sign that government paper was not an attractive investment prospect might be rising yields as investors avoided demanding the paper. But Moodys acknowledges that there is an “undiminished home bias of Japanese investors and their preference for government bonds, which allows the government’s fiscal deficits to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally”.

So who would you bet on? A corrupt capitalist firm that has made some monumental mistakes in the past while handing out AAA ratings to firms who were paying them to rate their products or millions of investors who every day purchase Japanese government debt at stable and the lowest yields? The same investors who have been buying Japanese government debt while deficits have been rising and public debt ratios heading up beyond 200 per cent (compared to the ridiculous Reinhardt Rogoff default threshold of 80 per cent) for the last 20 years.""

8. ""What mindless rule is being applied here?

The whole thing is mindless. To repeat, the logic appears to be: Cut deficits to keep the Aaa rating – but that would undermine growth and push up the deficit and debt – which undermines the Aaa rating.

And the politicians and everyone else goes along with this nonsense. We really are not a very bright race of people.""

Our Banks are in trouble & we need to talk about it,424,47ogw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/47ogw5/our_banks_are_in_trouble_we_need_to_talk_about_it/,93,1456511511.0,"Amidst the prolonged JNU controversy &amp; Jat Quota stir, one big development is constantly being ignored for the past two weeks. Our Banks (PSBs) have declared they have [4.4 lakh crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/at-rs-4-lakh-crore-bad-loans-exceed-market-value-of-psu-banks/articleshow/51078318.cms) worth Non Performing Assets (NPAs) as of December 2015. 

Here, I will attempt to break it all down in layman terms. What, why, when and how it affects us, the taxpayer. I'm no finance expert, so please point out any errors I make. I had to go through a lot of complicated jargon (it's weird how these things are always so complicated) to make sense of it.

**What are NPAs and why should we care?**

Loans whose three consecutive installments are not paid are classified as Non Performing Assets (NPAs). After an NPA or bad loan is declared, the bank can initiate the process of recovery and restructuring of that loan. It will try to get new management to run projects, auction off collateral and try to recover the amount, which is rarely equivalent to the amount of loan given. Especially in case of big loans. 

The NPAs that have been declared recently are mostly by big corporate borrowers (according to some sources, around 65-70% of total defaulters are big corps). Take the example of Vijay Mallaya. Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore. Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore. 

On top of it, [Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/budget/article-vijay-mallya-resigns-from-united-spirits-gets-rs-515-crore-1281435?pfrom=home-lateststories) and got a payout of ~~$515 million~~ Rs 515 crore. Good times for him while the 17 banks unitedly struggle to recover the loan amount. 

**So if the loans can't be recovered, what happens to the banks?** 

Simply put, they register losses, throw up their hands and tell the Government, ""Sorry [boss, can't get these loans back](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/state-run-banks-like-sbi-bank-of-baroda-central-bank-of-india-apprise-pm-narendra-modi-of-rising-bad-loans/articleshow/50990898.cms). We need to make profits. Pliss to help."" 

**What will the Government do about this?**

One word: Bailout. 
This whole thing is turning into a big cluster fuck. 'Sources' have been saying the government is planning to infuse Rs 70,000 crore till 2019 into PSBs to calm things down. They have already infused Rs 20,000 crore this year. This amount will not help banks deal with the problem in totality but it's a temporary measure to ensure they don't just collapse under the weight of NPAs. 

**Does that Government have enough money to save the banks?**

No. 

Here's a few things which the government has to spend on in the near future:

1) [Food Security Act](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-02-03/news/70313785_1_national-food-security-act-prime-minister-narendra-modi-food-subsidy) 

2) [MGNREGA](http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2016/02/nda-pursuing-mgnrega-bengal-and-up-election/)

3) [Seventh pay commission](http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/of-the-servants-by-the-servants-for-the-servants/)

5) [Increased Defence allocation](http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2016-17/expert-columns/defence-budget-allocation-likely-to-see-minimum-10-per-cent-hike/story/229336.html)

The revenue, on the other hand, doesn't seem that rosy. The government has [kept the fuel prices high](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/excise-duty-hiked-on-petrol-by-re-1litre-on-diesel-by-rs-1-5/) to get excise duty on it. The finance minister has been saying this is being done to reduce our fiscal deficit, which is fair. But then in that case where will the money for 'capital infusion in banks' come from? 

(I have to point out here that the first two expenditure items I mentioned are something that the present government has avoided spending on much till now. I don't blame them because the GST plan didn't really work out, so they have to go on an appeasement spree to calm their voters.)

**Well, that's all dandy well awesome but who's fault is it?**

This problem, unfortunately, cannot be pinned down on a single person or party. So I've made a list! 

1) *Raghuram Rajan / Reserve Bank of India*

The banks have been more or less forced to declare these loans because Raghuram Rajan sent notices telling them to clean up their balance sheets. He did this so that the banks can start a fresh cycle of loan disbursements to boost investment in the country. It's a good move in the long term but it all depends on whether the banks are in a position to handle the burden at this point of time.

A Supreme Court bench recently [pulled up the RBI to ask WTF is happening](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-debts-rbi-supreme-court-bank-defaulters/). 

&gt; The bench headed by Chief Justice asked, ""People are owing thousands of crore to the public banks… it is a big fraud. Top ten public sector banks have written off Rs 40,000 crore alone in 2015. It is all there in this Indian Express report. Public financial institutions are lending money despite knowing no returns. RBI is supposed to keep a watch on these banks. What are you doing about it?”

They asked RBI to submit a list of defaulters with loans over Rs 500 crore. To which the RBI replied:

&gt; “The required information is not available with us. Banks are required to report the bad loans on a consolidated basis.""

Personally, I find this response really strange because a periodic reporting of big loans is done to both the Finance Ministry and RBI. How can they ask the banks to ~~waive off~~ write-off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of who the big defaulters are? 

*2) Manmohan Singh / Previous UPA Government*

If anyone is to blame, it's them. These loans which are being declared NPAs have been given during their time. They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money, but they didn't. So they have left this huge crumbling mass of debt which is all coming out. Like pus from a wound. Ugh.

*3) Narendra Modi / Present NDA Government*

If this capital infusion a.k.a. bailout continues and the economy gets in trouble, the NDA government will be definitely blamed for it. The whole point is that they are now in power and they have to clean up the mess even if they want to blame the previous government for it. The people will not forgive the BJP for a major (possibly catastrophic) economic downturn, no matter who is responsible for it. 

Modi has projected himself, right from the beginning, as the savior of the economy. Now that the economy is facing a challenge, he can't afford to point fingers at UPA. But he will, he most definitely will. Rightfully so, but that won't help matters at all.

*4) Faceless, nameless / The Banks*

Aah yes. These frikkin Bankers. The biggest culprits are the bank managers who are responsible for due diligence before disbursing loans. If there is an NPA in a particular bank branch, the manager is held responsible for it. In case of big loans, the top management has to give approvals and they are also held responsible. 

Through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft, the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans. They didn't have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in. Until Rajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loans. 

*5) Big Corporates*

The usual suspects. They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts. Just like Vijay Mallya did. They have, in the past decade or so, taken a lot of loans which are now proving to be bad assets for the banks. Even the Economic survey has pointed out that these [corporate debts are worrisome](http://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/perspective/economic-survey-corporate-debts-consumer-spend-monsoons/story/229607.html). They have called it 'The Twin Balance Sheet Problem'... which makes no sense to me...

Some projects haven't taken off due to land acquisition issues, Infrastructure problems and environmental clearances. There is limited investment coming in from abroad. Therefore, the government was eager to push GST and all of these investment driving schemes for the past two years. Didn't really work out as they planned. Even if they manage to pave the way for these pending projects, the corporations are known to delay and milk them for maximum profits. (Eg: KG Basin, IGI Airport and many more.) 

**So what happens next? Also, TLDR.**

To put it simply: The taxpayer gets f'ed in the a. As always.

Last Week in the Indian Parliament #2 (May 02 to May 06),369,4it1ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4it1ef/last_week_in_the_indian_parliament_2_may_02_to/,68,1462965769.0,"Hello /r/India!

I bring you the second edition of Last Week in the Indian Parliament! I got a lot of feedback last time and people insisted I keep it more narrative based. I shall do so but I have also included briefs from PRS in the end for the legislative business transacted during the week. 

Boy do I have stories for you today!

Last week, a Rajya Sabha member was suspended for a day for making ‘unauthorised inane noise’; a controversial amendment was passed which allows foreign funding for political parties; the government of the day tactfully avoided being embarrassed by a new ‘Jumla’; and Big Tobacco fought the Government with Zero Hour Notices.

Let’s get right into it!

___
#Money Bill strikes again!
___
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a troubled lot. They have an easy majority in Lok Sabha, which allows them to push their bills through, but they don’t have the numbers in Rajya Sabha to do the same. For the past two years, the opposition in the upper house has blocked their legislative agenda through the creative use of their throats and by camping all around the speaker’s grand throne-chair, protesting away to glory. But the Government of the day seems to have a few tricks up its sleeve. They seem to be aiming to completely ignore the upper house by using the [Money Bill route](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/492acw/lets_talk_about_the_new_aadhaar_bill_it_can/). Twice!


The first instance of ‘Operation Money Bill’ was observed on March 11, when the Lok Sabha passed the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016. During the consideration of this bill, many members screamed bloody murder and opposed this legislation being certified as a Money Bill. It went to the Rajya Sabha for recommendations. The bill got passed, 4 days later, on March 16 in its original form. The government of the day seems to have hit Parliament procedure gold. So merely two months later, they decided to do it again.

And this time, it was to bring in FDI in politics!

The Finance Bill 2016 was passed in the Lok Sabha with a clause that did not belong in that legislation, namely, amendments the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA).

___
#BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players
___

The FCRA Amendment is a strange one. Earlier foreign companies were not allowed to make donations to political parties. For obvious reasons. Otherwise entities like Monsanto [would have a field day](http://imgur.com/AsZqfLk). 

The logic being that foreign entities should not be able to influence our Parliament to make laws that favor them. In 2014, both BJP and Congress were found guilty by the Delhi High Court of accepting foreign contributions from UK based company Vedanta. So the government of the day decided to deal with it by making a retrospective amendment to the FCRA act by hiding it within the Finance Bill.

This amendment has cleared Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha has no say in it (because, you know, ‘Operation Money Bill’) and the President’s approval will come soon. Say hello to FDI in Politics.

___
#The Curious Case of Finance Bill, 2016
___
During the debate on the Finance Bill on Wednesday, Asaduddin Owaisi raised a point of order to question the government on the validity of the FCRA amendment. He argued that this act comes under the Home Ministry and amending it through a Finance Bill goes against the provisions of the Constitution. He demanded that the discussion should be suspended immediately since the bill is flawed. 

The decision landed on the lap of deputy speaker of Lok Sabha Arjun Charan Singh, who looked like a dog-lover with a cat in his lap. Unsure what to do. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was away on an official visit to Germany so MoS Jayant Sinha tried to do a [ninja save](http://imgur.com/G9lMcPM). He told Owaisi that Jaitley will respond to his query while replying to the debate.

**[24 hours later](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/e/e8/24_Hours_Later..._.png/revision/latest?cb=20130519222728)**

While giving his reply speech, the Fin Min sort of ignored the FCRA issue. Instead, he spoke about giving funds to the Polavaram Dam. It upset Biju Janata Dal from Orissa enough to stage a rather noisy walkout. The debate ended abruptly and clause by clause on the Finance Bill began. 

Still no word about the point of order despite Owaisi asking the speaker for a ruling.

[Cricket sounds #1](http://imgur.com/DKiZ6Mw)

The Finance Minister had made 49 official amendments to the Finance Bill, so the speaker was going through them one by one. Clause 233, which concerns the controversial FCRA amendment, was clubbed in with Clauses 220 to 230, schedules first to fifteen and passed together.

[Cricket sounds #2](http://imgur.com/wn6P3Mv)

After the clause by clause consideration was completed, the speaker gave a ruling to Owaisi’s point of order and denied it. Ignoring protests from some members, she called for the passage of the bill.

[Cricket sounds #3](http://imgur.com/JxBvCE6)

Not a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha. 

The Finance Minister be like [#EpicWin](http://img.memecdn.com/epic-win_o_834502.gif).

#The ‘Jumla’ that escaped
___
Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad raised the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) issue in Rajya Sabha. Jairam Ramesh has written about this extensively in The Hindu ( [Part 1](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/jairam-ramesh-on-the-krishna-godavari-basin-scam/article8486493.ece) & [Part 2](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-article-by-jairam-ramesh-on-the-kg-basin-scam-part-ii/article8533360.ece) ). 
To give you a short rundown of this ‘Jumla’, in 2005 GSPC claimed that the KG Basin had an epic deposit of natural gas worth an estimated Rs. 2,20,000 crore. They spent Rs 19,700 crore over a period of a decade for ‘gas exploration’ but did not get even a tiny whiff of the sweet sweet hydrocarbon gas mixture. Five CAG reports over the past five years have pointed out discrepancies in the way GSPC operated. The Congress has been dying to dig deep into this issue and they finally did it in Rajya Sabha. They took out their shovels, ready to break the earth while singing merry songs of victory.

But then, they struck a rock called Arun Jaitley even before they started digging.

Jaitley told Azad that this issue cannot be raised in Parliament because the [Public Accounts Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee_(India) (PAC) is already examining it. The PAC is a committee of selected members of Parliament, constituted by the Parliament of India, for the auditing of the revenue and the expenditure of the Government of India. The house cannot deliberate on matters that a Parliamentary committee is already deliberating. 

___
#Rule 255: Kick the disrupter
___
Rajya Sabha was yet again disrupted at the beginning of the week over the Agusta Westland issue. Members trooped into the well, shouting garbled slogans against the Government. Then, Rule 255 happened. 

> “The Chairman may direct any member whose conduct is in his opinion grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from the Council and any member so ordered to withdraw shall do so forthwith and shall absent himself during the remainder of the day's meeting.” [Source](http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rs_rule/generalrulesproc.asp)

Hamid Ansari, Chairman of Rajya Sabha invoked this rule and ordered Sukhendu Roy of the TMC to be removed from the upper house for a day. Roy was seen standing at his seat and demanding (very loudly) to know who benefitted from the Agusta Westland scam. 

Here’s an excerpt from the debate:

[""Please stop making inane noise""](http://imgur.com/JQhbrjq)

[""Please stop talking... or else""](http://imgur.com/vl0UVaB)

[""RULE 255 BITCHES!!! GTFO!""](http://imgur.com/v3kMrpA)

After the Sukhendu Roy left, taking his ‘unauthorized inane noise’ with him, the Congress continued its valiant attempt to stall the proceedings in the house. Nitin Gadkari, visibly upset, requested Ansari to smite them with his awesome legal powers and invoke 255 on all of them. Ansari pointed out that Rule 255 applies only to individual members and cannot be enforced en masse.

[Obama... I mean... Ansari out!](http://giphy.com/gifs/obama-mic-drop-out-3o7qDLkrKr034Z3hQI)

#Big Tobacco vs Unhealthy Lung pictures
___
There have been three zero hour notices raised in the Lok Sabha this session regarding increasing health warnings on tobacco products to 85%. To give you some context, the government had passed an order in 2014 which mandated tobacco manufacturers to show gruesome pictures of decaying lungs that cover up to 85% of the product packet. 

The pictures would dissuade new smokers from taking up the deadly cause and it has been proven to be quite effective in many countries around the world. This order was to come into force on April 1 this year and there has been a battle raging between the Tobacco industry and the government on the sidelines. /u/dextermilburn has been talking about ITC shutting down and opening factories [in his posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4inj30/last_week_in_indian_economy_for_the_week_ending/) for a few weeks now. The Parliament also became a stage where this battle is being fought by filing notices in favor and against the government’s move.

Last week on May 3rd, Baijayant Panda raised a zero hour notice supporting the government’s move to increase the warning size. He urged the government to hold its ground on increasing health warnings and to implement its order diligently. 

On 27th April, two other members had raised a notice to oppose the government’s move, namely R Dhruvanarayana and Sharadkumar Bansode. Both of these members spoke about how tobacco farmers and beedi manufacturers will be adversely affected if these warnings are imposed. They wanted the government to consider the plight of the farmers connected to the industry and not impose the order.

Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court had a hearing where upheld the Government’s 2014 order and asked Tobacco companies to implement it.

**What is a Zero Hour and why is it important?**

‘Zero Hour’ refers to a time period in the Parliament when members can raise matters of urgent public importance to bring it to the notice of the government of the day. Every day when the Parliament is in session, there is one hour allotted to raise such notices. A member is required to file the notice in Parliament before 9 a.m. on the same day. A ballot takes place in which notices are randomly selected and are allowed to be raised. In Lok Sabha, the Zero hour usually happens from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and in Rajya Sabha, it happens from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. It’s upto the speakers in both houses to decide the time slot of the zero hour, depending on how heavy the legislative business is.

The Zero hour is easily one of the most ignored aspect of our Parliamentary process. It a perfect way to judge what is on the minds of our elected representatives. For instance, in the past two weeks numerous notices were raised on the water crisis and drought situation in the country. Considering that these notices are randomly selected through a ballot, the sheer volume points towards the fact that this crisis is bigger and badder than we imagine.

5 reasons why layoff in India can be especially hard ?,31,6cfxc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6cfxc8/5_reasons_why_layoff_in_india_can_be_especially/,21,1495392186.0,"""Top 5 reasons why layoff in India can be especially hard"" 

Do you agree? 

1. Social stigma: The middle-class in India attaches a lot of ‘status’ to what one does for a living. Among the first questions one gets asked during introductions include “where do you work?” (or “Where does your husband work?”). “He used to work for Infosys and just got laid-off” doesn’t cut it.  

2. Identity and self-worth: Typical middle-class kids are conditioned to work hard to succeed. When one is laid-off due to factors beyond one’s control (‘business reasons’) one begins to question one’s basic values. 

3. Pressure from relatives: Those from an earlier generation – parents, uncles and relatives of IT workers – equate ‘layoff’ to ‘firing.’ Right after layoff, they may begin to gossip “Ramesh was fired by Wipro. I though he was doing well there. What did he do wrong?” 

4. Financial challenges : Many IT workers over-leveraged their finances by “Investing” in expensive, upscale apartments, houses, cars and white-goods with large EMIs and credit card payments. Sudden stoppage of a paycheck can certainly be hard. 

5. Other practical challenges:  Many of those who are being laid-off are single and in their twenties and early thirties. Until recently, an ‘IT groom’ with a nice paycheck was a prime-catch in the matrimonial market. All the news of doom-and-gloom in IT sector is perhaps making families with eligible brides and grooms re-think alliances from those in IT sector.

**The Good News: Inflation**

Do you hear that sound? That’s the sound of retail stores in India reducing their prices to a 3 month low. After rising for five straight months, retail inflation in February came down to 5.18%. This has been [attributed](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-14/news/71509641_1_retail-inflation-price-rise-pulses) largely to a fall in the prices of vegetables, pulses and fruits. While cereal prices remained the same, the dark lining is that prices of eggs shot up significantly. Time to substitute omelets with salads, perhaps? But that’s just the retail end of business. Coming to the wholesale side of business, inflation in wholesale prices fell for the 16th straight month and remained [negative](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Decline-in-inflation-on-expected-line-Finanace-ministry/articleshow/51400780.cms) at -0.91%. The data comes from the Consumer and Wholesale Price Indices, which track retail and wholesale prices around the country.


**The Bad News: Foreign Trade**

Not to harsh your mellow, but stop rejoicing over the good news for a second and hear this. India’s February Exports decreased by 5.66%. If you haven’t been following the export numbers, and no one can blame you for that, this is the 15th consecutive month in which exports have [decreased](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/rfZrfTFsUFMVWkTXV8wEAK/Indias-February-trade-deficit-narrows-to-65-billion.html). Petroleum products was the dark swan as exports of gasoline, jet fuel etc. fell by 28%. The golden goose of the bunch was jewellery as exports of shiny rings and necklaces increased by 11%. Just to give you some perspective, our brothers to the north, the Chinese saw their exports fall by 25%. On the flip side, India’s imports also decreased by 5.03%. You win some, you lose some, right? 


**Rajya Sabha Feels Betrayed**

Giving statutory backing to the unique identity number system, the Lok Sabha this week has passed the [Aadhaar Bill](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lok-sabha-passes-aadhaar-bill/article8361467.ece?homepage=true). This newly passed bill is a significant instrument for the government’s Direct Transfer Benefits scheme for better targeting of subsidies. The argument against it was that it violated the Supreme Court order that said an Aadhaar Card cannot be mandatory but only voluntary. Now, if you remember your 7th standard civics syllabus, both houses of the parliament, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, have to pass a bill for it to become a law. What your 7th standard civics textbook probably didn’t mention is the Rajya Sabha has no say in the matter if a specific bill is categorized as a “money bill”. Which is exactly what Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who piloted the Aadhaar bill through parliament, did so that it can bypass the Rajya Sabha where Jaitley’s BJP does not have a majority. One can only imagine how emotionally hurt the Rajya Sabha was when the Lok Sabha went behind its back to pass the Aadhaar Bill. 

**It’s Raining Black Gold: Sweet, Sweet Oil**

“Tass-Yurikah” sounds like an Urdu swear word, but it’s actually the name of a Russian oil field. Soon enough, it won’t even be entirely Russian anymore. A group of Indian oil companies signed a deal with Rosneft, the Russian oil company that owns [Tass-Yurikah](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ongc-videsh-ltd-ioc-consortium-to-buy-russian-oil-fields-for-4-2-billion/articleshow/51427860.cms), to buy a 29.9% stake in the oilfield for $1.28 billion (₹8,505 crore). This puts the Indians in partnership with the British oil major BP who owns 20% while the remaining 50.1% is still owned by Rosneft. Deals to explore a possible stake sale in Vankor, another Russian oilfield, were also signed. This comes at a time when global oil prices are falling off a cliff, just like BJP’s poll numbers in that [recent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_Legislative_Assembly_election,_2015) Bihar election. This also comes at a time when Russia’s economy is suffering from an acute case of international sanctions that were imposed on Russia after they snatched Crimea from Ukraine, just like the JD(U) snatched seats from BJP in that recent Bihar election. Too political? Thought so. Meanwhile, they just [hiked](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/economy/article-petrol-price-hiked-by-rs-3-07-litre-diesel-by-rs-1-90-litre-1287407) petrol and diesel prices by 3.07/litre and 1.07/litre.

**Ban on 344 Illegal Drugs**

The government is playing the game that everyone knows it excels at - banning things. This time around, the health ministry has issued a ban on over [344 drugs](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/health-ministry-bans-344-fixed-dose-combination-drugs-1286977). No, not the one’s that make you hallucinate or see sounds and hear colours, but the one’s that are pharmaceutical. Known as “combination drugs”, these drugs combine two or more drugs together so the patient only has to pop one pill instead of three. Technically, they were being sold illegally since none of them had approval from the central government, but had entered markets nevertheless after receiving blessings from only the state governments. At least this time around, the bans make more sense. Cough syrup Corex and the famous Vicks Action 500 were among the 344 substances banned. However, the Delhi High Court reversed the ban on [Corex](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/corporates/article-corex-popular-cough-syrup-not-banned-for-now-says-court-1287076?ndtv_related) and is set to hear the case on March 21st after Pfizer ([PFIZER](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3APFIZER&ei=uk_vVqjdIoSVjAGihJ_IBw)), the company that makes Corex, sent lawyers marching down to the Court right away. Feeling a bit jealous of Pfizer, 21 other pharmaceutical companies, including P&G India ([PGHH](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3APGHH&ei=tk_vVsGTOJPwjAGTuZQg)), the maker of [Vicks](http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/hc-relief-for-14-more-drug-firms/210246.html), also managed to convince the court to reverse bans placed on their drugs as well.

**Make Room for One More Tax**

You know how countries sometimes impose tariffs on foreign goods to make domestic players competitive? Well, states across India such as Uttarakhand, Bihar and Assam seem to have forgotten that they are not independent countries but merely states within one. It’s okay, we all go through an identity crisis at some point. Lawmakers in those states have imposed an “[entry tax](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-15/news/71543125_1_entry-tax-goods-services-tax-levy)” on e-commerce websites for selling products that were not made in those states - which sounds eerily similar to tariffs imposed by sovereign nations. What could make this worse? Almost half a dozen other states are also considering imposing a similar tax on e-commerce goods sold inside the state that were manufactured outside the state. If this goes through, you might have to foot the bill for your state’s poor manufacturing as online retailers pass these taxes on to the customer. Also, the grapevine has it that Amazon offered to acquire Flipkart for [$8 billion](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Flipkart-and-Amazon-may-have-explored-sale-talks-say-sources/articleshow/51421374.cms) (₹53,160 crore) last year, but the deal fell through. Make of that what you will.

**27 Banks today = 6 Banks Tomorrow**

Strength in unity is the chant on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s mind as a new expert committee was set up to explore possible [bank mergers](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-govt-may-form-6-stong-banks-from-merger-of-27-psbs-to-tackle-rising-bad-loan-issue-2186336) to bring down the number of state-run banks in India from 27 today to just 6 in the future. And with the bad loans crisis looming over the banking industry, strength is just what the doctor prescribed. Apparently, since public sector banks are already short-staffed, bank employees don’t have to worry about downsizing in case any of these mergers actually happen. Words of caution, however: Too big to fail?

**IIP: Third Time’s (not) the Charm**

For the third month in a row, [industrial production](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/G1Hs0uma1LuBdMLkYpQlFL/Indias-IIP-contracts-15-in-January-third-month-in-a-row.html) in India went down. The numbers for the month of January released just recently by the Central Statistical Organization don’t look good - a 1.5% drop in industrial production, that’s against a 1.2% drop in December and a 3.2% drop in November. That is bad with a capital B. Silver lining on the cloud that’s raining on everyone’s parade? Mining and Electricity sectors grew by 1.2% and 6.6% in January respectively. Raghuram Rajan, the main god that economists around the country worship who also moonlights as the Governor of RBI, has called the numbers “disappointing” while stating that though the economy is in recovery, the process is volatile.

**Housing For All by 2022**

So you thought Swachh Bharat was Prime Minister Modi’s only pet project? Then you haven’t heard about the Housing For All initiative under which the PM aims to provide homes for all Indian families by 2022. The country inched a step closer to that goal when the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament, passed a landmark bill seeking to regulate the [Real Estate](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-realestate-regulations-parliament-idINKCN0WC1DJ) sector to bring more transparency and protect consumer interests. And this bill.. get this, was passed by bipartisan support as even the Congress came out of the woodwork to extend its support. Now when was the last time you heard about the ruling and the opposition party coming together and working to pass important legislation? Almost makes you wonder if they are.. [up to something](https://j.gifs.com/v29nEn.gif).

**Not Happening: EPF Tax**

The government has suddenly become very sensitive to any kind of backlash as was apparent when Arun Jaitley announced that a key budget proposal to tax withdrawals from EPF exceeding 40% of total investment would be rolled back. The proposal led to controversy among the small but vocal professional class who viewed it as a tax on the hard-working middle-class employees, and thus was promptly [shot down](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-pensions-epf-tax-withdraw-jaitley-idINKCN0WB0BE). Might it have anything to do with the not one, not two, not three, but five states holding elections in April and May? With politics, you can be sure that the elections have a big role in.. really everything that politicians do or don’t do. 

**Vijay Mallya Just Can’t Win**

It’s hard to empathize with the problems of rich billionaires, but poor Mallya just can’t seem to catch a break. A debt recovery tribunal in Bengaluru has [cash blocked](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-barred-from-accessing-rs-515-crore-severance-pay-1284719) Vijay Mallya by halting the $75 million (₹515 crore) payment he was set to receive as settlement from Diageo plc., the largest shareholder in Mallya’s United Spirits Ltd. ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=yRjmVsGsBsWd2Aas8ovwBg)). Later, a bunch of banks ganged up on him as they seized [trademarks](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-mallya-idUSKCN0WC184) related to the now defunct Kingfisher Airlines, trademarks such as “Kingfisher”, “Flying Models” and “King of Good Times”. And then came the accusations that Mallya has fled the country, which led to the banks asking a court to return and impound his passport. Moral of the story: Kids, never borrow $1.4 billion to run a flashy airliner when you can’t repay it. Especially when you already own a successful liquor company.

**Ambani vs. Netflix**

Mukesh Ambani has decided that there is no way Netflix can just waltz into India and lay claim to his homeground without facing any competition. Not one to keep his hands off any pie, he is reportedly entering the country’s cable TV sector through his latest venture called RJio. Ambani’s Reliance Industries ([RELIANCE](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ARELIANCE&ei=DBnmVsG4Atf3jAHklKf4DA)) which already owns TV channels like CNBC, Colors, ETV and many more is planning to spend about $2 billion (₹13,403 crore) over the next three years to capture 20 million TV subscribers. One of the offerings in store from RJio is [Jio Play](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-reliance-cable-tv-idUSKCN0W92J4), a movie and TV series streaming service, in short, it’s version of Netflix. India being a massive entertainment market, Netflix probably isn’t going to watch this from the sidelines. Grab the popcorn, this movie just might get interesting.

**RBI Drops Rates Like They’re Hot**

After four interest rate decreases in the past one year, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates by 0.25% again to a more than [5-year](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-repo-rates-decision-idINKCN0X20C1) low of 6.5%. This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy.


**Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol**

Heartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever. The state has decided to go the route of Gujarat, Nagaland and Manipur to completely ban all sales of [alcohol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales) (you didn’t know it was banned in Nagaland and Manipur as well, did you?). The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company.

**One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure**

Indian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress? Only time will tell.

**Are Diamonds Forever?**

That’s the question the government is asking itself as it prepares to end its legal monopoly over diamond mining in India. After the first ever auction of a gold mine in February, which was won by Vedanta Ltd. ([VEDL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AVEDL&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), India is gearing up to do the same again and auction its first [ever](http://www.vccircle.com/news/infrastructure/2016/04/05/after-gold-india-set-its-first-diamond-mine-auction) diamond mine. The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.

**Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers**

In Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well. For Amitabh Bachchan though, this just negates all the good PR that the *do boond zindagi ke* polio campaign brought him. As for you, see if you can even point to where Panama is on a globe.

Last week in the Indian Parliament #3 (May 09 to May 13),192,4jko0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4jko0k/last_week_in_the_indian_parliament_3_may_09_to/,37,1463425931.0,"I have good news! 

The Lok Sabha functioned without even a *single minute* of adjournment during business. This was only the third session in the history of the universe when a Lok Sabha session functioned oh-so-smoothly. 

I will let the Speaker of the House Sumitra Mahajan explain it:

[ZERO ADJOURMENTS PEEPAL!](http://imgur.com/CNmZHO9)

Hello /r/India,

In this edition of Last Week in Indian Parliament, we talk about the great ‘Pillar Fight’; quorum of the house and the absence of it; and how Rajya Sabha turned into a nukkad Ganpati Utsav culture day. 

I also wanted to write about: ""The Enforcement of Security Interest and (*takes a deep breath*) Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions (AMENDMENT) Bill, 2016 to amend the Securitisation and (*takes another deep breath*) Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 a.k.a the SARFAESI Act""

But then I realized it requires a whole new post.

So let's get right into it!

___

#“Hon’ble Members…”

#“Absent, Madam.”
___

The Budget session adjourned sine-dine on Friday for Rajya Sabha and on Wednesday for Lok Sabha. I can’t even count how many times during this session I heard the quorum bell ringing shrill, begging the members to come inside the house and let the business continue.

For the uninitiated, quorum is the minimum number of members that have to be present for the business in the house to be conducted. Under article 100(3) of the Constitution, for both houses of Parliament and State Assemblies, the quorum is one-tenth of the total strength of the house. So basically, in Lok Sabha, 53 members need to be present in order to let the house function.

Here’s the funny thing though, the quorum is considered only if a member present in the house brings it to the notice of the speaker. There is a certain ‘young’ Congress MP who can be spotted constantly counting the number of members present (I can’t name this person, for obvious reasons). The moment he sees that the members are below 53, he screams, “MADAMMMM! QUORUMMMM!?” 

Then he sits back with a smirk on his face as the speaker sighs, halts the business and the quorum bell rings.

**Fun fact**: There are two different sounding (and extremely shrill) quorum bells for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. They can be heard throughout the premises and all conversations are cut short. There are separate sounding bells for division of the house calls too. The members are supposed to rush into the house when these bells ring. Super irritating, if you ask me. If it were upto me, I would use the following as quorum bells:

[Lok Sabha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W2jONIjrM0)

[Rajya Sabha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg)

**Fun Fact 2:** The Quorum bell was rung when the Finance Bill and Aadhaar Bill were being considered. It was rung multiple times when the debate on Water Crisis was underway. Gives you an idea about the state of affairs.

**Why was the Lok Sabha adjourned early?**

Because the government didn’t seem to have any legislative business left. The Lok Sabha was supposed to continue till May 13, but was shut down on May 11. 

After the Uttarakhand Appropriation bill was passed, there was nothing left to do. So, as an afterthought, the discussion on drought and water crisis continued for two days. Since the session is coinciding with five state elections, a lot of members were absent from the house. I don’t recall AIADMK MPs participating even in a single debate this session. So basically, maintaining quorum was becoming a big issue and probably that’s why they decided to adjourn Lok Sabha early.

#Pillar Fight!
___

There has been a silent battle raging between our Judiciary, Legislature and Executive. In the past one month, there are many seemingly disconnected events that happened, but if you look closer you will see a tiny silk thread running through them all. Last week, during a debate on Uttarakhand appropriating bill, the Pillar Fight came to the forefront. The story is quite convoluted, so hold on to your [tin-foil hats](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/69852/3449330-tumblr_loq5o7rd4n1qzl8s1o1_400.gif)!

**The Battle of Uttarakhand**

The Uttarakhand ‘crisis’ came to a conclusion last week after Harish Rawat won the floor test, got on to his horse and [galloped away into the sunset](https://67.media.tumblr.com/ff9fd687b5bb1a3256eef3428074b7bb/tumblr_nytqw4xu7G1u9i37so1_400.gif). The floor test was ordered by the Supreme Court and it was to take place without the speaker of the 70 member assembly conducting it. The whole hand-raising ceremony was recorded and the video was sent to SC for verification. News Channels were showing Rawat praying to god almighty for saving his seat and, in the process, getting a lot of sympathy from his voters.

(**PERSONAL POLITICAL COMMENT:** I won’t be surprised if, come February, he goes around the state, addressing election rallies and screaming “MODI TRIED TO CONQUER US! BUT WE FRIKKIN WON!!” The ‘outsider invaded our land’ pitch can be quite compelling. Remember Independence Day? No no, not the Indian Freedom Struggle, I was talking about the movie where aliens attack and humans win and then everyone makes out in the end and are all happy and shit. Same thing. So, well done BJP!)


**Uttarakhand Appropriation Bill, 2016** 

>“Speaker is the roxxx. He/she is Supreme”

>~ Indian National Congress


Before the crucial floor test happened on Tuesday, the government of the day seemed to be in a weird sort of hurry to get the state’s budget passed in Parliament on Monday. I’m yet to figure out why but the Finance Minister, in his opening statement, said that this was being passed so that the state can continue with its expenditure for the next four months. He said, if the budget is not passed by the Assembly, the state won’t be allowed to spend any money.

[Jaitley Logic](http://imgur.com/RCstARp)

The president’s rule (under Rule 356) was imposed on Uttarakhand on 27th March 2016, a day before the floor test was supposed to happen. Since then, the assembly has been in a state of ‘suspended animation’. The central government was of the opinion that the Speaker of the Uttarakhand Assembly did not conduct the house as per the book, that he let the state budget pass even though the Uttarakhand Government didn’t have the required votes.

[What if the Speaker is being a complete ass?](http://imgur.com/rX785ih)

Members of INC argued here that the speaker (Pillar of Legislature) has a right to conduct the house as he/she pleases. They also held the belief that the Court (Pillar of Judiciary) has a right to question the decision of the President (Pillar of Executive) too. On, 21st April, the Nainital High Court had scrapped the President’s Rule in Uttarakhand, thus challenging the President. 

**Aadhaar Bill, 2016**

> “Speaker is the suxxx. He/she is NOT Supreme.”

> ~ Indian National Congress

Now here's the weird part. 

Incidentally, in case of the Aadhaar Bill, 2016, the Indian National Congress has challenged the Lok Sabha Speaker’s decision to classify the Aadhaar Bill as a money bill. Jairam Ramesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court, the hearing for which is scheduled soon. I have been talking about this case for a while now, so you can read more about it [here](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking).

In this case, INC has argued that the speaker (Pillar of Legislature) is *not* supreme and her decision can be challenged by the Court (Pillar of Judiciary). 

I know I know. It’s utterly confusing. It’s also rather amusing how INC can speak in favour *and* against the same bloody thing. Takes some talent to pull it off.

**So which pillar wins?**

Zoom out a little. 

Imagine these three pillars, side by side. 

The height of the Legislative Pillar is decided by a party’s strength in the Parliament. At the moment, the Pillar of Legislature is standing tall (#MudiRoxx). As with the case with every party in power at the center, they try to find ways and means to infringe and cut down the powers of the other two pillars. 

*In the case of Uttarakhand Assembly*, Legislature was taken over by Executive and both of these pillars were shot down by the Judiciary.

*In the case of Aadhaar Bill*, the Judiciary is challenging the Legislature by questioning its highest functionary, the speaker. Since the Bill has been assented to by the President, they also end up challenging the Executive. If the SC rules that Aadhaar is #NotAMoneyBill and strike it down, it gives a decision against the Executive too.

This battle was underlined by Arun Jaitley with a singular suggestion to the Speaker of Lok Sabha, that if the Supreme Court summons her in the Aadhaar case: **She should ignore them!**

[Madam Speaker, ignore. Just ignore.](http://imgur.com/Lf89cDo)

[Obligatory song dedicated to Mr Jaitley](https://youtu.be/1M8vei3L0L8?t=26s)

The Pillar Fight rages on and much popcorn has been consumed in the process. I am single-handedly making Act II profitable.

I leave you with an interesting comment made by Kalikesh Singh Deo during the Uttarakhand debate:

#Rajya Sabha Association prijhents “Bye Bye Honourable Members Mohatsav”
___

53 members retired from the Rajya Sabha last week after serving 6 years in the house, being awesome and stuff. Prime Minister Modi gave a [farewell speech] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k-HZIMs9xc) on the occasion, which is worth giving a watch (HINDI ALERT).

Before you go further, let me say, **“No. The BJP will not get majority in the Rajya Sabha by 2019.”**

[Here’s a good article explaining why](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/in-this-term-modi-govt-will-never-have-the-numbers-in-rajya-sabha/)
___
**Psst... Umm… Noob question: How are Rajya Sabha Members elected?**

*Don’t be embarrassed if you don’t know! Let me give you a simple rundown of how this whole shindig works. If you already know, feel free to skip this part.*

To put it simply, Rajya Sabha (aka State Council) Members are elected by the people you elect for state assemblies. There is a proportional voting system in place which decides how many members from different political parties will represent a state in the upper house. 

IRL, the party boss decides who gets a Rajya Sabha ticket. The majority political party in the assembly gets to send more members than other parties. The number of RS seats per state are decided according to the population of the state. A member elected for Rajya Sabha serves a term of six years.

The Rajya Sabha, unlike the Lok Sabha, is *never* dissolved. 1/3rd Members of RS resign every two years making the house a perpetual entity. [Here](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/memberstatewise.aspx) is a list of the seats held by each state, present vacancies and other such details.
___

The Rajya Sabha bid a tearful adieu to retiring members who were given a chance to express their emotions. They did express their emotions and how! I have done the painstaking job of going through the debates and pulling out interesting bits which turned the Rajya Sabha into a *nukkad sabha*. 

Much fun was had!

*(Most of this was in Hindi, so for the benefit of my non-hindi speaking [comarades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NJbxEgf3Uo), I will try to translate it in a crude manner.)*

- Ram Gopal Yadav (Samajwadi Party) [recalled an anecdote](http://imgur.com/qjtuXlz): Two American politicians were sitting together discussing the relevance of the Senate (Upper House). The Senator amongst them was sipping tea, he simply blew on the tea and looked back at the other. “What does this mean?” asked the noob amongst the two. The Senator replied, “The Upper house cools down the decisions taken by the lower house. It’s like cooling tea so you don’t burn your tongue.”

- SS Roy (Trinamool Congress) [broke into a Mukesh song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDbwkKDWJ-4), explaining (in poetic terms) how members of Rajya Sabha will come back if the High Command wishes them to do so.

- Chandan Mitra (Bharatiya Janata Party) [recalled the lines of Faiz Ahmed Faiz](http://imgur.com/mUekcBY):

>“You know and I know,

> Both of our paths separate today,

> Even if you travel far, do remember me,

> Never say goodbye, Never say goodbye.”

- Dr KP Ramalingam (AIADMK) [quoted from Thirukkural](http://imgur.com/vFrXBVG), an ancient Tamil epic.

- The Subramanianator trolled V Hanumantha Rao (Indian National Congress) [even during his farewell speech](http://imgur.com/UK5eV4m). You gotta love that guy!

- VP Singh Badnore (BJP) [quoted John Keats’s “Ode to Melancholy”](http://imgur.com/uqxQoL8).



- Chairman Hamid Ansari (The Coolest Man Alive) [trolled](http://imgur.com/Pf9anKg) Tarun Vijay (BJP) by asking him to use his immense rhetorical skills and confine the speech to three minutes. Jaya Bachchan joined the trolling my asking members who speak too much to conclude their speech in two lines. #AnsariRocks 

- Tarun Vijay [roared back](http://imgur.com/4ibVzoL) with a *sher*. (#SelfThoo)

> “Let us do full enemy-enemy, but keep some space,

> If we ever become friends, we must not feel shame.”

- KC Tyagi (JDU) was in [full stand-up mode](http://imgur.com/mXJQv9Z). He started off by telling Ansari that he is going back to being a wild-child. “I will break Section 144 and do long duration discussions in Unparliamentary language,” he said. **“LOL,”** said everyone else.

I am stuck in a bad situation and I was hoping you could help me by guiding me on what to do or pointing to someone who could maybe guide me

**What I need help with** : Choosing a path to land a job as soon as possible

**What my problem is :** Was an entrepreneur for 3 years - I have only generalist skills, no employable skills. And I dont have money saved up. 

Some histroy -

I'm an Engineer with an MBA in Banking and Finance [Finished mba  2 years back from a top-12 college in India]. Right out of college I landed a job as a business analyst at a good IT firm [not Infosys/tcs etc] but I didn’t join that company and instead went into the family business.


Since  early 2014, I have been working for my 3 family businesses and done all sorts of general-ish stuff [One's a new school, another an industrial equipment manufacturing factory and the the third is a construction firm making residential apartments]


* in 2014, Worked towards planning, execution, purchase related stuff of construction of our school - involved dealing with suppliers, contractors etc


* In 2015, Worked in day to day planning, execution, management of our industrial manufacturing unit. Did lot of touring for this, to build better relationship with our clients and suppliers. I have experience of B2B marketing, building and maintaining client and supplier relationships etc]


* In 2016, in the construction firm, I oversaw and completed a small residential project and involved in a lot of aspects. Ive gone abroad in exhibitions and done B2C marketing, involved in sales and marketing department, designing/tweaking online ad campaigns, decision making for local sales channels like hoardings etc, supervision of day to day work on construction site etc. I believe I have a baisc working knowledge of the construction industry now.

However, now I am looking for a job since I haven’t earned anything in the past 3 years. **I cant take money from my family now due to a complicated situation. I am completely on my own** ,  There are no future earning prospects from the business for me, and my only way to survive is by taking up a job. Unfortunately, I don’t have any employable skills. I just don’t know what to do.


**I need a path to a job.** What is something I can do to land a job as quickly as possible. Can a person like me even get a job now ? I’m age 27 .


I was looking at 3 fields, but all involve a  lengthy studying time/skill acquisition time and less chance of getting a job – and time is something I don’t have : study finance to land a financial analyst job , study applied statistics to land a data analytics job – or somehow try to apply for business analyst job [by refreshing my domain knowledge from MBA]. I see a very very slim chance of me getting a job in these fields

Another thing I was thinking of was either take coaching for 10th standard Science/Maths or teach for MBA Entrance like CAT/GMAT etc. But how would I go about getting hired by a coaching center ?

Please help me.

tl;dr - help an unemployable, penniless ex-entrepreneur land a job.",6

###Headline Stories

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

Millions of frustrated math students in schools across India have complained a million times about how nobody is ever going to use pythagorean theorems in real life.

###Headline Stories
***

**Pandering To The Base**

Every politician does it. From the Donald in the US to Modi in India, it’s a political science lesson that crosses borders. As much as we parade the “developing-nation” tag around, India’s economy is still heavily dependant on agriculture as it employs almost two-thirds of the nation’s people. And these farmers also constitute Modi’s base and naturally, his government needs to pander to them before the forth-coming state elections. After a union budget that was largely seen as pro-farmer by earmarking almost $826 million (₹5,524 crore) for crop insurance plans, the government might play two more cards to appease the backbone of the economy. One, officials said last week that they are considering imposing a [penalty](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-crop-insurance-idUSL3N16U22P) on delaying of claim settlements for crop insurance. That’s when you buy insurance and if the rains don’t come in and your crops fail, you get paid a settlement. Two, the government is likely to extend the the current 25% wheat import tax which expires in March to continue [beyond](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-wheat-duty-idINKCN0WN1H7) March. The tax was imposed to shield domestic wheat farmers from cheap imports. Wasn’t exactly effective since wheat output in 2015 was down 10% from 2014, despite the tax.


**The Great Indian Addiction**

Indian people are addicted. It’s not a drug, gambling or internet addiction. It’s an addiction to gold. Gold imports make up a quarter of India’s trade deficit because we import almost 10 lakh kgs of gold annually. Billionaire Warren Buffett says about gold: “It doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you.”  Clearly, Indian people think that Buffett uncle doesn’t know anything about gold. Rehabilitating the Indian people from this addiction can be hard but the government is trying. Recently, it introduced a 1% excise duty on imported gold jewellry. How did that go down? Jewellers went on an indefinite strike which was called off last week after [assurances](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-strike-idINKCN0WM01T) that excise department officials won’t harass jewellers. The government also started a campaign to monetize the privately owned horde of Indian gold to cut down on imports. How has that worked out? The scheme only managed to attract 0.015% of the estimated horde of gold that is currently in family lockers and temple vaults. There was some golden news on that front last week as the iconic 200-year-old [Siddhivinayak](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-siddhihvinayak-temple-idINKCN0WK1ZF) temple in Mumbai announced its participation in the scheme.

**Because Karma Is A Bitch**

Petty sabotage and backstabbing isn’t just limited to undercover spies and Indian politics anymore. The corporates are adopting these strategies as well. Last week, Uber filed a lawsuit at the Delhi High Court against its biggest Indian competitor, Ola. The lawsuit accuses Ola of creating 90,000 fake Uber accounts and using them to book over 400,000 rides, only to be cancelled at the last [moment](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/23/11292310/uber-ola-lawsuit-india-fake-rides-lyft). Classic prank by Ola, right? Except Uber claims that Ola did this to disrupt its operations and frustrate its drivers. And Uber would know that because it has been accused of doing the exact same thing to its biggest US competitor, Lyft. Two years ago, Lyft accused Uber of booking and cancelling over 5,000 rides using fake accounts that were traced back to Uber employees. If true, Ola will only have taken a page from Uber’s own playbook. If you’re a betting person, be sure to put your money on Uber - that company’s got deep pockets and can drag this out as long as it takes. It recently declared $1 billion (₹6,688 crore) in annual profits from it’s [top 30](http://www.newsweek.com/uber-profits-elsewhere-support-sustainable-spending-china-ceo-440705) cities alone. To be fair, they also said they were sustaining huge losses in China where the company holds a 30% market share.

**Auto Engines Are The New Moon Landing**

69th Richest Indian on the famous Forbes Rich-list and the co-founder of Infosys, Nandan Nilekani is known for investing in startups that focus on big, transformative ideas. In his investment portfolio is Team Indus, a company that aims to land a rover on the moon and Systemantics, a company that focuses on robots. Last week, Nilekani made his [biggest](http://thetechportal.in/2016/03/24/sedemac-mechatronics-funding/) startup investment yet in a company called Sedemac Mechatronics. What’s bigger than futuristic robots and landing on the moon? Time travel, perhaps? No, apparently, it’s building small engines and powertrains for auto companies. Nilekani led the latest round of funding in Sedemac which summed up to a total of $7.5 million (₹50 crore). Sedemac counts the big boys of the auto industry like Tata Motors, Mahindra Group, Ashok Leyland as its clients and was started by an engineering professor at IIT-B with a couple of fellow IITians.

**The Chinese Dragon Wants In On India**

The “Big Three” of e-commerce in India - Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon - will soon become the “Big Four” with the entry of Alibaba, the chinese e-commerce giant in India. Officials from the company that is poised to [surpass](http://www.businessinsider.in/Alibaba-on-course-to-become-worlds-top-retailer/articleshow/51507633.cms) the world’s biggest retailer, Walmart and claim that tag for itself, said last week that Alibaba was looking to expand its presence in India. It is looking to directly enter the online retail segment later this year. Run by China’s richest person, Jack Ma, the company already owns 40% of Paytm and 4% of Snapdeal. Are Indian e-commerce companies coming together like brothers-in-arms to fight off competition from this foreign entity? Of course no. The Indians didn’t unite when the British literally invaded and aren’t going to do that now with the Chinese either. In fact, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal and his Snapdeal counterpart Kunal Bahl already found themselves in a war of words on [Twitter](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/flipkart-s-sachin-bansal-takes-jibe-at-alibaba-s-india-entry-116032600040_1.html) over Alibaba’s planned expansion in India. Alibaba, which still conjures images of forty thieves in one’s imagination, may tie up with the [Tatas](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-21/news/71705366_1_digital-india-alibaba-group-chairman-cyrus-mistry) to launch its online retail business as a joint-venture. This is because FDI regulations still don’t allow foreign companies to sell directly to Indian consumers, which is what Alibaba wants to do. Amazon, the US ambassador to the industry, merely connects buyers and sellers and doesn’t sell itself.

**Oli Gets Oil**

Nepal’s Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli recently took a trip up north to Beijing and stumbled his way into signing an agreement with China for the supply of petroleum products to [Nepal](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-nepal-idUSKCN0WP1WV). The country, which serves as a strategic buffer between India and China, adopted its first post-monarchy constitution last year. But protesters opposing the new constitution blocked trucks carrying fuel and essential goods coming from India. This five-month long “unofficial blockade” of Nepal had disastrous consequences for the Nepalese economy due to its overwhelming dependence on India. The distraught country says it now wants to import 33% of Nepal’s fuel from China in the future. Basically, after being deeply hurt by what the Indians did, Nepal is now looking for some quick rebound action from the Chinese. Indian officials, however, are far from alarmed that Nepal is trying to move away from the Indian sphere of influence. Why? Because there is this big huge chunk of rock called the Himalayas between Nepal and China.

Move over, Dhoni, India’s test cricket Captain, Virat Kohli is the new darling of advertisers. After signing multi-crore endorsement deals with over 13 brands such as Adidas, Pepsi, Vicks, Boost, Colgate and many more, he’s now the newest member of the [100 crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/advertising/virat-kohli-joins-rs-100-crore-club-endorses-13-brands/articleshow/51520846.cms) club.

Chinese state-run media criticized PM Narendra Modi last week saying that his economic reforms have made “[little progress](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/neighbours/230316/narendra-modi-s-economic-reforms-made-little-progress-chinese-paper.html)”. The criticism was in response to fears that India is emerging as the world’s new economic engine. This can only mean one thing. China is anti-national and should go to Pakistan.

**Apple’s New China Is India**

When Steve Jobs, ex-hippie and the founder of Apple, visited India in the 1970s, he wore a lungi and [roamed](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/what-steve-jobs-did-in-india-35-years-ago-225246) barefoot. Until, of course, the Indian national disease of diarrhea cut his trip short and sent him back to the US. Fortunately for all of us, when Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple, visited India last week his attire did not include a lungi and he probably drank bottled water, as is tradition for all foreign tourists in India. In between wild Bollywood parties at SRK’s house and IPL matches in Kanpur, Tim [announced](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-tim-cook-samples-bollywood-cricket-in-bid-to-woo-india-1463822223) a startup accelerator in Bengaluru and the opening of two new offices including one in Hyderabad. It wasn’t all play and no work - Tim met with businessmen like the CEOs of ICICI Bank, Vodafone India, TCS and heads of state like Prime Minister Modi, the Telangana CM and many more. But why India and why now? After reporting the first quarterly decline in sales that was largely caused due to slowing growth in China, Apple is now searching for something other than China to fuel growth for the coming decade. And Apple’s next China might just be India. Tim termed his visit to India as ‘fantastic’ but then again, he also ran into Alia Bhatt. So it’s entirely possible that his statements were laced with sarcasm.  

**The One With Trump, Brexit and India**

Britain, the former colonial master of India and more countries than you can even name, is going through an independence movement of its own. Currently, the country is a part of the European Union, a political and economic union of 28 countries in Europe. In a public vote to be held on June 23rd, Britishers will decide if the nation will stay in the European Union or get out of the European Union. All of that may be Britain’s headache but a new report out of SBI [suggests](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-brexit-can-open-up-opportunities-for-india-sbi-research-report-2212552) that even though a Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) could be terrible for Europe, it could turn out to be hugely beneficial for India since Indian companies will no longer need to follow complex trade agreements while dealing with Britain. Likewise, a former US Diplomat says a Trump presidency in the US, while [terrible](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/if-donald-trump-becomes-us-president-india-may-gain-at-chinas-expense-heres-why/articleshow/52380459.cms) for China and Pakistan (...not to mention Mexico) might actually turn out to be great for India as ~~Donald Trump~~ Dear Leader’s foreign policies are likely to shift the balance of power in Asia in favour of India. The word to describe what you’re feeling right now is schadenfreude - taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Trust me, *I know words. I have the best [words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T-Eo0j092Q)*

**The Banking Bloodbath**

With the whole bad loans crisis being shoved in everyone’s faces, it’s no surprise that banks are feeling the heat. Saddled with a ton of losses caused by increasing net non-performing assets (the fancy term for bad loans), conditions are becoming dire. A host of smaller banks reported earnings last week and it’s not good. If you have a phobia of falling bank profits, turn away now and seek professional help because it’s about to get gruesome. Alright, [here](http://www.livemint.com/Money/1MpJ5uNbQXhacOWKTo3PWJ/PSU-banks-shares-fall-after-weak-earnings.html) we go: Dena Bank reported a loss of ₹326 crore, Allahabad Bank reported a loss of ₹581 crore, Central Bank of India reported a loss of ₹898 crore, UCO Bank reported a loss of ₹1,715 crore and Syndicate Bank [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/syndicate-bank-q4-loss-at-rs-2158cr-provisions-jump-3-fold_6677621.html) a loss of ₹2,158 crore. Going for the silver medal is Bank of Baroda with a loss of ₹3,230 crore, the second highest loss in the history of Indian banking. And now, for the gold medal, the worst loss in the history of Indian banking ever was reported at a record-breaking ₹5,367 crore by *drumroll* Punjab National Bank. It feels good to have found the rock-bottom at last. At least now, there is nowhere to go but up. That’s what investors in bank stocks are saying to themselves so they can sleep well at night. Let’s hope for their sake that we don’t find a new bottom in the next quarter.

**|| || || > | | | | | |**

So you might’ve heard: The banking industry is in a bit of a tight spot. There haven’t been any bankruptcies (phew) yet. But there’s blood on the streets. And the only way to patch the wound is to stick together in times of trouble. State Bank of India, one of the largest banks in India, [proposed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-bank-of-india-says-no-talks-on-merging-with-any-other-lenders-1408323) a plan to stick together and merge with its 5 associate banks: State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore plus the newly created Bharatiya Mahila Bank. If merged, the combined bank will become a banking behemoth with 50 crore customers. And behemoths don’t bleed easy. Taking cue, the government is also urging UCO Bank, Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank (all of whom have reported losses) to find themselves a relatively well off bank and merge their losses away. Playing the merger game is tricky business. You don’t want your merger to be like Romeo and Juliet. Sure, they made history but they both died in the end. You want your merger to be like Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. One that can live happily ever after.

* Chalk this one up to the Romeo and Juliet category of mergers - the Chairman and Managing Director of Air India, Mr. Lohani has [blamed](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/air-india-merger-led-to-a-mess-ashwani-lohani/article8621785.ece) the distraught airline’s debt and losses on the 2011 merger of Air India and Indian Airlines. Mr. Lohani, who took over the basket case of an airliner just last year, seems to have lost all hope as he stated that Air India has a bureaucracy bigger than even the Indian Railways, the mother-load of all bureaucracies.

* After the rise of Flipkart and the likes, everyone and their mother is getting in on the ecommerce game. The Tatas are now [launching](https://inc42.com/flash-feed/tata-group-enter-ecommerce-space-launch-cliq/) CliQ, an online retailer selling apparel, electronics, footwear and more from over 80 brands. This comes right after Arvind Ltd. (the Indian partner of brands like Arrow, Lee, Wrangler etc.) launched its ecommerce play, NNNow.com (I didn’t have a seizure, that’s the actual name). This also comes months after the Reliance Group launched ajio.com and the Aditya Birla Group launched abof.com.

* Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka is making some serious coin - Sikka, who has boosted all the numbers that matter since taking over in 2014, will be [paid](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/vishal-sikka-kicks-in-big-salary-spikes-at-infosys/articleshow/52287712.cms) ₹74 crore including stock options this year, which works out to 116 times the median salary of Infosys employees. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, however has in the past suggested that the highest salary paid in a company shouldn’t be more than 25 times the lowest salary paid in the company.

* Vijay Mallya, who has indirectly paid the salaries of thousands of journalists around the world along with Donald Trump, is scared. He’s scared that Indians will come after him with pitchforks if he ever returns from the UK. Accordingly, Mallya [says](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/vijay-mallya-fugitive-businessman-consider-india-return-if-safety-freedom-assured-1560279) he’ll only return if his safety and freedom is assured. GOI’s formal request to the British government to extradite Mallya was declined. More problems to boot: A ₹2.4 crore dividend payable to Mallya from United Breweries was withheld.

They say there’s no use digging up old corpses. And declassifying old government records can sometimes certainly feel like digging up old corpses. Well, this time the government might have found a zombie. After releasing old records relating to the Azad Hind Bank, founded by Subhash Chandra Bose, many borrowers have [approached](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-16/news/73126343_1_currency-notes-bank-notes-legal-tender) the finance ministry asking the government to recognize the currency issued by the Azad Hind Bank in 1944 as legal tender, so they can use it to repay existing loans. In a country of more than a billion people, there’s potential for more than a billion bizarre stories. And this is just one. 

$1 billion is the number of the week for Apple. $1 billion is the amount that Warren Buffett, the billionaire that has traditionally and even proudly shunned technology, has [invested](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21699139-meaning-two-odd-and-connected-investments-1-billion-stakes-menu) in Apple shares over the last quarter. $1 billion is also the amount that Apple invested in Didi, not the Bengali politician, but Uber’s competitor in China. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s girlfriend, reportedly owns shares of Apple, which makes her an investor in Didi. That’s got to make for some very awkward pillow talk.

**A Government of India Original**

The stage has been set - on one side, we have the world renowned economist, Raghuram Rajan and on the other side, we have the new MP on the block, Subramanian Swamy. It’s a battle of wits. It’s a battle of politics. But to find out if Rajan gets a second term at the RBI, or if Swamy successfully sends Rajan back to the US - watch out for season 2, coming this August. Apparently, the government is going to keep everyone [waiting](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-govt-to-take-call-on-raghuram-rajan-s-rbi-term-extension-in-august-2215544) till the 11th hour and only decide if Rajan gets a second term at the RBI in August, a month before his current term expires. Just when you thought you were getting into the show, they drop a huge cliffhanger and make you wait for the next season. Don’t you hate it when that happens? We already have the protagonist and the antagonist for this plot - might as well add in some supporting characters: Uday Kotak - promoter of the Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Adi Godrej - head of the Godrej group have endorsed Rajan for a second term. Even a poll of top CEOs from corporate India found overwhelming support for Rajan. So everyone wants a second term for Rajan. But that’s the thing with season premiers - they tend to take very unexpected plot twists.


**Another Round of Startup ~~Funding~~ Troubles**

Zimply, PepperTap, Stayzilla, TinyOwl, Swiggy… these words don’t sound like words at all. And until a few years ago, they were just a bunch of typos. But today, they are all venture-funded startups that recruit from some of the best talent pools in the country, the IIMs. Or at least they used to, until the startup boom turned into a balloon that’s constantly trying to run away from thorns. In the recent round of troubles, officials in charge of placements at IIMs are annoyed with startups deferring joining dates and marking down pay packages. To take the classic example of what happened with Flipkart, the company told all new recruits from IIM-A to sit back and relax for now and join the company in December instead of joining next month. And in exchange for the lost pay which can often run into several lakhs, Flipkart will bump up the signing bonus by a sweet ₹1.5 lakh. Now, the authorities at IIM-A are not happy with [these](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/iim-ahmedabad-asks-flipkart-to-address-placement-issue-2819413/) shenanigans at all, since a lot of students have loans they need to pay back. And have warned startups that there could be consequences. Moreover, what if the students take up writing in their free time till December? India cannot afford another Chetan Bhagat right now.

**A Change of Plans**

Last August, the RBI gave approvals to 11 companies to set up payments banks. The 11 companies are some of the who’s who of the business world - Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla, Vodafone, Airtel, IDFC Bank, Tech Mahindra and many more. And then there was also the Indian Department of Posts. But what in god’s name is a payments bank, I hear you ask. A payments bank is just a normal bank, except it can’t give out loans. And before you ask the next most obvious question, they make money from fees and commissions. But increasingly, the process of chasing after the RBI to obtain these approvals is starting to resemble dogs chasing after cars. They wouldn’t know what to do if they ever caught one. Now, three entities that received approvals including IDFC Bank and Tech Mahindra are [dropping](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/tech-mahindra-drops-out-of-payments-bank-race-841548) plans to ever start a payments bank. The primary reason given for the change of plans is that competing with 11 other deep pocketed companies will result into wafer-thin profits which doesn’t make business sense. In short, simple capitalism at work. After all, chasing after things we don’t have, only to realize that we don’t want it when we do get our hands on it - is a timeless classic that is rooted deep inside all of us.

**Pakistan Is Listing Everything**

In 2013, Pakistan, our dear neighbour to the west, was about to Greece the place up by defaulting on its loans. You didn’t hear much about this because the IMF swooped in and saved the day by bailing Pakistan out to the tune of $6.7 billion. But IMF money rarely comes with no strings attached. As part of the bailout, Pakistan was required to privatize the economy by listing many of its state-owned companies on the stock exchange. Last week, the country [announced](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/world-news/pakistan-to-start-soft-marketing-state-airline-sale-in-june/263644/) that it is looking for investors as it plans to do exactly that and list over 68 companies including the Pakistan International Airlines, a bunch of steel mills and utility companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which by the way is also being listed. So if you know a friend who’s got a few million lying around - hit them up, Pakistan’s looking for investors. Or we could make a kickstarter campaign. I can kick in 50 bucks. Either way, this is definitely not Pakistan’s week. Historically, India didn’t have access to Central Asia and Afghanistan since Pakistan blocked all the land routes. But with a newly [signed](http://qz.com/690217/india-just-played-a-masterstroke-in-iran-to-reinforce-its-regional-soft-power-status-in-asia/) contract with Iran, India can potentially bypass Pakistan and trade with Afghanistan and Central Asia through a sea route to Iran and a rail link from there on.

* If you’ve been reading this series regularly, you’ve likely realized two things by now - One, there is still faith for humanity and two, there is none for the banks. Canara Bank [reported](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/wWFiLKBr59fsto0fcqlbpO/Canara-Bank-posts-Rs-3905-crore-loss-in-Q4.html) a loss of ₹3,905 crore for January-March quarter. When the davids fall like dominos, the goliaths have to be limping, at the very least. The State Bank of India, the largest bank in the country, [limped](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sbi-q4-fy-201516-results/article8654996.ece) along with a 66% fall in net profit to ₹1,263 crore. But the bad news at SBI wasn’t as bad as everyone expected, and so shares of SBI are up 17% despite a fall in profits. Yeah. That happens. Welcome to Dalal Street.

* For years now, kulcha warriors across the nation have been screaming that all things western are literally cancer. Well, they might not be entirely wrong. After demolishing Nestle by finding lead in Maggi, the powers that be have wished the end of Domino’s Pizza, McDonald’s and Subway as well. A study by the Center for Science and Environment [found](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/india-domino-s-mcdonald-s-operators-hurt-by-bread-cancer-report) that the bread used by these companies includes a cancer-causing substance. Shares of Jubilant Foodworks (Indian partner of Domino’s) and Westlife Development (franchisee of McDonald’s) were down on the news.

* As a net importer of oil, India has raked in millions as oil prices nosedived from a high of $100 to a low of $30. But every coin has two sides - and sadly, this isn’t that double-headed coin Jai used in Sholay. In real life, the good comes with the bad. Some 7 million Indians work abroad in the oil-rich Gulf countries that have fallen on bad times, and more and more are being forced to come home. Remittances from Indians working abroad [slumped](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-remittances-idINKCN0YG2OE) 27% to $48 billion - lowest since the 2008 crisis.

* The markets have a reputation for being sensitive. They tend to react even if Raghuram Rajan so much as sneezes. So events like the US Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate hike, or Britain’s referendum to leave the European Union, or China’s worsening economy are all but guaranteed to sway the markets one way or another. But forget all of that. After a 2-year drought, we have a monsoon on our doorsteps that has been forecast as above average - and experts [say](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/forget-fed-brace-up-for-monsoon-bonanza-on-d-street-el-nino-is-gone/articleshow/52430422.cms), this is the event that will define the economy over the next few months.

**2020: Double the Coal, Double the Asthma**

Tesla Motors of the United States just launched the Model 3 electric car that can run entirely on solar power, reducing any climate effects since it doesn’t need gasoline. Piyush Goyal of the Indian Power and Coal Ministry, on the other hand, just assured everyone that India will indeed [double] (http://profit.ndtv.com/news/commodities/article-india-to-rely-on-state-miners-to-meet-coal-target-piyush-goyal-1291421) its coal production by 2020, increasing every imaginable climate effect. So the government wants to increase coal production to 1.5 billion tonnes by 2020. State-owned Coal India ([COALINDIA](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ACOALINDIA&ei=vtABV7DnAtbajAGNr57QBQ)), India’s largest coal mining company, is already on track to increase its own production to 1 billion tonnes by 2020. The private sector was expected to pick up the tab for the remaining half a billion tonnes. But since the private sector companies are strapped for cash and can’t increase coal production to meet the target, the coal minister is pushing for other state-owned companies like NTPC ([NTPC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ANTPC&ei=XtEBV7n2CoSA2AaLz7vwCA)), National Aluminium Co ([NATIONALUM](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ANATIONALUM&ei=ndEBV6GTBISe2AbWvIy4AQ)) to step up their coal production so the government can meet that target. “Renewables? Climate change? Pollution? Asthma? What do those words even mean?” - Piyush Goyal (paraphrased).

([ITC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AITC&ei=rNEBV-GJHMP02AbI5KiABQ)) through the Tobacco Institute of India have shut down all cigarette manufacturing facilities since [April 1st](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-itc-not-ready-to-print-bigger-health-warnings-on-cigarette-packs-factories-to-remain-shut-2197282). The stated reason for this is because of the ‘ambiguity’ over the size of pictorial health warnings on cigarette packages. Every cigarette packet is mandated by law to have horrible pictures of Satan’s lungs over them to discourage smoking. While a parliamentary committee had recommended the size of those pictures to be 50% of the packaging, the health ministry had ordered for the figure to be 85%. Not knowing which figure to follow, the cigarette manufacturers have decided to just shut down all operations and take daily losses of ₹350 crore. The theory behind the size of the pictures being - larger the picture, lesser the smoking. If you listen hard, you can almost hear the patron saint of anti-smoking ads, Mukesh turning in his grave thinking of what would’ve been if only the 85% sized pictures had come in his lifetime.

**Buybacks and Dividends to the Rescue!**

The Indian football team can’t set goals to win the FIFA World Cup 2018, unfortunately that’s just not realistic. And one of the basic rules of setting goals is that they should be realistically achievable. But somebody in the government never got that memo. After five consecutive years of failing to achieve targets of money raised through disinvestment, the government still set an all-time record [high](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/PAYP49n1pV885tWIPO7d3J/Disinvestment-scorecard-Govt-a-to-miss-target-16th-tim.html) target for this year. So it shouldn’t exactly be a surprise when it misses targets this year as well, which will be the 16th time in 25 years now. But unrealistic targets also lead to desperate actions to fulfill those targets. In this case, the government is looking at buybacks and special [dividends](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Govt-banks-on-unlisted-PSUs-to-mop-up-Rs-5k-cr-this-week/articleshow/51577307.cms) from unlisted state-owned companies like Hindustan Aeronautics and others. The extra cash in those companies will now be used to buy shares back from the government and declare special dividends amounting to almost ₹5,000 crore to help the government meet targets this year. Who wants to bet we’ll still miss targets this year and set an even higher target for next year?

**BJP’s Beef Ban Backfires**

(pause for reader to appreciate that alliteration) As a part of the BJP’s beef ban that was introduced in BJP-ruled states last year, it is prohibited to sell your cattle for slaughter. For people living in cities drinking Starbucks coffee, that’s hardly a problem since they don’t really own a lot of cattle. But for farmers living in villages drinking unfiltered water, that’s a huge [problem](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-beef-idINKCN0WU1UQ). If the rains don’t show up for a particular year, the crops fail and the farmer sells his cattle to feed his family. And when the rains do show up the next year, the crops blossom and the farmer buys the cattle back. But the beef ban just threw a wrench in this cycle by making it harder for people to sell their cows. Cattle prices have fallen across the country, by almost 40 to 60 percent in one district of Maharashtra and India’s meat exports have dropped 13%. This comes at a time when the government is trying very hard to appease farmers in a bid to win state elections later this year.

**For Sale: Tata Steel UK, Condition: Slightly Used**

On second thoughts, slightly used might not be the correct way of describing Tata Steel’s UK business. ‘Abused by the Chinese’ might be more accurate. Tata Steel ([TATASTEEL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATATASTEEL&ei=3NEBV-H3IceJ2AbIrarYCw)) entered the UK Steel market by acquiring Corus, a company that was three times bigger than itself for $8.1 billion (₹53,654 crore) in 2007. Fast forward to two months ago, it declared a [loss](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/tata-steel-reports-third-quarter-loss-chinese-imports) of £68 million (₹641 crore) after suffering from cheap Chinese imports, high energy costs and weak demand. Last week, Tata Steel announced that it was putting up its entire UK business on the [auction](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot) block. The problem is: no one’s bidding. The UK government is even debating on just nationalizing the whole business to prevent mass layoffs and to protect what is an important part of the British economy. Of course, that’ll only be temporary nationalization until suitable buyers from the private sector can be found. Otherwise, it’ll be socialism (gasp).

**100% FDI in E-commerce *T&C Apply**

Millions of family-owned corner stores across India have moaned and complained since forever against e-commerce companies taking their customers away. And with Amazon gaining a foothold and Alibaba planning an Indian expansion, the e-commerce field in India is increasingly being dominated by foreign companies. The corner store guys were having none of this and filed a lawsuit saying this was illegal since foreign companies aren’t exactly allowed to set up retail operations in India. After years of uncertainty, we finally have a ruling on this - foreign companies are now legally allowed to set up e-commerce operations in India, but terms and conditions [apply](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec51a45e-f5be-11e5-9afe-dd2472ea263d.html#axzz44oZbeUBy) (don’t they always?). These companies can’t sell directly to customers, but can only connect buyers and sellers. No single seller can account for more than 25% of sales. And these companies can not set prices themselves to offer discounts, as many do now to attract customers. Buy that smartphone for cheap while you can, the days of deep discounts may end before you know it.

Its been 60 days. Why can't she just get over it?,153,33uoij,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/33uoij/its_been_60_days_why_cant_she_just_get_over_it/,119,1430021832.0,"There is this girl I know. I initially befriended her, then did some business with her, and eventually convinced her into agreeing to live with me.

Then for 200 days, I raped her. I brainwashed her, I taught her what to think, and I raped her some more.

But I also fed her, took care of her medical expenses, and introduced her to Netflix - something she'd have never experienced the joy of if she wasn't my captive. 

After about 200 days, it was becoming difficult for me to keep hold of her. My finances were in ruin due to other issues so I decided to free her. I gave her the freedom to leave and patted myself on the back for freeing her.

Meanwhile, during her time as my sex-slave, she developed a Stockholm syndrome - a part of her had fallen in love with me and started to look up to me, glorify me, and imitate me.  

However, since I set her free, she hasn't been able to do well. She's not been able to find a job, not been able to create any savings, has a dysfunctional thought process, cannot execute things properly. 

But  it has been 60 days since I set her free. If she can't get her things in order in such a long time, how can anyone blame my 200 days of rape for it? 

I mean if she can't get her house in order even after 60 days, its completely her fault. A large part of her even agrees with me on this.

However, there is this small part of her brain that keeps talking about how she has PTSD from my rape. I keep telling her that this is a deluded fascist part of her brain that is making up fiction about how it could have been if I had not raped her. I mean duh, she'd have never heard of Netflix. Besides, everyone else was raping too so its not really my fault.

In any case, this fascist part of her brain talks about justice and vengeance against me for my rape. But I prefer to ignore and not talk about those old days. Sometimes I even tell her that the rape was good for her. I suggest that its best we ignore the past and build on our special relationship and continue to work together for a better future for the both of us. She agrees with me for the most part except when her fascist mindset kicks in.

**Killing Tax Havens - One Treaty At A Time**

Question - What country ranks second in the share of foreign portfolio investments made in the Indian stock market? Answer - First of all, that is a very specific question to ask. And second of all, if you [answered](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-12/news/73039798_1_tax-treaty-capital-gains-tax-mauritius) Mauritius, give yourself a pat on the back. It’s not that ~~Martian~~ Mauritian citizens are crazy about Indian stocks, Mauritius is just an island that is even smaller than Mumbai and Delhi put together. It’s that investments made through Mauritius were exempt from Indian capital gains taxes - which essentially transformed Mauritius into a tax haven. It was all legal under a 30-year old treaty between the two countries that was signed in 1983. Ahh, the 1980s - when the Panama Papers wasn’t a thing, the accountants didn’t have to worry about ethics, and writing physical letters was actually cool and not just hipster cool. But all that and more is changing. Under an amendment to the treaty that was [agreed](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/u4AzTTKA5vCRJBWhANkuZN/Some-FAQs-on-the-Mauritius-tax-treaty.html) upon last week, India will begin imposing a capital gains tax on all future investments made through the country. This gives existing investors some wiggle room, and doesn’t trigger a crash in case existing investors decide to pull out.


**Raghu’s Second Term**

Time flies when you’re having fun, and it’s already time for another governor at the RBI. Current governor Raghuram Rajan’s term is about to end in September and there’s some awkward tension in the air about his reappointment since Rajan’s crusade against bad loans is expected to be done by March 2017, a full 6 months after his term expires. Chosen under former PM Manmohan Singh’s administration, Rajan [says](http://www.businessinsider.in/RBIs-Raghuram-Rajan-keeps-mum-about-second-term-but-reveals-his-backup-plan/articleshow/52185985.cms) he hasn’t been asked if he wants to continue as governor and intends to go back to teaching when he’s done. He can act as coy as he wants, but everyone knows that he wants to continue as governor. Who wouldn’t? It’s like asking an olympic gold winner if he’d like to continue winning the gold. However, the newest member of the Rajya Sabha, Subramanian Swamy, has [stated](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/send-raghuram-rajan-back-to-chicago-subramanian-swamys-new-attack-1405498) that Rajan is unsuitable to run the RBI and shouldn’t be reappointed. Swamy says that Rajan should instead pack up his bags and go to the US, where he is a professor at the University of Chicago. ‘Go back to (insert country here)’ seems to be a recurring theme lately.

**EPF Changes: Strike Three?**

At first they tried to tax your EPF withdrawals. But that didn’t work out. Then, they tried to restrict EPF withdrawals until you’re 58. But that didn’t work out either. Now, they are back. And this time, they want to help you buy a house. A new scheme currently under discussion would [allow](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/epfo-members-to-benefit-as-govt-plans-low-cost-housing-scheme-for-over-5-cr-subscribers/251510/) you to pledge future EPF contributions as installments towards buying a house. Here’s how it would work: You go out and try to find your ultimate dream house. You give up and settle on one that your wife likes, because you just want to get this over with. Then you find a bank that doesn’t think you’re Mallya 2.0 and gives you a home loan. And now, your future EPF contributions can count as installments on the home loan. But you also have to be a low-income first-time home buyer to qualify. The last two times any modifications to the EPF system have been proposed, they have backfired. If this were baseball, the batter is already two strikes down and might end up with a strikeout, if this backfires as well.

**Numbers You Don’t Want To Hear**

The kryptonite of any agrarian economy is a prolonged drought. Like the one we’ve been having in over 10 states for the past two years now. A recent study [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/rs-650000-crore-thats-the-impact-the-drought-will-have-on-the-indian-economy-says-assocham/) the total impact of that drought on the national economy at ₹6,50,000 crore. That number is so huge, your brain is incapable of processing it. That’s because a loss of ₹100 is a tragedy, a loss of ₹100 crore is a statistic. Moving on to some much lighter news - the Indian banking [system](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/its-that-bad-if-you-pay-rs-150-for-a-bank-stock-rs-50-is-going-as-bad-loan/articleshow/52291846.cms) is on fire. If you spend ₹150 on buying stock in the average Indian bank right now - you’d be spending ₹50 just to purchase the bad loans that come with the bank. The skeletons could’ve stopped tumbling out at any point - but what’s the fun in that? New estimates show that the amount of bad loans in the Indian banking system might be greater than the entire economy of New Zealand. Little reminder - In statistics, you can either pick the data and write the story it supports, or you can pick the story and write the data that supports it.

*“There is a probability that people may not spend the money and save it thereby not contributing to growth""* - Raghuram Rajan [criticizing](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/economy/article-raghuram-rajan-questions-helicopter-money-says-people-may-not-spend-1404047) ‘helicopter money’. Yes, everyone wishes that term meant money literally being dropped from helicopters. Or helicopter origami made out of currency notes. But it just means central banks printing money and giving it directly to the people by investing in public projects to spur growth and spending.
***
###Headline Stories
***

**No Money? No Problem**

No Problem for the banks that loaned you the money - big problems for you. The Lok Sabha just [passed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-bankruptcy-idUSKCN0XS1NW) the landmark Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Currently, we use a patchwork of laws that govern bankruptcies in India. That patchwork has resulted in 70,000 pending cases of bankruptcies. But the new bill sets a deadline of 180 days after the business defaults on loans during which the business owners and the lenders have to reach a resolution. Failing a resolution, the lenders can then sell the business to recover dues. This country is slowing moving to a market-based economy ever since the fall of the Soviet Union. And capitalism without bankruptcy is like christianity without hell. An interesting recommendation that could end up in the law seeks to ban bankrupt people from contesting in elections. Wonder if there was any specific person that inspired this recommendation. You know, a specific person who was a businessman and a politician but also went bankrupt while receiving excessive media coverage coinciding with a time when a lot of the banks are dealing with bad loans? (*cough cough* Vijay Mallya).

**A Democratic RBI**

Currently, the RBI functions like a dictatorship with the governor being the supreme leader. Basically, while sitting in his pajamas, Raghuram Rajan can make major changes that could either launch the economy into the future or turn the economy upside down. And nobody can do anything about it. But now the Finance Bill which just [passed](http://qz.com/676943/indias-bullet-proof-central-bank-is-about-to-get-another-layer-of-armour/) the Lok Sabha and is expected to pass the Rajya Sabha as well will turn the RBI into a quasi-democracy. The bill seeks to replace the current system with a six-member panel with three representatives from the government and three from the RBI. The panel will vote on the changes to be made and Rajan will be given the tie-breaker vote. No wonder Rajan is all for the new system because one, most major central banks do it this way, two, centralized power just hasn’t work out well historically and three, in case of terrible outcomes - just point to the panel for all the blame and in case of great outcomes - bask in the glory of all the history books and mainstream media credit as the governor of the RBI.

**Flopkart**

(That title was so obvious, it had to be used.) What’s the most important law of nature? No, it’s not ‘people who wear crocs don’t get laid’. It’s the law of gravity. What goes up must come down. Just a few years ago, Flipkart was the hot new thing on the startup scene. But now competition in the space is heating up. Starting just a few months ago, minority investors in Flipkart have begun to [slash](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/more-investors-mark-down-flipkart-valuation-116050400523_1.html) the value of their shares in Flipkart. In February, Morgan Stanley marked its investments in Flipkart down by 27%. Last month, T-Rowe Price marked its investments down by 15%. And now, Fidelity and Valic slashed the value of their investments by more than 20%. It’s not just Flipkart. HSBC [published](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/zomato-demicorn/) a report that basically says Zomato is worth only half of what people say it’s worth. Is this what it felt like in 2000 just before the startup bubble popped? Zomato, which is thought to be a unicorn (a startup worth a billion dollars) might just be a demicorn (a startup worth half a billion - trademark pending). 

**The Singh Bros of Ranbaxy**

They say you should never hide information from your doctors and lawyers. Add one more to that list - a Japanese corporation that’s buying a majority stake in your business. The Singh brothers, ex-promoters of pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy Laboratories, are finding out just what happens when you cross that line. In 2008, the Singh bros sold a majority stake in Ranbaxy to the Japanese corporation, Daiichi-Sankyo (with an appropriately Japanese name too). But they allegedly, hid information from Daiichi that Ranbaxy was adulterating drugs that were made in India and sold in the US. They were caught in 2013, and Daiichi-owned Ranbaxy had to pay $500 million in damages. Since Daiichi had no idea that Ranbaxy was involved in these shady dealings when it bought a majority stake in 2008, it sued the Singh brothers for hiding that information. An arbitration panel last week found the Singh brothers guilty and [asked](http://www.wsj.com/articles/former-ranbaxy-owners-ordered-to-pay-385-million-to-daiichi-sankyo-1462473046) them to pay $385 million to Daiichi as damages. That’s got to be a bitter pill to swallow.

* Thank god for politicians. Savour the joy of reading those words in one sentence because it’s probably not happening again. But whenever there are elections and politicians hit the road to campaign for votes, they seem to kickstart the country’s industrial sector. The core sector output which is an Index of 8 Core Industries [went](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/core-sector-output-rises-6-4-in-march-thanks-to-politicians/articleshow/52158936.cms) up by 6.4% in March, just before states begin voting in April.

* What comes to your mind when you picture the typical Indian farmer? A skinny, frail and rural fellow struggling to make ends meet? Perhaps, the male version of that old woman in Swades standing behind a lightbulb that goes “Bijli”? Well, you’d be right most of the time but not all. Some farmers actually do pretty well for themselves. Data from the agricultural census [says](http://scroll.in/article/807603/failure-of-reforms-5-of-indias-farmers-own-a-third-of-the-land) just 5% of the farmers own over 30% of India’s farmland.

* India’s leading tobacco company, ITC cannot make up its mind. Due to a new rule requiring cigarette manufacturers to cover 85% of the packaging in pictorial warnings, ITC had previously shut down factories in protest. And later resumed production. Last week, ITC demonstrated that they learned nothing from this incident as they [shut](http://www.livemint.com/Home-Page/ehyLC5mIksCHHNhEFTA2HO/ITC-factories-to-reopen-agrees-printing-bigger-pictorial-wa.html) down factories once again. And then, of course, resumed production within 48 hours. Frankly, people are going to be disappointed if they don’t do the same thing next week.

* Tata Steel’s UK business has been underwater for a long time now. And the lungs are about to give up and flood water. Unless someone throws in a lifebuoy. And that someone might be Sanjeev Gupta, an Indian-origin businessman, who is [bidding](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/00a3b3c6-0fae-11e6-839f-2922947098f0.html#axzz48DXOYxhZ) to acquire Tata Steel UK. The second best contender is a buyout from Tata UK’s own management team, but it seems like the captain might not have to go down with the ship after all.

Quick question - What do floor cleaner, tooth powder, balm and face pack all have in common? Answer - They all have cow urine in them.

BigBasket, the online grocery store, just [started](http://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/business-of-brands/six-things-to-watch-out-for-in-hindustan-unilevers-q4-results/52141369) carrying their cow-urine based products as well.

India’s GDP Growth is [expected](http://www.hindustantimes.com/business/india-s-gdp-to-grow-7-4-this-fiscal-stanchart/story-lmZkvhedJYnBynZlhg0r3I.html) to remain stable and unchanged at 7.4% this year despite good monsoon and increased consumer spending. Just for some trivia, and this is an apples to oranges comparison, so don’t even try to make one, but the last time US GDP growth was at 7.4%, the year was 1988, the Soviet Union was very much a thing and Salman Khan had just debuted in his first movie ever.

I could not focus properly and I honestly don't have interest in finance field(first two levels of CA were easy for me and this final is like torture to me). I completed IGNOU BCOM(As regular BCOM is not allowed while pursuing CA). I will complete CMA(course like CA but relatively easy) this February. I am interested in technology. I self-learned various things like web development and IOT stuff. I would not get bored doing or experimenting these stuff. 

Are there any good short term courses either related to this stream like CISA (which includes IT+ Audit) or any other different stream altogether. how is business analytics course by [IIDT](http://www.iidt.edu.in/courses.php). I am depressed right now. 

I am worried about switching streams. Here in India people mostly give jobs based on your degree (at least eligibility is considered based on having certain degrees).

However, slowly but steadily, Indian investments are trickling into the Canadian economy. Economic stability has become key to Canada's success and is decisive in attracting investors from all over the world to its shores. Investment in Canada is considered a safe haven for investors' hard-earned money and continues to represent a solid foundation for future growth and prosperity. 

Canada is the No. 1 investment destination in the G7 and was ranked 4th in the world as the best country to conduct business over the period 2010-14, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Business Environment Ranking August 2010 report. 

Indian investors have still been shy about investing in Canada. Most investors from India prefer the UK and Europe as well as the countries of the Middle East, historically. Outside this region, Indian investments are scattered and limited. Canada is a stable, secure nation, and endowed with abundant natural resources. Its currency has always been very stable and its safest borders are with the largest economy of the world. Canada/US relations can be described as the best that any two nations can have. 

Canada ranks 27th in terms of FDI investment in India and its investments are mostly in the development sector. Whereas Indian FDI approved until 2009 in Canada is restricted to $570 million and ranks as the 20th destination of Indian investments. 

Recently, in Windsor, I saw a big hoarding on the road showing the name ""Aditya Birla"" on it. I stopped and looked at it with admiration, thinking, at last, Indian investors have made up their mind to make Canada their destination for good. 

Indian investors should consider Canada and especially the province of Ontario to be the hub of their North American business activities. Ontario has liberal laws, a huge existing infrastructure, and various tax benefits to investors, relatively milder climate, fertile farmlands and, without doubt, some of the best golf courses in the world in your neighborhood. 

People here are well aware of Indian investments in the automotive sector of the UK. During the purchasing phase of the Jaguar and Land Rover deal by Tata, India and its investors were commonly discussed in Ontario bars and restaurants. Ontario is the hub of automotive industries and support services for manufacturing automobiles of big-3: US and Japanese car manufacturers like Honda and Toyota. Southwestern Ontario is a key entry point for US and South American markets. 

Canadians are very knowledgeable about India and its information technology-related successes. India is no longer a nation of beggars and snake- charmers in the minds of a younger generation of Canadian citizens. Growth of the Indian software industry has made a big mark on the Canadian psyche. 

Any investment in Canada will have to be planned over the long term similar to US investors in the past. Canadian oil and energy, forestry, mines and minerals, and gold and diamond resources are some of the best resources for investors to look at. The Canadian higher education system is one of the best in the world and at par with the US, resulting in students from across the globe studying and performing high quality research. 

Investors from India are relatively conservative by nature and prefer to satisfy some critical marks before deciding to invest. Canada is one such country which should be the destination of long-term investors from India. One might look at some of the investments made by Indian investors in the Ontario province and think how much is there on offer in this well-endowed province alone. Investments by Essar group in energy and steel, by Mahindra Satyam and Wipro in the IT sector are a good beginning. However, the quantity of investment is negligible, compared to China, which is making substantial investment in the core sectors of oil and energy, solar and wind power generation and forestry. 

A strategic investment in developed nations like Canada goes with the Indian aspiration of becoming a global power. Indian investors can fulfill such desires in conjunction with the geo-political leadership potential of India.

**WANTED: RBI Governor**

Alright, you knew this was coming. You don’t live under a rock. You’ve heard about this. We have had wall to wall coverage of this story since it broke. And as the most important economic story of the week, it has to be talked about here. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan does not [want](http://in.reuters.com/article/rbi-chief-rajan-quit-idINKCN0Z50N2) a second term. In a message to the RBI staff that was released on the central bank’s website, Rajan has stated his desire to not continue as the governor. Instead, he’s going back to his old teaching job in the US. Apparently, the governor was very much interested in serving a second term. But getting reappointed would mean that he would have to maneuver the delicate political minefield. And Rajan was unwilling to get down and dirty in the intricate interlockings of Indian politics, which has now become more complex than the plot of Game of Thrones. And so, the House of Rajan will now be leaving the show in September. This decision to not continue marks a political victory for the campaign against his reappointment, which was led by Subramanium from the House of Swamy. 


**Flying Higher**

Rule 4/20 is the rule that states you must smoke a little something when the clock strikes 4:20. Rule 5/20 is not as exciting or fun, and only applies to the Indian aviation industry. The 5/20 rule states that any Indian airliner must have 5 years of experience flying domestic routes and must own 20 aircrafts before it can operate any international routes. It might sound like redundant regulation to you, but that’s not how the folks at Jet Airways and SpiceJet see this. To incumbent airliners who already satisfy the rule, this is hugely beneficial since it removes competition on international routes. But to newer airliners like Air Asia who don’t satisfy the rule, this is a lost business opportunity. But a new civil aviation policy approved last week [removed](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-airlines-rules-idINKCN0Z110J) the 5-year experience requirement, however the 20 aircraft rule still stands, making it the 0/20 rule. A big round of FDI reforms has also eased rules for FDI in the aviation industry.

**EU & Britain - The Big Divorce**

Britain, the real reason why Indians love tea and cricket, is going through a messy divorce. In a nation-wide referendum, Britishers will soon vote if they want the country to leave the European Union or stay in the European Union. A popular argument for staying in the EU cites the disastrous effects that the British economy is expected to experience if it leaves. The UK Treasury [says](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/macro-view/talking-point-brexit-and-indian-markets/article8748796.ece) that if Britain leaves, inflation will spike, unemployment will rise, and GDP growth might be 6% lower. But let’s be honest, most of you can’t be bothered to keep up with even the Indian economy. The news is boring, uninteresting, mundane and all the other synonyms of boring. And here is a story asking you to care about the British economy. So before you tune out, know that you should care about this because the global economy is a series of dominos, and one of them might fall next week. Most of the world is urging Britain to stay in the EU. But really, the only evidence that anyone needs to take into consideration is - Donald Trump supports Britain leaving the EU. And that right there, should be enough information for the British people to know which way to vote.

**STILL WANTED: RBI Governor**

You know what? We haven’t talked about this enough. This story deserves another look. The big news of Rajan’s departure was dropped in an open letter that Rajan wrote to the RBI staff. And it caught everyone off-guard, including the government. While Rajan gets ready for his exit interview, the government is busy looking at résumés of candidates to fill his position. The news of his departure isn’t even a week old, but the race to replace him is already starting to heat up. The shortlist has as many as [seven](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/seven-names-on-long-list-to-replace-rbis-rajan-official-1420762) people, but the frontrunner right now is Arundhati Bhattacharya, a high-profile banker who has been at the helm of India's largest lender - State Bank of India. If you think you can make the shortlist, send your CV to: Sansad Marg, Janpath, New Delhi, Delhi 110001. Either way, get ready to bid farewell to Rajan. It sure was good while it lasted, wasn’t it? But like all good things in life, it had to come to an end. Rajan, we had a lot of fun together, didn’t we? Remember when you cut consumer inflation from a high of 11.16% to a low of 3.69%? Yeah.. Good times. And remember when you increased the foreign exchange reserves from $275 billion to $363 billion? Yeah... Those were the days. I’m sorry, I think I need some time alone.

* To stop cheap imports of foreign wheat from messing with the domestic wheat market which employs a lot of farmers, the government levies a duty of 25% on all wheat imports. Last week, the duty which was set to expire this month was [renewed](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/180616/india-extends-25-percent-tax-on-wheat-imports-ram-vilas-paswan.html) for 3 more months. But it might not work as planned. Despite being the world’s 2nd largest producer of wheat, Indian imports of wheat could touch a decade-high this year. Well, at least the government will make a ton of cash off it.

* Technically, Amazon India is not an e-commerce company. It is an online marketplace [that](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/amazon-continues-to-lobby-for-hybrid-ecommerce-model-in-india-116061300365_1.html) connects buyers and sellers. E-commerce is when you sell inventory directly to the buyer. Current regulations don’t allow FDI in e-commerce, which means foreign companies like Amazon can’t enter the e-commerce industry. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently met PM Modi and lobbied him to allow FDI in e-commerce. One can only imagine how frustrated Bezos must’ve felt when they told him that last week, India [eased](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/govt-to-hold-briefing-on-fdi-rules-today/article8751887.ece) FDI rules for 9 industries including aviation, defense, pharma and food processing. Can you guess which industry didn’t make the cut?

* Larsen & Toubro has [bagged](http://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-qatar-idINKCN0YS0P2) a $135 million contract to build a stadium in Qatar for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. $135 million is a lot of money. Qatar’s economy is largely based on oil and prices are not exactly ideal right now. So if you’re wondering how they are even paying for the stadium, wonder no more - The Gulf country has cut planned spending on building hospitals by about two-thirds in 2016 following the drop in oil prices to keep expenditure on its World Cup-related projects unchanged. Those are some solid priorities right there.

* It hasn’t even been a week since the news of Rajan’s departure broke and bad news has already [started](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/wpi-inflation-rises-to-079-in-may-on-higher-food-prices/article8727957.ece) rolling in. Consumer inflation, which halved during Rajan’s tenure, came in at a 21-month high of 5.76% for the month of May. Food prices for the month went up by 7.55%, also a 21-month high. Wholesale inflation, which was negative until two months ago, came in at a 19-month high of 0.76%. RAJAN. THERE IS STILL TIME. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME.

They say there aren’t any free lunches in the world. But at least you don’t get the bill after a free lunch. However, that might soon change. Due to some ambiguity in the GST bill as it stands right now, you could [potentially](http://www.businessinsider.in/Nothing-is-going-to-come-for-free-after-GST-is-implemented-Heres-why/articleshow/52775662.cms) end up paying taxes on things that you get for free.

For a lot of Indians, the festival that brings families and friends together is no longer Diwali. It’s the festival of IPL. The sporting franchise recently concluded its 9th season this year.

A big chunk of that money, as much as ₹1,100 crore went to Sony as the official broadcaster of the IPL. With that kind of cash, it doesn’t matter which team you support or which team wins, the executives at Sony always win.

**Earnings-Palooza Continues**

The festivities for the quarter ending March continued with Airtel [reporting](http://www.firstpost.com/business/bharti-airtels-q4-profits-up-15-per-cent-rise-in-subscribers-for-mobile-internet-2753518.html) a 3% increase in net profits and a subscriber total of 35 million Indians. Airtel’s gain turned out to be Idea’s pain. Shares of Idea traded down after the company [reported](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/markets/indian-markets/idea-cellular-stocks-today-on-bse-sensex-nse-nifty-on-april-29-2016/245221/) almost 40% decrease in profits. That had to have hurt. The main event of the week were the banks that were reporting earnings. Profits at Axis Bank [fell](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/LlwW49im93N1GmvPrUm64H/Q4-results-Axis-Bank-profit-falls-for-the-first-time-in-46.html) almost 2% as bad loans went up - it’s the bank’s first decline in quarterly profits in over a decade. ICICI Bank, the country’s largest private sector bank, [reported](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/icici-bank-q4-profit-hit-by-provisioning-116042900307_1.html) a 76% decline in profits, the sharpest decline of quarterly profits ever in its entire history. Records like that are probably best left unbroken. Just as you breath a sign that after results like those, the worst is probably over - you realize it really isn’t. Both banks said that they expected the amount of bad loans to increase for a few quarters. Shareholders of bank stocks better get used to the pain of being burned by bad loans. Masochist shareholders of bank stocks can relax.


**Maruti Suzuki**: **:’(**

Delhi’s odd-even rule has drawn a lot of flak from residents who are being forced to take the bus every other day and smell the smells of the people on the bus. Among those unhappy has to be Maruti Suzuki, India’s biggest car maker. Maruti’s results for the first quarter of 2016 [reported](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/live-maruti-suzuki-q4-results-fy16-net-profit-sales-revenue-margins/243113/) a 12% decline in profits. Interestingly, the company cites the Jat reservation agitation as one of the reasons for a fall in profits. But there are also people who are happy with the odd-even rule. Like a 13-year old boy who registered the domain odd-even.com and [sold](http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Remember-The-13YearOld-Who-Created-The-OddEven-Website-Has-Now-Sold-It-To-Orahi/) it to carpooling app, Orahi and now attends advisory board meetings at Orahi as a technical expert, presumably right after watching Chota Bheem. Sticking to the theme, chalk this one up as win for the militant environmentalists - Mahindra is planning to [build](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-mahindra-to-build-indias-first-automobile-shredding-plant-2016-4) India’s first automobile shredding plant that will focus on destroying 100,000 units of old cars, ships and machines per year. They should upload videos of machines crushing cars to YouTube.

**Let’s Pretend Like This Is A Creative Title**

Every time there’s technological progress, people piss themselves silly telling everyone that machines will take all our jobs now. That has been happening since the past decade or so and likely started when they invented swords to replace the jobs of all the people who made pointy sticks. But today, there is a special kind of irony when the engineers who make machines and software that replace other people’s jobs start getting replaced by software and machines themselves. One of Infosys’ co-founders says growth in hiring has [decreased](http://www.businessinsider.in/Heres-why-automation-AI-is-good-news-for-IT-companies-and-bad-news-for-you/articleshow/52037635.cms) by 40% over the past 10 years and will likely fall further. And it’s all happening because of automation in the IT industry. There’s only one job available for every five engineers graduating every year. Psh, and they said arts students don’t get jobs. Due to this increased supply and reduced demand, salaries for new hires [stayed](http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate/no-salary-hike-for-freshers-in-it-space-amid-hiring-blues/52019188) pretty much the same despite a booming IT industry. Indians who opted for the road less traveled despite family pressure to pursue engineering cannot stop smiling right now.

**Last Week In Vijay Mallya’s Life**

Not to jump on the bandwagon of hating him because it’s cool now, but that Mallya fellow just can’t stay out of the news media, try as he might. Either that or the news media just can’t stay out of Mallya’s life, and they don’t even try. Brands confiscated by the banks a few weeks ago like ‘Fly the Good Times’ and ‘Fly Kingfisher’ were [put](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/logistics/lenders-begin-auction-of-brand-kingfisher-trademarks/article8540946.ece) on auction for the second time. And for the second time, nobody was stupid enough to make a bid. The minimum price was set at ₹367 crore. It’s safe to say - those brands are poisonous by now. The Supreme Court [directed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sc-directs-vijay-mallya-to-furnish-details-of-assets-in-india-abroad/) Mallya to declare all his foreign and domestic assets to the banks so they can be better prepared at the negotiations table. Mallya isn’t back in the news. He just never left the news. They also just [revoked](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/india-revokes-passport-of-vijay-mallya-who-fled-to-london-owing-13bn) his passport - and being an MP, he’s even got one of those shiny red diplomatic passports, which is now useless. That last sentence was written before news broke that Mallya had [resigned](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vijay-mallya-resigns-from-rajya-sabha/article8547747.ece) from the Rajya Sabha -  so now that shiny red diplomatic passport is really useless.

**Bros Again: Reliance and Iran**

The Iranian Revolution of 1979 overthrew the ruling dynasty in Iran which was supported by the US. Since this was a matter of internal politics in a sovereign country outside the US territory, the US had to respond, as is tradition - and it promptly imposed economic sanctions, which were recently lifted. Reliance, which has substantial investments in the US, had suspended trade with Iran for fears of being dragged through the mud in the US. But last week, Reliance [resumed](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/reliance-buys-iranian-oil-after-6-year-hiatus_6377461.html) buying oil from Iran after almost 6 years. Talking about oil - oil prices have crashed the floor and everyone’s predicting the end of Saudi Arabia as we know it. There was even talk about an IPO for Saudi Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, to raise cash and douse the fire lit by falling oil prices. If there is a fire, the kingdom is trying to hide the smoke. Saudi Aramco is now actually looking to [expand](http://www.indiainfoline.com/article/news-top-story/saudi-aramco-mulling-offers-for-indian-oil-refinery-stakes-pradhan-116042600203_1.html) and buy stakes in Indian petrochemical projects, possibly in a planned oil refinery on the west coast.

**Return Of The Avengers**

Whoever says Hollywood’s superhero movies are unrealistic? The Avengers are actually real. Hollywood’s Avengers was a group of superheroes saving the universe by blowing stuff up. In reality, the Avengers are a group of guys that just blow stuff up for no real reason. The Niger Delta Avengers militant group has been [blowing](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/07/oil-hovers-near-8-month-highs-on-us-inventory-draw.html) up oil wells in Nigeria and has rejected any peace talks with the government. After dropping to dangerous lows of $20, crude oil prices have bounced back and recently crossed the $50 mark. Much of the reason for this rise is simply the forces of supply and demand reacting to each other in a free market. But one of the reasons it touched $50 last week was the Avengers sabotaging oil wells. A lot of investors betting on the resurgence of oil can’t say this out loud, but thank god for terrorist Avengers. However, not everybody is celebrating the return of oil. In the latest policy review, the RBI (which kept interest rates untouched last week), [cited](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/black-gold-a-headache-not-only-for-modi-but-for-raghuram-rajan-too/articleshow/52634156.cms) rising oil prices as a risk. Because when oil prices go up, inflation goes up as well. Personally, I’m just sad that budget cuts forced the Avengers to opt for simple dynamite instead of nuclear-powered Mach-5 flying suits.

**Black Problems**

India has a huge second economy that deals with black money. That’s news to nobody. But a new study has [pegged](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/new-study-pegs-black-money-in-india-at-rs-30-lakh-crore/story/233395.html) the size of that black economy at an astounding 20% of GDP or over ₹30 lakh crore (that’s 3 followed by 13 zeroes). And that just happens to be bigger than the overall economic size of countries like Thailand or Argentina. While the size of India’s black economy expanded rapidly during the 70s and 80s, it has been gradually declining since then. Today, most of this money is locked up in physical assets like real estate or gold. Due to obvious reasons, there are no official figures but experts say that as much as 30% of India’s real estate sector is funded by black money. Really, only in economics can you root for the supremacy of white over black and not be called a ~~Donald Trump supporter~~ racist.

**The Curious Case Of Missing GDP**

How does a 7.9% growth in GDP sound to you? If you ask the average joe on the streets, he won’t know what is what. But if you ask the fairly well-read joe on the streets, he’ll tell you that a 7.9% growth rate is amazing. But what about a 3.9% growth in GDP? Now, that’s bad. Official numbers released last week say that India’s GDP in the March quarter grew by 7.9%. But wait, there’s more. The accuracy of those numbers has been [called](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/kvvDHfbryOQjvu2l16UcEI/Discrepancies-drive-GDP-growth.html) into question. When you break GDP down into its components, sometimes the data doesn’t add up. It’s life. Sometimes, things just don’t add up. So this gap is then plugged by calling the missing portion as a ‘discrepancy’. As long as this discrepancy doesn’t get too big, all is well. But the amount of discrepancy in the latest numbers has shot up by over 350%. And if you remove the amount put under ‘discrepancy’, GDP growth rate falls from 7.9% to 3.9%. Faking GDP numbers? Come on guys, that’s not our job. That’s China’s [job](http://fortune.com/2015/12/14/china-fake-economic-data/).


**Economic Story Because Export and Import**

Nuclear weapons are serious business. Emphasis on serious rather than business. Although a handful of companies do make money off the nuclear power business. When sensitive nuclear technology falls in the wrong hands, you have rogue nations like North Korea and when it falls in the right hands... well, there really aren’t any right hands for nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a group of 48-countries that controls the export and import of goods that can be used to make a nuclear weapon. The NSG does this to ensure that nuclear technology doesn’t fall in the wrong hands. But India is not one of its 48 members. One of the reasons we are not invited to parties thrown by the NSG is because we have nuclear weapons but haven’t signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is an international agreement designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. This is a sore point with a lot of countries like China who are against India joining the NSG. However, being being friends with the United States, the world’s superpower does come with a lot of benefits. A US-led push to include India in the NSG is [picking](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-nuclear-idUSKCN0YV13Z) up steam as nations like South Africa and Turkey are coming around to supporting India’s bid for a membership. Here’s the irony - the only reason the NSG even exists as an international group, is because India tested nuclear weapons in the 70s and that rustled some jimmies in the international community.

The $5 billion funding will take Amazon India past the combined funding raised by both local rivals, Flipkart and Snapdeal.

Earlier this year, the Indian government once again tried to get the famed Kohinoor diamond back from the UK and failed. Citing that it would set an “unworkable precedent”, UK Prime Minister David Cameron [refused](http://www.newsweek.com/kohinoor-diamond-india-colonialism-449951) to return the stone, which has been claimed by the governments of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan at various points as well. That didn’t pan out quite well. But how do 200 statues and sculptures sound instead of 1 big fat diamond? The US  is [returning](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/07/us/stolen-artifacts-returned-india/) more than 200 artifacts that were stolen and smuggled out and eventually just ended up in the hands of the US government. Some of them are as old as 2,000 years and are worth over $100 million.

The government has, for the first time in history, [declared](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/03/india-will-have-surplus-power-for-the-first-time-ever-report) that it will not have a shortage of electricity this year. Baring the small matter of authorities often choosing to black out certain areas to hide demand, from June onwards, the country will have more electricity than required. Psh. Power cut. Shmower Cut.

Am just a normal internet user from some city of India and have been touring out in many different countries from last few years.

I really love my nation and while travelling I found that we have everything what other so called developed countries have than why are we still developing?

I generally came up with few more questions while browsing through so many social networking and news channels and other print media.

I Have 1 general question from all the citizens of this country, Don't you think that the only problem is we are been fooled by few politicians?

Why I came up with this question.
I don't think all other countries with such huge population are safest for women's or they don't have any crime happening or there are no bankrupt or jobless people roaming around, every country has this and this is just a part of it.

What makes difference.
Some countries have low population and so they have managed to have better law and low rate of law breakers, some countries are so open for sex and everything that they don't have sex taboo guys roaming around to harm girls, some countries high rate of literacy and there are huge tax payers and the government is so rich that in very average amount of tax also they manage to serve the best to country and there are some countries which has huge population but they work strictly on business and make more and more vacancies to leave less unemployment in the country.

Now what this country is working on?
I found that none of the political parties are actually trying to solve the issue or jobs and tax payers and if some think of trying it out (not only now but even when congress tried few better step) the oppositions and others just try to criticize them and they try best to fool people and get rid of this solutions and try to misguide the citizens of our country.

Root cause,
No political party is trying for the best awareness and is opened up for space for public voice.

Reason:
Everyone is scared of loosing there position.

I don't say demonetization is right or wrong i am just a common man who has not studied finance or i do not know how gst is effecting people because i was not a trader or so, but i know only one thing that if stop criticizing everything and work together for benefit even for next one 3-4 years i think this country would be most powerful and most dominating in the world in ever space.

With all this criticism, blame game, dirty politics we are not heading towards any solution we are in a loop of destruction we will always be behind few other countries and we will always be developing country because the condition of been developed country keeps varying every generation with the high end techs and literacy.

We need to work together for awareness, jobs, tax payers and food quality rather then seeing who is low level scammer or who is shouting higher.

Please be aware we are not moving towards development if this situation is continued and maximum people stay against government always.

I pardon for my language if i have misspelled or there is a grammatical issues, I am not a blog writer but i am really in pain with the way things are going and if we all don't stand to support any government in position all together we will always be in the same situation forever, and i think this is the right time to open eyes and start supporting because we need a government with majority and this is that government lets support them maximum and give a try we have no other option when you have to bare it anyways why not supporting while voting again don't vote them thats all.

**Banks - Mo’ Money, No Problems**

Two major private sector banks, Axis and HDFC, reported results for the quarter ending June and it’s a mixed bag. The bad loans crisis [continued](http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/axis-bank-q1-results-net-profit-bad-loans-on-july-22-2016/325755/) to hit Axis Bank where profits fell by 21%. But HDFC Bank, which mostly focuses on retail borrowers, [managed](http://in.reuters.com/article/hdfc-bank-results-idINKCN1010ML) to entirely miss the crisis as profits were up by 20%. However, the bag isn’t so mixed when it comes to public sector banks which are riddled with problems. The government’s got 99 problems, and 98 of them probably involve the banking sector in one way or another. Now, one way to solve problems is to just throw money at the problem. And 13 public sector banks just [received](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-allocates-rs-22915-cr-for-psu-bank-re-capitalization_7065221.html) about ₹22,915 crore of cash from the government. A back of the envelope calculation says if they had delivered all that cash physically, it would weigh about 275 kgs. Yes, I did the math. After reserving a lot of money to treat the bad loans problem, the banks didn’t have much remaining to lend out to borrowers. And if banks stop lending money, the entire economy grinds to a halt. So the new capital given by the government is supposed to help them get back into the lending game again. The largest recipient of this capital infusion was our largest bank, the State Bank of India that got about ₹7,575 crore. However, this is only a “capital infusion” and definitely not a “bailout”. Who even said bailout? There’s no bailout here. What bailout?

**ELI5 - GST**

GST - You know it’s a thing. But you don’t have a single clue what it’s about. The only time you hear about it is while changing channels on the TV. And from your drunk uncle at wedding receptions who thinks he’s an expert in politics. The Goods and Services Tax is probably the most important tax reform of this decade. It replaces a whole bunch of indirect taxes such as the VAT, Service Tax or Excise Duty. So instead of paying ten taxes at ten places, you only pay one tax at one place. And cutting down on that paperwork starts a domino effect of good things for the economy. At least that’s the theory. But the bill has been stuck in Rajya Sabha for a long time now. So what’s the big hold up? Political parties have been negotiating the finer details of the bill and the negotiations are taking a little more time than everybody expected. Some sore points of disagreement are whether to place a maximum limit of 18% above which the GST tax rate cannot be raised, whether to levy a 1% surcharge on interstate trade and how to resolve any disputes in the process. But now, if you feel like you aren’t getting enough of our beloved parliamentarians that are so hard at work solving our problems in penthouses all around Delhi, then fear no more. Because the government is [planning](http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/gst-hopes-brighten-as-congress-signals-support-bjp-ready-for-debate-in-rajya-sabha_1908866.html) a 5-hour-long debate in the Rajya Sabha aiming to resolve all disputes and pass the bill once and for all. That’s right, back to back five hours of bickering old men in white clothes - without any commercial breaks.

**Tesla to go desi?**

The pollution in Delhi has reached such an alarming level that if a Delhi resident starts smoking 10 packs of cigarettes a day and garnishing his food with powered nicotine while sleeping in a chamber full of passive tobacco smoke, he’ll probably still die of asthma from the polluted air before the lung cancer gets to him. And then there’s Delhi CM Mr. Kejriwal who recently hinted at the possibility of the torturous odd-even rule returning back to Delhi during the upcoming winters to curb pollution. What the city clearly needs is a whole bunch of emission-free electric cars. And accordingly, the government’s making moves to get Tesla, the car company famous for its electric cars to come to India. Apart from offering to promote joint ventures between Tesla and Indian car companies, the government is even [offering](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/tesla-and-make-in-india-a-roadway-to-cleaner-and-greener-india-but-how-soon-326205.html) Tesla land near major ports so it can Make in India and export to other Asian countries as well. However, the pipe dream of driving a Tesla down the national highways is unlikely to come true for at least a few years. Until then, we’ve got to find other ways to reduce pollution. Such as banning all diesel vehicles older than 10 years, which is what the National Green Tribunal just did. NGT, a top environmental court, has [directed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-autos-court-idUSKCN0ZY12P) Delhi transport authorities to de-register any diesel vehicles older than 10 years, and car companies couldn’t be happier.

~~**Tollywoodonomics**~~  **Kollywoodonomics**

Rajinikanth, the Amitabh Bachchan of the South, was out with his latest movie *Kabali*, which opened last Friday in 6,500 theaters, many of which were sold out for the entire weekend. In the movie industry, you’re only as good as your last flop - and in Rajini’s case, his last movie was *Lingaa* and before that, *Kochadaiiyaan* - both of which - well, let's just say that they haven’t exactly been Spielberg material. So you’d think producers would think twice before betting on this next film - but this Rajini we are talking about. He doesn’t follow the laws of economics. The laws of economics follow Ra... okay, yeah, those jokes stopped being funny 10 years ago. But still, people literally pour milk on huge cutouts of this guy. So producers went all in and funded Kabali with a budget of ₹110 crore. Here’s the kicker - the movie had already [earned](http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/how-rajinikanths-kabali-has-earned-rs-200-crore-days-before-its-release-2902140.html) ₹200 crore even before being released. Music rights, overseas rights, satellite rights and all other kinds of rights had already earned the movie a ton of cash before being released. How much did Rajini make off the movie? The actor was reportedly [paid](http://www.catchnews.com/regional-cinema/revealed-this-is-how-much-rajinikanth-charged-for-kabali-movie-news-rajinikanth-kabali-fees-revealed-1469024603.html) ₹35 crore as acting fees plus he’s set to receive another ₹45 crore from first week collections of the movie at the box office. Rajini being Rajini, theaters were sold out but prices for tickets in black ranged up to ₹1,500 with reports saying fans were ready to pay as much as ₹5,000 for tickets. All of this only points to one thing - at 65-years old, Rajini’s still got some swag.

Specifically, seven Indian companies. But the three top [ranked](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/These-Are-The-Seven-Indian-Which-Companies-Which-Made-It-To-Fortune-500-List/) are - Indian Oil (161st), Reliance (215th) and Tata Motors (226th).

After acquiring PhonePe (a payments startup) this April, Flipkart is [investing](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/07/21/why-flipkart-is-building-a-670-crore-digital-payments-business/) an additional ₹670 crore in the company which is expected to start processing digital payments on Flipkart, Myntra and its logistics service, eKart in the next few weeks.

However, mobile internet packs have stood the test of drought to become best-sellers across rural India. Which, I believe, can be taken as conclusive evidence that even farmers in far-reaching corners of rural India love browsing aww-worthy cat photos on the internet. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, the hardest hit company, is wiping its tears of sadness with the $1.4 billion it earned in profits just last quarter.

High inflation is one of the worst things that can happen to the Indian middle class. As in the type of middle class that earns way less than ₹1.6 lakhs per month.

With a view to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and use of such funds for subversive activities, and for eliminating Black Money ,Government decides to cancel the legal tender character of the High Denomination bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 from the expiry of the 8th November, 2016. 




            With a view to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and use of such funds for subversive activities such as espionage, smuggling of arms, drugs and other contrabands into India, and for eliminating Black Money which casts a long shadow of parallel economy on our real economy, it has been decided to cancel the legal tender character of the High Denomination bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations issued by RBI till now. This will take effect from the expiry of the 8th November, 2016.
 
2.         Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) in circulation in these denominations are comparatively larger as compared to those in other denominations. For a common person, the fake notes look similar to genuine notes. Use of FICN facilitates financing of terrorism and drug trafficking. Use of high denomination notes for storage of unaccounted wealth has been evident from cash recoveries made by law enforcement agencies from time to time. High denomination notes are known to facilitate generation of black money.In this connection, it may be noted that while the total number of bank notes in circulation rose by 40% between 2011 and 2016, the increase in number of notes of Rs.500/- denomination was 76% and for Rs.1,000/- denomination was 109% during this period. New Series bank notes of Rs.500/- and Rs.2,000/- denominations will be introduced for circulation from 10th November, 2016. Infusion of Rs.2,000/- bank notes will be monitored and regulated by RBI. Introduction of new series of banknotes which will be distinctly different from the current ones in terms of look, design, size and colour has been planned.
 
3.         The World Bank in July, 2010 estimated the size of the shadow economy for India at 20.7% of the GDP in 1999 and rising to 23.2% in 2007. There are similar estimates made by other Indian and international agencies. A parallel shadow economy corrodes and eats into the vitals of the country’s economy. It generates inflation which adversely affects the poor and the middle classes more than others. It deprives Government of its legitimate revenues which could have been otherwise used for welfare and development activities.

4.         In the last two years, the Government has taken a number of steps to curb the menace of black money in the economy including setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT); enacting a law regarding undisclosed foreign income and assets; amending the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and Mauritius and India and Cyprus; reaching an understanding with Switzerland for getting information on Bank accounts held by Indians with HSBC; encouraging the use of non-cash and digital payments; amending the Benami Transactions Act; and implementing the Income Declaration Scheme 2016. 

5.         In order to implement the above decisions of the Government and keeping in view the need to minimise inconvenience to the public, the following operational guidelines have been issued:-
 
(i)            Old High Denomination Bank Notes may be deposited by individuals/persons into their bank accounts and/or exchanged in bank branches or Issue Offices of RBI till the close of business hours on 30th December, 2016.

Similar facilities will also be made available in Post Offices.

(vii)      Cash withdrawal from a bank account, over the counter will be restricted to Rs.10,000/- subject to an overall limit of Rs. 20,000/- in a week for the first fortnight, i.e., until the end of business hours on November 24, 2016.

(x)          For those who are unable to exchange their Old High Denomination Bank Notes or deposit the same in their bank accounts on or before December 30, 2016, an opportunity will be given to them to do so at specified offices of the RBI on later dates along with necessary documentation as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of India.

Bloodbath Continues On Stock Market; Sensex Falls 1200 Points - 11 Points You Need To Know,3,7vlecu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7vlecu/bloodbath_continues_on_stock_market_sensex_falls/,0,1517926185.0,"> ""The Sensex and Nifty suffered a bloodbath today, tracking a selloff in global equity markets. Overnight, the Wall Street suffered its biggest intraday decline in history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with a loss of about 1,200 points - nearly 4.6 percent. Shares in other Asian markets were also under strong selling pressure, with Japan's Nikkei down about 5 percent. The Sensex fell as much over 1,200 points to 33,482 while Nifty tumbled below 10,300. The rupee also fell to 64.38 against US dollar, as compared to Monday's close of 64.06.""


* The trigger for the latest global selloff is Friday's job data in US, which showed American wages increasing at the fastest pace since 2009. This has raised alarm about higher inflation and with it potentially higher interest rates.

* In anticipation of the faster-than-expected rate hike from the Federal Reserve - the US central bank, bond yields have spiked in the US, undermining the attraction of equities. Higher bond yields are also seen as negative for emerging markets and commodity prices.

*  Though Finance minister Mr. Arun Jaitley Killed Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency but showed their interest in Blockchain technology, people still likely to [understand all in & Out of Cryptocurrency](https://www.eduonix.com/complete-steemit-course-earn-cryptocurrency-for-free?coupon_code=edu15) as well as interested to purchase it 

* The US central bank had last month kept interest rate unchanged but said inflation would likely rise this year, raising the possibility faster-than-expected rate hikes.

* On the other hand, [global oil prices have dropped](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/business-30691883/why-are-global-oil-prices-falling) amid recent dollar strength, with international benchmark Brent futures hitting a one-month low of $66.90 per barrel earlier this week. A fall in global oil prices is seen as positive for India as the country imports bulk of its requirement.

* Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday attributed the downslide in the local bourses to selloff in global markets. ""It is not due to the Budget or the LTCG (long-term capital gains tax),"" he said.

* Apart from the global selloff, the domestic sentiment has been hit by the Budget announcement of 10 percent tax on long-term capital gains accrued from equity investments, say, analysts. The Sensex fell over 800 points on Friday and over 300 points on Monday.

* The Street would also be closely watching [Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy stance](https://www.ndtv.com/business/rbi-seen-taking-tough-stance-on-inflation-in-monetary-policy-review-1808713) tomorrow. It is expected that RBI could turn more hawkish on inflation after inflation hit a 17-month high in December, well above its 4 percent target.

>  ""We expect the RBI to remain on a pause in this policy. However, the tone will likely be more hawkish with the probability of rate hikes in FY2019 increasing,"" 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

said Suvodeep Rakshit, senior economist at Kotak Institutional Equities.


>""should stay light and avoid making any kind of bottom fishing till the definite signals emerge"".
____________________________________________________________________________

 Ameet Chavan of Angel Broking said, investors 

* The selloff in Indian markets was broad-based with all the stocks in the Nifty50 index trading in the red. Among the big losers, Tata Motors slumped over 7 percent while Axis Bank and Indiabulls Housing Finance plunged nearly 5 percent each.

**Last Week On Rajan Watch**

Last year, PM Modi called RBI Governor Rajan as the “best teacher” for explaining complex economic issues to him. Days later, Rajan said the teaching went both ways. Aww. But the bromance doesn’t end there. Reports saying the PM is “proud” of Rajan surfaced last week [stating](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rajan-insight-idUSKCN0YM2SC) that any campaign against Rajan will not affect the big decision that he needs to make on Rajan’s reappointment. That might’ve been a snide reference to MP Subramanian Swamy’s moves to remove Rajan, Swamy has even rebuked Rajan for “speaking like a grandfather” (what? with artificial teeth? I mean Rajan is already 53, while Swamy is 76). Being best buds with Modi will definitely help Rajan secure his governorship at the RBI for a second term. But then, later in the day, reports [surfaced](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-doesnt-want-extension-media-report/articleshow/52536142.cms) that Rajan doesn’t even want to continue as Governor and would rather be a spectator in the game by going back to teach in the US and continue research on the Indian economy. Apparently, his family has already left. Somebody better buy the rights to this reality show - I’m personally hanging by the edge of my seat. Rajan is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the interest rate meeting this week. And the markets are expected to worry more about the “Rexit” - Rajan exiting the RBI than the interest rates this week. 

**Lincoln Could Only Do So Much**

When you have North Korea, Uzbekistan, Cambodia and Qatar at the top of a list - you pretty much know that the it isn’t the list of world’s happiest countries, it just has to be a list about something bad. Last week, India [shared](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-18-35-million-people-india-tops-global-slavery-index-1413891) a spot on such a list with all of these countries and it was the list that ranks countries in terms of slavery. Yikes. Owning a person might’ve gone out of fashion decades ago, but the trend is still alive - With a global figure of 46 million modern-day slaves, India is home to 18 million of those modern-day slaves followed by 3 million in China and 2 million in Pakistan that are implicated in domestic work, prostitution, manual labour, forced begging and so on. Even in manufacturing, working conditions at factories contribute a lot to the problem by essentially turning employees into slaves. Prominent for workplace [violations](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/01/gap-walmart-factory-workers-exploited-and-abused-in-india) are factories that supply global multinationals like Walmart or Gap. They’ve been known to have working conditions that don’t just border on exploitation - but are miles away from that border, deep into exploitation territory. Complaints include non-payment of wages, forced overtime work, inability to form unions, extreme health consequences that may be fatal due to lack of safety regulations and even sexual harassment. How’s that 9-to-5 desk job sounding now?


**Follow The Money?**

In 2014, between the time when Modi was elected and the time when Modi was sworn-in as the PM, the Sensex was [up](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/narendra-modi-vs-bse-sensex/) 1,685 points. Clearly, the stock market loves Modi. But Modi thinks of the stock market as just a friend. Asset disclosures have [revealed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/pm-modi-top-ministers-stay-clear-of-stocks-keep-assets-in-realty-banks/articleshow/52413153.cms) that the PM has 79% of his total assets, which amount to a total of ₹26.1 lakh, in real estate and a big fat 0% in stocks. The stock market was friend-zoned not just by the PM, but by his cabinet as well. While the total assets of the top 9 ministers in the Indian government amounted to a staggering ₹91.1 crore, only 2% of them were invested in the stock market. The richest of the bunch was Arun Jaitley, perhaps appropriately the Finance Minister, who has total assets of ₹49.5 crore, a significant portion of which is just cold hard cash sitting as bank deposits. The poorest of the bunch was Suresh Prabhu, perhaps also appropriately the Railway Minister, who has total assets of mere ₹17 lakh. You want to talk about the gap between the rich and the poor? We’ve got that gap right here for you in government’s *navratnas*. 

**Time for Tim: Cook’s India Aftermath**

Tim came, Tim saw but Tim did not conquer. Tim Cook, Apple CEO, visited India a few weeks ago to much media fanfare and met several top government ministers. But to Tim’s disappointment, he failed to convince anyone to allow Apple to launch its famous retail iStores in India. Currently, Apple sells products through a network of dealers. That’s because under current regulations, if Apple wants to open retail stores, it needs to source 30% of content locally. Sourcing 30% locally means Apple would have to start manufacturing in India. Either that, or just buy stuff from local businesses and literally light it on fire. Neither of those things is about to happen. However, under current regulations, Apple can be granted a waiver to the 30% rule but only if Apple is bringing “cutting-edge” technology to India. And in the classic bureaucratic fashion, nobody actually bothered to define what “cutting-edge” would mean. And when you leave crucial terms like that open for interpretation, somewhere somehow a lawyer gets all excited. Now, Apple fanboys might disagree on this but government officials are unlikely to call any of Apple’s technology “cutting-edge” and are widely [expected](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/lDn53REhqvhqGoIxs9MgwJ/Apples-proposal-to-sell-refurbished-iPhones-in-India-reject.html) to decline Apple’s petition for a waiver of the 30% rule. The government is also not a big fan of Apple’s proposal to sell second-hand iPhones in India fearing that the country would become a graveyard for all old iPhones.

* Startups always describe themselves as the Google of this, or the Facebook of that, to the point that it’s become one of the annoying buzzwords of the startup world. While startups always envy such internet giants all year round, they didn’t last week. New rules imposing a levy (called the “Google Tax”) of 6% on anyone who does business of more than ₹1 lakh in a year with foreign online advertising services [kicked](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/corporates/article-google-tax-kicks-in-from-today-5-things-to-know-1414318) in from last week. And so it’s been a bad week for foreign online advertising services like Google or Facebook or Yahoo. But really, if you are Yahoo - every week is a bad week.

Turns out, all the Garfield-esque Monday back-to-work hate might just be a myth. The Edenred-Ipsos Barometer (that's a mouthful!), a yearly survey of well-being at work, has [ranked](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-opportunities/indian-employees-say-their-workplaces-promote-wellbeing/article8674930.ece) Indians at the top when it comes to having positive feelings about work. From 14,400 people in 15 countries, 88% of Indian employees report being satisfied about their work. So if you truly hate your job with a passion - you might be in the minority.

* People do crazy things for love? Try money. Questionable ponzi schemes have taken billions as investments by promoting impossible business ventures like tree plantations and even farming emus, the flightless bird. But here’s the thing with ponzi schemes - they seem to work, until one day they don’t. New legislation [proposed](http://qz.com/695185/finally-india-wants-to-clamp-down-on-savings-schemes-that-have-duped-investors-of-billions-of-dollars/) by the government aims to streamline the process for investigating ponzi schemes and to impose strict jail terms up to 10 years for offenders.
 
* Mahindra & Mahindra makes most of it’s money by selling trucks and tractors. And if you’re reading this, there’s a healthy chance that you’ve bought neither a truck, nor a tractor. The appeal of this series hasn’t gone that mainstream... yet. But just because the company mostly deals behind your back, it doesn’t mean the company isn’t making money. After [launching](http://www.financialexpress.com/auto/news/mahindra-q4-net-profit-jumps-14-4-on-better-uv-tractor-sales/269398/) nine products during the last fiscal year, net profit at M&M for the three months ending March was up 14% to ₹668 crore.

*“I am silent because there is conflict between my scholarly commitment to economics and my loyalty to the party's decided issues.”* - Subramanian Swamy, member of parliament [tweeting](http://www.thestatesman.com/news/india/subramanian-swamy-mum-on-gst-cites-party-loyalty/158145.html) about why he is silent on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill that his political party supports so much.

**Going Gaga Over GST**

Last week, the Rajya Sabha [passed](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/gst-bill-pass-what-next-step-by-step-until-the-rollout-2952723/) the Goods and Services Tax (GST) - the tax reform that has been heralded as the most important piece of legislation in over a decade. While the common market of Europe is walking backwards due to Brexit, the common market within India is stepping ahead due to GST. The bill has been the subject of political bickering for a long time now. However, it was passed with 203 votes for and none against. With 0 votes against. They didn’t even blink twice, so you know there families weren’t being held hostage and all votes were entirely voluntary. But this has only been the tip of the iceberg. Even though both houses of the parliament have passed the bill, there is a laundry list of things that need to happen before we can all go home and forget about this whole GST business. The Lok Sabha needs to approve the bill once again. Then, a minimum of 15 state governments need to pass the bill. Then, the president needs to sign the bill. Then, a GST Council needs to be formed and the GST tax rate needs to be negotiated. Then, the central government needs to pass two supporting laws, and each state needs to pass a separate supporting law. And only then, we’ll be able to pocket all that cash from the GST-led economic growth that is being predicted. The deadline set for all of this is April 1st, 2017. Till then, government officials around the country are set to debate on extremely sensitive issues like whether cream biscuits should be taxed at the same rate as ordinary biscuits. #TeamBourbon.

**Uber-Didi**

Uber joined the long list of American MNCs that came to do business in China but inevitably fell on their faces. In a deal announced last week, the popular ride-hailing service will sell its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in [exchange](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/business/dealbook/china-uber-didi-chuxing.html?_r=0) for a 20% stake in Didi, who will invest $1 billion in Uber. The two giants have been battling for the Chinese market for years and despite spending billions of dollars, no one has managed to turn a profit. In fact, Uber was facing a loss of $1 billion annually due to heavy competition in China. Once upon a time, Uber’s future in China seemed to hold promise. And now, the company is throwing in the towel. The company’s mistake? It tried to fight a land war in Asia. Although Didi was the bigger company in China in terms of market share, Uber did have its moments. Such as when a Chinese hip-hop artist posted a gangster rap song about how much he prefers Uber. Don’t Baidu it - China being China censored the whole thing just days later.

**Loans For *Pani Puri wala*s**

Banks use all sorts of fancy algorithms to determine if a borrower will repay a loan. Despite all of that, with the banking crisis, a huge amount of loans are at a risk of being Vijay Mallya-ed. So the fancy algorithms haven’t exactly worked out. Another one of those fancy things that banks use is a credit score. A good credit score will have banks lining outside your door shouting for your attention. A bad credit score will have you lining outside the door of the banks with a ton of paperwork. You need a good credit score to get loans. But to get a good credit score, you need to repay loans. So you see the chicken-and-egg problem here. This means a lot of people don’t even have credit scores. But those people still need loans. And banks won’t touch them with a ten-foot pole. Now, microfinance companies like Edelweiss, Bharat Financial, DHFL and many more are going places feared by the big boys of finance. A big push in the industry is to loan [money](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/saturated-cities-now-even-idli-vada-seller-can-get-loan/articleshow/53515598.cms) to pavement hawkers, scrap dealers and other self-employed individuals. For example - the makers of the extremely healthy chinese food at the hand-kart that parks near the local sewer every evening. Basically, giving loans to low-income borrowers without a credit score or any kind of formal financial history. If that sounds like a recipe for trouble, that’s because it is and we’ve already had that dish in the run-up of the financial crisis of 2008. And if history isn’t repeating itself here, it’s definitely rhyming.


**Too Many Branches Spoil The Bank**

The State Bank Of India has almost 17,000 branches which is very impressive. Especially since they get to brag about it in tables that rank banks by number of branches. But the bank isn’t doing itself any favours by putting 5 branches within a 1 km radius of each other, as is the case a lot of times with SBI. Because sometimes, it’s not the size that matters, it’s what you do with it that matters. And SBI is [considering](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/sbi-weighs-plan-to-shut-relocate-30-of-its-branches/articleshow/53494912.cms) a proposal to do away with such extra branches by consolidating them. It might make common sense to shut down branches when put like that, but then they won’t get to brag about how many branches they have. And investors love those kind of things. SBI is currently in the process of merging with its associate banks from Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore and so on. It expects to have that completed by March 2017. At which point, that 17,000 number will balloon up to 24,000 branches, compounding that problem. A global consulting firm, McKinsey which was hired by SBI has recommended shutting down upto of 7,200 of those branches. Moreover, bank branches are so *2000s*. Online is where it’s at.

This would’ve happened a lot sooner if only the moon had some oil. Helium-3 is all fine... But it’s no oil.

**Big Oil To Get Fatter**

One of the ideas being thrown around to deal with the bad loans crisis was merging all 27 state-owned banks to make 6 really huge banks. Taking inspiration from that idea, the government is now throwing around another idea - [merging](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/government-set-to-start-talks-on-merging-13-state-oil-companies-to-create-behemoth/articleshow/53371857.cms) 13 big state-owned oil companies to make 1 really huge oil company. Companies like ONGC, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum lead the list of the 13 companies being considered for this mega-merger. Even as oil prices nearly committed suicide last year, just the top 6 state-owned oil companies still managed to report revenues of ₹9.3 trillions. So clearly, the 1 giant oil company that will come out of these mergers will be big enough to rival the likes of UK’s BP and Russia’s Rosneft. But it will still be a few ranks smaller than some of the biggest oil companies in the world. And at least when it comes to business, size does matter. This idea of merging oil companies isn’t a new idea - it’s been brought up and shot down numerous times in the past mainly due to concerns over reduced competition. Mergers are extra difficult for government companies because after every merger, there’s some extra fat that you have to trim. But government companies tend to focus on social welfare before profit - which means keeping that extra fat to pump up employment in the country. Even if the prospect of this 1 giant oil company with trillions in revenue seems huge right now, rest assured, it won’t be bigger than *yo mama*.

**Gone Are The Days Of Jabong**

The e-commerce industry made multiple headlines last week - the biggest story being the acquisition of Jabong. Flipkart-owned Myntra went shopping around for companies and [dropped](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/rocket-internets-jabong-sold-to-flipkart-owned-rival-myntra-for-70m/) $70 million on Jabong, creating the largest online fashion company. The second-highest bidder for Jabong was Snapdeal which offered $50 million followed by Future Group (that owns the Big Bazaar stores) which offered $35 million. It’s been a tough couple of years for Jabong. Even Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla of the e-commerce business, briefly considered acquiring Jabong for $1 billion back in 2014. Compared to that price tag, Flipkart got a nice discount of 93%. However, the days aren’t as rosy as they sound for Flipkart. Exhibit A - the company just [fired](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/start-ups/article-flipkart-to-lay-off-hundreds-of-underperforming-employees-report-1437780) about 700 employees and tried to play it off as “a fairly common practice”. Exhibit B - Industry reports released last week indicate that Amazon has [surpassed](http://www.firstpost.com/business/most-consumers-preferred-amazon-over-flipkart-for-online-transactions-in-2016-says-survey-2915798.html) Flipkart to become India’s preferred online destination. Exhibit C - Snapdeal reached 1 million daily transacting users, more than those of Flipkart and Amazon put together. Seems like bad news does come in threes.

**RIO MMXVI**

The 2016 Olympic Games are set to begin next week in Brazil. As the media begins extensive coverage of the events, get ready for the millions of Indians that will be shocked to find out about the existence of sports other than cricket and fighting trolls online. Just as the international media came at India with pitchforks drawn for botching up the 2010 Commonwealth Games, let’s turn those pitchforks around and poke other countries for mismanaging international sporting events. The host nation, Brazil is going through its worst economic crisis since 1930 and its worst health crisis since 1918. The country’s GDP contracted by 4% in 2015, and is expected to [contract](http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-02-22/budget-rio-olympics-16-times-higher-budget-combat-zika-virus) by another 3% in 2016. Plus there’s the small matter of Zika viruses roaming around giving birth defects to unborn babies. Technically, the country doesn’t have a President since the most recent one was suspended under charges of corruption. Considering all of that, just the fact that Brazil hasn’t descended into anarchy is an achievement. The government has allocated $9.7 billion for the Olympic Games, which is 16 times more than the budget allocated to deal with the Zika virus that has already infected 1.5 million Brazilians. Hashtag Priorities. However, every Olympic Game since 1968 has exceeded its budget by an average of 179% which means that $9.7 billion could very well balloon up to $17 billion. Godspeed Brazil, godspeed.

**News Flash: Old Age Is Tough**

Most people’s idea of preparing for retirement includes investing in 1) Fixed Deposits, 2) Mutual Funds or 3) A kid or two. But a survey by the investment bank HSBC [found](http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/finance/47-indians-not-saving-for-retirement-hsbc_1908299.html) that 47% of the working people in India haven’t even started saving for retirement. No need to panic - the global average is around the same at 46% - so the rest of the world is as deep in this swamp as India. The HSBC survey also found the 80% of Indians seek advice about retirement from friends and family - which basically means that your primary source of information about retirement is that one balding uncle you have who walks around with a beer belly and midlife crisis. That’s just one survey. Here’s another - the annual Global Retirement Index published by Natixis, one of the biggest asset management companies in France, [ranked](http://qz.com/737382/india-is-the-worst-place-in-the-world-to-retire-2/) India as the 43rd best country to retire. That doesn’t seem so bad until you realize that the Index only tracks 43 countries to begin with, and India finished last. Dispelling any notions that India finished last due to all the nice guys in the country, the index mentioned the pitiful state of India’s healthcare system as one of the reasons that we finished last. Meanwhile, Norway and Switzerland were ranked as the best places to retire.

**The Rain Gods Want Beer And IPL**

Maharashtra is suffering from a major drought, which is a big deal because hospitals in the severely hit areas have had to cancel operations due to water shortages. It’s so bad that SS* President Uddhav Thackeray has [asked](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/maharashtra-drought-water-crisis-latur-govt-should-stop-water-supply-to-beer-units-in-view-of-drought-shiv-sena-chief-2756485/) the government to stop supplying water to breweries in the state. There’s more. The Mumbai High Court has also [ordered](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36038026) 13 IPL Cricket matches to move out of the state (cricket matches use up a ton of water). You know it’s bad when they go after cricket and beer. The rain gods got a wind of what was happening and have decided to stop the madness before riots break out. The Indian Meteorological Department, which predicts rainfalls among other things, has [predicted](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Economy-set-for-boost-as-Met-forecasts-above-normal-monsoon/articleshow/51802516.cms) “above normal” rainfall this year that may break the two-year long drought and help revive a weak farm economy. Take it with a grain of salt since these are only predictions but they have been supported by two private forecasters as well.

*Shiv Sena, not the Nazis.

**Some Good Numbers**

Several agencies just unloaded a big data dump and while the data isn’t always good, this time it is. Consumer Price Inflation [slowed](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/retail-price-inflation-slows/article8467622.ece) to 4.83% in March, the lowest it has been in 6 months. The price declines were led by the ‘food and beverage’ segment. Who doesn’t love cheap food? Industrial Output broke a 3-month negative streak to grow by 2% in February while electricity production grew by 10% in the same month. All those foreign tours are paying off - despite a decrease from 2014 numbers, recent numbers show India as the world’s largest remittance recipient in 2015 after NRIs [sent](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/India-is-top-remittance-recipient-of-2015-World-Bank/articleshow/51822766.cms) back $69 billion (₹459,988 crore) to families in India. Economists around the country are calling it the “Karan Johar effect”. But that also works the other way around - outward remittances from India grew by over 300% to reach $499 million (₹3,326 crore). Although bank deposits grew by 10%, it’s the slowest growth rate since 1963. But that could also indicate increased consumer spending which can be good for the economy - depends on if you’re a glass half-full or half-empty kind of person.

**No Smoking - Part 2**

Part 1 Recap: The size of the pictorial health warnings that go over cigarette packets was increased from 20% to 85%. Confusion over the decision prompted cigarette manufacturers including ITC ([ITC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AITC)) to shut down all cigarette factories in protest. And now…

Part 2: Turns out - all that drama was over nothing. Cigarette manufacturers, having realized that the government can stay adamant longer than they can stay in business, have decided to [resume](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/itc-to-resume-cigarette-manufacturing/story/231126.html) cigarette manufacturing. But that doesn’t mean the end of this saga. While the mainstream cigarette brands have resumed production, now the traditional cigarette makers that make *beedis*, have [shut](http://in.reuters.com/article/tobacco-industry-supreme-court-appeal-idINKCN0XB1H6) down production because the “wrapping paper edges prevent printing on a reasonably large area of the curved surface”. The beedi industry employs more than 8.8 million Indians mostly in rural impoverished areas, who might be temporarily out of a job. A lawsuit challenging the size increase has already made its way to the Supreme Court which is set to hear the case on April 22nd.

Stay tuned for Part 3 - Coming Soon.

**TCS’s US Troubles**

A grand jury in the United States has [held](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/tcs-denies-ip-infringement-will-appeal-940-million-jury-award-in-us-trade-secrets-theft-case/articleshow/51855594.cms) Tata Consultancy Services ([TCS](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATCS)) in violation of copyright and intellectual property laws and asked the company to pay a fine of $940 million (₹6,266 crore). In October 2014, Epic Systems, an American healthcare software provider, filed a lawsuit accusing TCS of stealing trade secrets, confidential information and more than 6,000 secret documents in order to improve its own competing product called ‘Med Mantra’. And now, the jury has found that TCS did indeed do all those things. TCS, part of the Tata Group known for its integrity and ethics, has denied all allegations. Cheap ripoffs of Western products and brands is usually China’s ball game. But hey, if it works, why not? Except this time, it turned out to be not so cheap - $940 million is close to half of Epic Systems annual revenue.

**Greybull Capital To The Rescue!**

Tata Steel ([TATASTEEL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATATASTEEL)), after a year of intensive searching has found a scapegoat that’s willing to buy a part of its loss-making UK operations. The company is [selling](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/tatas-sell-uk-unit-to-greybull-for-1/235275/) a part of its failing business in the UK to private equity investor Greybull Capital (not to be confused with Red Bull, provider of wings). You don’t really understand the extent to which the Tatas were desperate until you hear that the UK business was sold for just a nominal sum of £1 (94 rupees) and the current pension obligations for employees will still stay with the Tatas. The search for buyers for the remaining parts of the business is still on. However, this has not scared the company off Europe in any way. Tata Steel was [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tata-steel-thyssenkrupp-idINKCN0XA0F0) to be in talks with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp (thi-sen-krup) to merge their European businesses under a joint venture.

RBI slashed the interest rate on credit card dues after I sent a petition to the Honorable Prime Minister,309,2vw8p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2vw8p6/rbi_slashed_the_interest_rate_on_credit_card_dues/,61,1423968456.0,"Last year in May 2014, I had sent a letter about profiteering by Indian banks to the Prime Minister's Office, on the day when Mr Narendra Modi took charge. This letter mentioned several points about how banks were exploiting consumers. Some were even charging money for cash withdrawals and for counting currency. I also suggesting ways and means to make life easier for entrepreneurs and tax payers.

The entire letter can be found on my blog.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/18/letter-mr-narendra-modi-prime-minister-india-prevent-profiteering-indian-banks-and-make-lif

After over 35 years of credit cards being introduced in India, RBI has asked all banks to bring down interest rates. For all these years there has never been a cap on how much interest credit card companies could charge. Now, there will be. I'm amazed the way Modi ji and his government has acted to protect the interest of banking customers who have been exploited for decades by banks and credit card companies.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Interest-on-card-dues-set-to-drop/articleshow/46225962.cms

This was covered by Business World magazine

http://www.businessworld.in/news/banking/how-to-stop-profiteering-by-banks-&-make-life-easier-for-taxpayers/1381616/page-0.html

The Prime Minister's office (PMO) sent me a reply a few weeks later, turning my letter into a petition. A few months later I received two replies from the Reserve Bank of India and one reply from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) addressing the capital market reforms I had suggested.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/22/sebi-sends-me-letter-responding-my-letter-honorable-prime-minister

One of the arguments that I put forth in my letter was about excessive interest rates being charged on credit card outstanding dues. To quote from my letter;

*The credit card division of banks needs to be looked at very seriously. Most banks that issue credit cards charge anywhere between 24% and 36% per annum as interest on the funds lent. Most people are not financially very savvy and this sends them into a debt trap. There is no justification for charging 36% on credit card advances when a loan to buy a scooter can be given at 15%.*

With this move, the RBI has implemented my suggestion. To quote the RBI report; *'Interest rates charged on credit card overdue were inordinately high and out of alignment with other products with similar risk profiles'.* The decision on trimming charges was taken at a conference attended by bank ombudsmen and the top rung of the RBI, which included governor Raghuram Rajan. The conference resulted in action points being drawn for the Indian Banks' Association. 

It is very heartening to see the agility with which the government has responded to my suggestions. This will, I hope, go a long way in giving a fair deal to banking consumers, increasing their purchasing power and improving the quality of life of the common man.

I also wrote a letter last month to the Honorable Finance Minister suggesting a Janta Credit Card, to eliminate black money from the economy. Please read it.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/23/my-letter-honorable-finance-minister-shri-arun-jaitley-suggesting-janta-credit-card-elimina

I'm hopeful that the PM and FM will consider implementing this solution. Apart from eliminating black money, it can go a long way towards ensuring inclusive growth, reducing the gap between the haves and have-nots, increasing India's competitiveness and ensuring employment and GDP growth.

**tl;dr: I sent a letter to the Honorable Prime Minister offering several suggestions to counter profiteering by banks, encourage entrepreneurship and reform taxation. One of the suggestions was to slash the interest rate on credit card dues. This was implemented yesterday, 35 years after credit cards were introduced in India. For the first time in our history we may actually have a cap on credit card interest rates in our country.**",6

The rates at which the Adani Group bagged land from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government for its port and special economic zone (SEZ) project — between Re 1 and Rs 32 per square metre — were much lower than other companies that set up units in the state.  Tata Motors was given 1,110 acres for its Nano car plant in Sanand (near Ahmedabad) at Rs 900 per sq mt, Ford India paid at Rs 1,100 per sq mt for 460 acres close by, while India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, bought about 700 acres in Hansalpur at Rs 670 per sq mt.

Special Economic Zones Rules, 2016, were amended by the department of commerce, to insert a provision on claims for refund under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005. The SEZ Act under which the SEZ Rules are framed did not initially provide any provision for refunds of any kind before this amendment was introduced. The Adani Power Ltd. has claimed that it has paid customs duty on raw ¬materials and consumables – that is, coal imported for the generation of electricity. However, documents leaked to the EPW clearly indicate that the APL had not, in fact, paid the duty on raw materials and consumables amounting to approximately Rs 1,000 crore that had fallen due at the end of March 2015.

The Adani group allegedly took out over Rs 5,000 crore to tax havens, using inflated bills for the import of power equipment from South Korea and China, the SIT on black money was told by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The Adani group vehemently denies any wrongdoing. Modi, after his rhetoric-filled ride to power, has been silent. Since Modi’s ascension to office, what has happened in the ED, which had registered a preliminary case against Adani in Ahmedabad and was handed details of DRI findings, is illustrative. The officer heading the Ahmedabad branch of the directorate was raided by the CBI, which accused him of possessing disproportionate assets. It failed to prove anything at all, despite months of investigation. The two senior-most officers in the Mumbai regional office, who oversaw the investigations in Ahmedabad, were forced out of the agency. The tenure of Rajan S. Katoch, who was heading the directorate when the case was opened, also ended abruptly.

Keeping that in mind no wonder in future Blockchain technology will replace all mediatory authorities from financial transaction & Indians will start to [learn fundamental knowledge of Blockchain technology](https://www.eduonix.com/blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ethereum-essentials)

The distributed ledger technology is becoming a hot favorite in Asia’s third-largest economy for solidifying information, alerting all stakeholders, and preventing tampering. So much so that, in his budget speech on Feb. 01, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced plans to adopt blockchain technology.

> “The government will explore the use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in the digital economy,” 

Jaitley said.

Most commonly known as the technology underpinning the likes of bitcoin and Ether (of Ethereum-fame), blockchain is a digitized and decentralized public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Stripping away the financial application, blockchain is essentially a bookkeeping platform that can be accessed by anybody on the internet but is owned by nobody.

> “Once you have a blockchain, the big spreadsheet in the cloud serves as a record-keeping system that can’t be forged and can’t be reversed,” 

said Nicolas Cary, the co-founder, and president of [Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/) (the company, not the technology).

**Eager governments**

Blockchain technology is already making waves in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

The government there is working with Swedish startup ChromaWay to set up a blockchain-based land registry system that allows people to collateralize property, get loans, and invest against that asset. Tracking property ownership using blockchain allows people to circumvent disputes, frauds, and errors, while also lessening the administrative hassle of registrations and title transfers.

Beyond land registries, blockchain can also put an end to other fraud like identity theft. To reduce the chances of getting hacked, a growing concern in India, the web-based platform can manage digital IDs. 

>“Currently, if you sign up or pay for something on the internet, you turn over unencrypted personal info that gets stored all over internet…creating a honeypot that attracts attackers to breach that service,” 

Cary said. 

With blockchain, only encrypted, relevant information will be released whenever necessary.

Recently, the Maharashtra government called upon industry leaders, researchers, and others to devise ways of incorporating blockchain in e-governance operations. 

> “The government is one of the biggest data creators and data consumers. Blockchain will bring in more efficiency, transparency, accountability, and accessibility in data flows,” 

the state’s chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, said at the Maharashtra Technology Summit (MTech) on Jan. 17.

Amid all the talks of curbing cryptocurrencies, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, still believes that blockchain technology is ripe for adoption. Banks in India are already relying on blockchain to enable overseas transactions, international remittances, and other processes.

The spread of blockchain use in the private sector use of in industries like insurance, healthcare, manufacturing, among others, could also lessen significant burdens that befall the government.

> “Capitalising on the blockchain technology could open new ways of securing peer-to-peer lending transactions, boosting trade finance, fintech and information repository sectors,”

aid Sapan Gupta, the national practice head of banking and finance at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.

> “By segregating the use of blockchain from crypto-currencies reflects the government’s intention to use the technology in a gradual and safer manner before it gets into concepts like replacing currencies.”

**Positive side-effects**

Using blockchain to monitor supply chains means the journey of a good can be tracked from sourcing to their sale by collecting information in the secured cloud-based ledger.

For instance, in the food and retail industry, shipments can be tracked and digitally recorded via a blockchain in real time.

> “This can save lives in the event of an outbreak of food-borne illness,” 

Daniele Bianchi, an assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School, said. 

> “This is obviously helpful both for consumers and the government. Especially in emerging economies whereby the supply chain is typically not easy to track.”

Just like identity theft becomes harder, meddling with critical digital assets—like patient consent records in the healthcare sector or insurance payouts—also becomes less of a concern since no single authority can modify the records. At Bajaj Finserv, the holding company of Bajaj Group’s non-banking financial company (NBFC) and insurance firms, blockchain technology is being used to simplify travel insurance claims. If a flight is delayed, that information comes to the system and the claim amount is automatically generated and paid without the customer having to even file a claim.

There are currently over 40 Indian startups working on blockchain technologies in various industries like finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and logistics, according to Sangeeta Devni, a programme manager at the IT industry trade body NASSCOM’s 10,000 startups initiative. But real-world applications are still few.

**Still learning**

After interviewing early adopters, both on the customer side and vendor side, consultancy firm Deloitte recognised a slew of deterrents to using blockchain technology (pdf) that exist in the Indian market. From a lack of awareness to a dearth of trustworthy vendor partners to cybersecurity concerns, various challenges persist.

> “The main danger comes from hacking, that is, the innovation of the blockchain brings new type of attacks which are far less understood and much less mitigated as those occurring in conventional database management architectures,” 

Bianchi warned.

**7th Pay Commission**

If entrepreneurship is where ambitions get fulfilled, a 9-to-5 bureaucratic government desk job is where ambitions get killed. A government job is an excellent way to start your career, if what you want is to also end your career in a government job because once you’re in there, you really need to screw up big time to be thrown out. How big? You could even skip work for 24 years before being fired like [this](https://www.rt.com/news/221543-india-government-employee-fired/) guy. Along with the literally fire-proof long-term job security, there’s also the chance of making a little buck from time to time with bribes - although few will admit it. But the jobs do come with the downside of being low paid. And the government is working to change that. Every ten years since independence, the government appoints a “pay commission” that recommends what to change in the salaries of over 1 crore government employees and pensioners. The government recently accepted the recommendations of the 7th and the latest pay commission which include an average pay hike of about 24%. It [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/7th-pay-commission-salary-hike-govt-salary-hike-arun-jaitley-2886723/) spending an additional ₹1 lakh crore (that’s 1 followed by 12 zeros) annually to accommodate increased salaries and pensions. Some of the money will presumably go right back into government coffers through taxes. But a range of other issues have stuck out as thorns and lakhs of government employees have threatened to go on strike if they remain unresolved.

**The Banks Need A Stress Ball**

It's been a long, long time since the RBI’s crusade against bad loans in the banking system started. But it doesn’t show any signs of stopping in the near future as the situation has only deteriorated. And if things continue going downhill, banks like the Bank of Maharashtra will probably have to switch slogans from ‘One Family One Bank’ to ‘One Bank One Bankruptcy’. The most recent round of stress tests at the RBI indicate that the banks are in desperate need of a vacation to de-stress for a little bit. The central bank [warned](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/stability-of-banks-has-worsened-significantly/article8784540.ece) that stability in the banking system has significantly worsened since mid-2010s. There is no use praying for the speedy recovery of our banking system as even the RBI did not exactly sound optimistic. At minimum, the central bank expects the amount of bad loans to rise from 7.6% this year to 8.5% next year. And at maximum, that figure can reach 9.3%. Profitability at the banks is in the dumps, having gone [down](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/takeaways-from-rbis-stress-test-banks-very-close-to-tipping-point/articleshow/52967108.cms) by 43% due to write-offs. Looking back at this mess, you can’t help but wonder what will happen if the banking crisis hits a tipping point, if the Punjab National Bank goes from ‘The Name You Can Bank Upon’ to ‘The Name That Just Went Bankrupt’.

**One Giant Leap for ISRO**

Every time ISRO makes news with a launch, you get that occasional story in your social feed that you like without reading and feel proud for about an hour, space exploration replaces Salman Khan on the list of things people care about, #ISRO trends on twitter, NRIs get that occasional feeling of guilt over contributing to brain drain and Shahrukh Khan is relevant because Swades. Well, here’s the story that you might’ve already seen and liked without reading: last week, ISRO made news in the global space commerce industry by [launching](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/isro-throws-satellite-making-open-to-private-sector-1423043) 20 satellites in one rocket. 17 of the 20 satellites were from foreign customers of Antrix, the commercial arm of ISRO.  It’s really anyone’s guess how much Antrix or ISRO charges for one satellite launch, but Antrix did report revenues of over ₹1,800 crore in 2015. But the launch wasn’t the only ISRO event making news. AS Kiran Kumar, chairman of ISRO invited the private sector to make a full spacecraft. So far, private companies like Larsen & Toubro or Godrej Aerospace have only manufactured the components that go into the making of a satellite.

**Time To Go Public**

India has two stock exchanges that really matter - the NSE and the BSE. So if those two companies wish to go public and list on the stock market, they’ve got two options to begin with. One, list shares on the rival stock exchange and risk being regulated by a competitor. Or two, list shares on it’s own stock exchange which is prohibited by regulations due to being the most obvious conflict of interest since the makers of sliced bread said it was the best thing ever. While the BSE is already in the process of listing shares and going public, the NSE [entered](http://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/nse-plans-to-file-ipo-document-by-jan-2017/article8779637.ece) the fray last week by announcing plans to go public as well. Interestingly, along with plans to list shares in India, the company also intends to list overseas by April of next year. It’s a fantastic time of the year to go public. Despite the naysayers of Brexit, recent IPOs have [received](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-ipos-idUSL4N19Q22K) a lot attention from investors and the IPO pipeline currently has big names like Vodafone, ICICI Prudential and L&T Infotech.

This statistic comes in the middle of the 90-day window given by the government where it has [promised](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/sm685foUYic1odLvsTAgOI/Come-clean-by-30-September-Arun-Jaitley-to-black-money-hold.html) to not investigate anyone who declares black money, and pays a 45% tax including a penalty. But the question is - can you trust the government to honour its end of the agreement? You just know that at the very least, your name is going to end up on some “special watchlist” at the Income Tax Department.

When you buy insurance, you’re really just buying a promise. A promise that you’ll get more money in case something happens. Turns out, promises don’t exactly have a lot of shipping fees and so they can be easily sold online.

With 12,000 trains carrying 23 million passengers every day, the potential is huge. The business of delivering food is where a delay of mere minutes can turn your customer from just hungry to hungry and annoyed. And if there is one thing that the Indian Railways is known for, it is for never having any delays at all.

I, for one, genuinely want to know if this is true. And if yes, how? Let's try to keep our political biases aside, it concerns our country and our lives. 

Regarding the Supreme Court, the OP refers to [the SC thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7c0mjv/an_institution_collapses_update_on_what_is/).

> Why does it matter?

> It implies that the Chief Justice can effectively stop any allegations of corruption against itself by refusing to let anyone else hear the matter. This is very significant for corruption, and also in light of the fact that **the current government is trying hard through the NJAC to take control of who becomes a Supreme Court judge.**

Last I checked, this happened - [SC Bench strikes down NJAC Act as ‘unconstitutional and void’](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-verdict-on-njac-and-collegium-system/article7769266.ece) and there haven't been any developments since. There have been secular and apolitical cases for NJAC before by reputed scholars in publications like thehindu, Indian Express etc.

> RBI after demonetisation

>> For argument’s sake, even if we accept that the demonetisation was not in the best interest of the Indian economy, could Patel have prevented this? Section 26(2) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, says that on recommendation of RBI’s central board, the government may, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that with effect from a date specified in the notification, any series of banknotes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender. And, Section 7 of the Act says, “The central government may from time to time give such directions to the Bank as it may, after consultation with the Governor of the Bank, consider necessary in the public interest.” So, the government’s advice to RBI on demonetisation is in accordance with the Act, which also permits the government to supersede the central bank if it believes RBI has failed to carry out its obligations.

It has always been this way, we had a media friendly governor but RBI has only had a semblance of independence and the govt has not tried to force any rate cuts, which still speaks volumes. The governor is still allowed to criticize policies (like waivers) and is doing his job on NPAs. I strictly urge people not to let out their disappointment of Rajan not getting a second term on the institution and current governor.

https://www.newslaundry.com/2015/11/30/the-reliance-effect-when-is-corporate-ownership-of-media-especially-dangerous

I think this is a genuine concern and the developments off late haven't been desirable, this really should be discussed more and the media will never discuss it. Media being generally politically owned/biased. 

>  The Finance bill which give political parties access to benaami funding.

I do not really know much about this so I'd rather not opine and let someone with more knowledge of the bill rather than cursory read of articles explain in detail how it makes things worse than they are.

> He is making the 0.001% at the top above law, almost god-like. This includes the business tycoons, senior most officials in the government, Ministers

This reads more like political statement without any subtantiation, and the response to it will be more based on personal perception of whoever is discussing. And as psychology tells us, our genuine perception can be the way we want it to be, based on our biases. Our minds work to confirm our worldview, not refute it.

What I know is that this country has always had that culture, in fact, most collectivist cultures do. Indian economy has always had heavy influence of the incumbent traditional business-houses. The public policy has always worked in a way to retain the incumbents rather than provide competition.

> senior most officials in the government, Ministers

And I suppose this is referring to the ordinance proposed by the Raje govt in Rajasthan? The senior BJP leadership stated they don't support it and afaik, even indicated that they'd take action against Raje were she to move forward with this. There were [voices against this in BJP](https://www.oneindia.com/india/not-only-opposition-some-bjp-leaders-also-against-rajasthan-govt-s-draconian-ordinance-2567599.html) itself and they've responded to the feedback.

What motivated me to post this? I'm a regular citizen who goes about his life in a distinctively apolitical fashion. I've enjoyed countless discussions here on this forum but I've sort of become apathetic, and I don't see the doom out in real life.

What are my genuine gripes with the Modi government? The big-brother like approach and linking everything to Aadhaar in the name of ""anti-black money"" movement, creating a surveillance state. The ""Project Insight"" (cue Avengers reference) of stalking people by the taxman, will it really be only for tax purposes? I doubt it. 

I acknowledge there are genuine concerns about the policies adopted by the current government and I want to know more about them, have a constructive discussion. I'd be more than happy to be proven wrong with proper sources and arguments. Afterall, it's impossible for a person to know every aspect of everything. ",6

**Food (Wastage, Inflation)**

Shin Chan used to separate out *shimla mirch* from his meals and throw them in the trash because he didn’t like them. And also because he didn’t understand the economics of food wastage and inflation in modern India. A review by Economic Times last week [reported](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/food-wastage-can-cost-a-family-rs-80-lakh/articleshow/53127874.cms) that if the average family reduces food wastage by half and invested the savings at 10% returns, it can add up to ₹21 lakh in 30 years. However, that is not a static number since food prices tend to rise with inflation. And the inflation numbers for June [back](http://www.firstpost.com/business/cpi-inflation-at-5-77-should-ring-alarm-bells-for-new-rbi-governor-2890602.html) that claim. Food inflation was at 7.79% in June, up from 7.47% in May. Specifically, inflation in vegetables was about 14% in June, up from about 10% in May. So the next time your mother tells you to eat your vegetables, just pinch your nose and eat those godforsaken things that masquerade around as food. While that number only looks at food prices, consumer inflation which looks at prices in general stayed pretty much the same at 5.77%. Far from being a reason to pop open the champagne, “pretty much the same” still means a 22-month high. That 5.77% number should ring alarm bells for the RBI because if it crosses 6%, the RBI is required to explain to the government why it failed at keeping inflation in check. 

  

**The Business Of Cricket**

Baba Karl Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. But in India, you could easily replace religion with cricket in that sentence and it would still stand true. With cows being the only thing more sacred that cricket in India, all that religious obsession over cricket has made gods out of cricketers. And cricketers have raked in the money as they’ve turned themselves into a brand. Just a short list of businesses that Virat Kohli owns partly or entirely includes a chain of fitness centers, a clothing line, a tennis team, a football team, a wrestling team and a sport-based social network. And he’s adding one more to that list. Mr. Kohli is now a co-owner of his own [fanclub](http://yourstory.com/2016/05/virat-kohli-fanbox-privyplex/) called ‘Virat FanBox’ that sells a branded edition of Moto G smartphone that comes preloaded with his app that gives users exclusive access to him. With a price tag of ₹16,999, Virat FanBox also gets you a signed miniature cricket bat and one-year subscription to his fanclub. And of course, it has to come in a box, otherwise the name wouldn’t make sense. Time for a confession - that was news in May, not last week. Last Week In Indian Economy, bringing you week-old, and sometimes even months-old stale and smelly news since 2016. More recently though, last week Dhoni’s apparel and footwear brand Seven [marked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/dhonis-brand-seven-grosses-over-2-5-million-in-three-months/articleshow/53221126.cms) a milestone of $2.5 million in sales just three months after launching. 

  

**Gotta Catch ‘Em All!**

It started with Angry Birds. Then came Flappy Bird. And now we don’t exactly have another bird, but we have Pokemon Go. The augmented reality mobile gaming app has instantly catapulted to so much popularity that it is now bigger than Tinder and Twitter. The internet managed to give it the hug of death as well. With more than 15 million (official) [downloads](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pokemon-nintendo-business-implications-augmented-000000901.html) from 26 countries, the mobile game had to stop new players from signing up because the traffic had pushed its servers over the edge. Perhaps more noteworthy is the fact that it has managed to do the impossible. It’s managed to bring out hordes of nerds from underground basements to open-air gardens and parks, many of whom are just finding out that they are allergic to sunlight. It’s also managed to bring the stock of Nintendo up by 106% in the past two weeks. Nintendo owns 32% of The Pokemon Company, which is reportedly [making](http://www.wsj.com/articles/pokemon-chasing-investors-send-nintendo-shares-soaring-1468228206) an estimated $1.6 million per day in revenues from the game. For Nintendo, this couldn’t have come at a better time - the company’s profits fell by 61% last year due to weak sales of its console Wii U.

  

**Let The Games Begin! Again.**

The earnings season is here again. Which means newspapers don’t have to worry about filling empty space anymore. This earnings season was kicked off by three high profile names - Infosys, TCS and Reliance. As oil prices recover in the global market, petrochemical major Reliance [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/ril-q1-beats-estimates-profit4-grm-surges-to-361150bbl_7047161.html) a 4.4% increase in net profits beating expectations. The company’s currently busy preparing for a commercial launch of Reliance Jio, it’s foray into the telecom business. Moving over to names in the IT industry that reported earnings - When Donald Trump rants about foreigners stealing American jobs, this is part of what he’s unknowingly referring to. Both IT companies, TCS and Infosys are in the business of helping multinational corporations outsource their work and business is booming. But only for one of them. TCS [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tcs-q1-results-idINKCN0ZU15T) a better-than-expected 11% rise in net profit but dalal street had no love for the stock which remained flat. Perhaps due to fears over Brexit since the UK contributes 15% to the company’s revenue while the rest of Europe adds another 12%. On the other hand, while Infosys did post a 13% rise in profits, but it [lowered](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/infosys-posts-lacklustre-q1-result-slashes-outlook-2917009/) its predictions of the profit it might report throughout the rest of the year. Definitely no love for the stock which is down over 8%.

* Former RBI Governor D. Subbarao’s memoir called “Who moved my interest rate?” hit the stands last week. In the tell-all book that may cause some embarrassment to prominent leaders in the government, Subbarao [gives](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/d-subbaraos-memoirs-manmohan-singh-ignored-finance-minister-on-subbarao-term/article8850380.ece) all the dirty details of his stressful relationships with then finance ministers P. Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee. Since this book comes 3 years after his term as Governor ended, all we have to do now is wait 3 years for Raghuram Rajan (or “R3” as the social media calls him) to write a book revealing the real reason behind his resignation. Mark your calendars for 2019. 
  

* Recent research reports [indicate](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/earn/which-it-jobs-will-survive-automation-find-out/articleshow/53127553.cms) that Indian IT and Services industry is scheduled to lose about 6.4 lakh low-skilled jobs to automation over the next five years. Ugh, not another robots are taking over our jobs story. Although all the jobs at risk are at the bottom of the pyramid, this is alarming since the $160 billion IT industry is one of India’s biggest employers. We already have an R3, won’t be long before we get an R2-D2 as well. 
  

* Air India is certainly not a private sector airliner. But a lot of bureaucrats treat Air India like their own private airliner. Part of that is because they’re mandated by law to travel by Air India. That might be changing soon. In a potential policy change, bureaucrats may be [allowed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-may-lose-privilege-of-being-sole-carrier-of-government-staff-if-cabinet-note-goes-through/articleshow/53144940.cms) to choose the airline that offers the lowest fare rather than having to travel on Air India. So, Air India may lose the privilege of being sole carrier of government babus. Although, was it really a privilege before this? 
  
* You know how the bad guys in every movie always carry black suitcases full of cash to a drug deal? How much cash do you reckon is inside those suitcases? Well, if the government gets to decide, no more than ₹3 lakh. The government is considering a ban on cash [transactions](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ban-cash-transactions-of-above-rs-3-lakh-to-curb-black-money-top-court-told-1431507) of more than ₹3 lakh. Another measure under consideration seeks to ban holding more than ₹15 lakh in cash at any time.

[RANT] Reality v/s Perception about the state of affairs in Bengal (economically).,15,3rvcoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3rvcoi/rant_reality_vs_perception_about_the_state_of/,73,1446914505.0,"The trend right now is to continuously harp on certain shortcomings and create an environment of negativity about Bengal. And it's shocking how the ones who leave Bengal are busy bad-mouthing the state the most. That actually causes a very negative perception about it.

Contrary to the prevalent perception, the Bengal govt has done a significant amount of work in the last 4 years. Lets talk about them first.

->Growth:

i) Gross Value Added- India is growing at 7.5 percent while West Bengal is growing at 10.48 percent 

ii) Agriculture- India is growing at 1.1 percent, West Bengal is growing at 6.46 percent 

iii) Industries - India 5.6 percent, West Bengal 8.34 percent 

iv) Services- India 10.9 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent

v) Per Capita Income - India 6.1 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent.

These are as per statistics of the Central Statistical Organisation.

-> Investment Proposals:

i) Since TMC came to office, Rs 84,923 crore of investments are either completed or in process.

ii) In the Bengal Global Business Summit, Rs 2,43,000 crore of investment proposals are tabled and work has already started on the Rs 91000 crore within the last five months. 

iii) Changi airport has come to West Bengal creating the first ever with BAPL private sector greenfield airport in India, nobody talks about that. What is interesting is 1800 acres around the airport - 56 percent of which will have to be non-polluting industry is going to come up there, transforming that entire area as an Aerotropolis. 

iv) SAIL is already implementing on a promised Rs 16000 crore investment in the state and has now promised another Rs 40000 crore of investment. 

v) Anil Ambani's group is investing in cement. 

vi) Tata Metaliks has asked for expansion of its plant. 

vii) NTPC is coming up with two more power plants,work has already started on those. 

viii) TCS is almost ready with a new campus bringing in 20000 new jobs. Cognizant and Wipro have announced 5000 and 2400 new jobs respectively. 

ix) Wipro has started work on the construction of a new campus already. 

x) The largest Software Technology Park of India (STPI) is coming up in Kolkata for a Rs 100 crore investment. 

xi) Caparro Group has committed to investing in a small car manufacturing hub in Bengal,land has already been bought.

xii) Bengal Birbhum Coalfields, the newly formed company in which Bengal has the largest share, could well be a game changer for the industry-starved state.The company will develop Deocha Pachami, the country's largest mineable coal block, which happens to be in West Bengal's Birbhum district. 

xiii)Chinese bus manufacturing company Zhongtong has decided to set up an assembling unit at the airport city in Burdwan's Andal. The company has proposed to invest Rs 250 crore in the first phase and scale it up to Rs 1,500 crore. Zhongtong plans to manufacture buses in Andal later. 

xiv) Mahindra & Mahindra is investing 150 crores in Kharagpur.

->Finance Hub

Setting up a greenfield Finance Hub is a real tough thing. BKC took 3 decades to get built. Bangalore tried this. It failed. GIFT Tried this. In spite of ""Brand Gujarat"" and PR skills of Modi, it has failed to attract as many investors as New Town Finance Hub attracted. Getting 19 national level Financial Institutions commit investment by buying land at 13 crore / acre in a time span of 4 years is just AMAZING boss..
Is the Media ever coming up with these news? Even if they are coming up, they are portraying these things in negative light telling how many plots are yet to be sold.

->Tourism:

i) We know what traffic Darjeeling was receiving before TMC came. If you want check the pre-2011 statistics of Bagdogra Airport. Annual traffic was around 2-3 Lakhs. Last year (2015 March) it reached the mark of 1 million air passengers / year. in 2011, Bimal Gurung and his gang was creating trouble almost every other day through Bandhs and stuffs like that. Do we hear of those things now? That was MB's diplomacy and political shrewdness .

ii) Jangalmahal: It was a Naxalite den. Today we have several tourism initiatives happening there , tourists are visiting those places in good numbers. Bengalis love to roam around. They are getting new places to visit in WB itself. Tourism industry ( hotels and cottages) does not require much land and generates a lot of blue-collar employment in the form of drivers, stewards, cooks, guides,etc.

That's what a good administration was supposed to deliver.

->Financial Improvement

i) In 2010-11 (March 2011), debt-GDP ratio was 40%. In March 2015, it was 33%. 

ii) WB Govt own tax Revenue in March 2011: 21,000 crore WB Govt own tax Revenue in March 2015: 41,000 crore 

iii) Capital investment in state budget ( investment in creation of physical assets i.e. Roads, Bridges, irrigation canals,etc) increased by more than 500% in 4 years.

Does media ever report these incidents?

iv)Revenue Doubling happened at a time when oil prices crashed and state govt's tax collection on petrol and diesel got severely impacted.

Don't you think these show better administrative skills?

->Kanyashree Programme and Fair Price Medicine Shops

Similar models are getting implemented across many states at all-India level now. We know the good points of these schemes.This is a unique example where United Nations is now saying 53 developing countries who met in London must adopt the Kanyashree program.

->Revival of State PSUs

i)Only three states have discoms that are profitable (without subsidies) - West Bengal, Goa and Maharastra - according to the Planning Commission. 

ii) Transport PSUs were sucking up hundreds of crores of subsidy every year. Daily earnings of CSTC in 2011: 20 lakhs Daily earnings of CSTC in 2015: 30 lakhs

Now almost all the transport PSUs are profitable.

iii) Loss making Tantuja and Manjusha is profitable now. So is the newly launched Biswa Bangla Brand. It's not just about profit of these PSUs. More Profitable these companies are, more weavers, craftsmen, handloom workers can benefit from these platforms by getting more orders and earning more money. More direct as well as indirect employment is generated. Also , these profits form ""non-tax revenue"" of state budget, which helps in more capital investment.

Again, is the Media ever highlighting these things?

->FAILURES

The major failure has been in generating white collar jobs ( Both in IT and Manufacturing). And this happened because they did not market ""Brand Bengal"" well. Not giving SEZ Permission was perhaps the most stupid decision ever.

But Media is continuously highlighting these stuffs only. In 5 years, there has been only 2 Foreign Trips by MB and Media is complaining. On the Contrary, MB and her bureaucrats should have made several trips to Silicon Valley and should have tried to incentivize more Hi-Tech Companies to establish R&D Centres in Kolkata.

->BOTTOMLINE:

Every State has its own problems.

Do people in Bangalore always complain about broken roads? Do people in Gujarat always complain why GIFT could never become a success in almost 9 years or why Ahmedabad could never become a big IT Hub?

No....Boss....No

**Pip Pip, Guv’nah!**

It’s here, and it’s real. The referendum to decide Britain’s fate took place last week, and a lot of things have hit the fan since then. It’s time for the Brits to wake up and smell the tea. With a 52% share of the vote, the Brexit camp won, which means the UK will now [leave](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/17/11963668/brexit-uk-eu-explained) the EU. It won’t happen next week, or next month - they now need to go through a complex procedure that can potentially take about 2 years to complete before officially becoming EU-free. They need to negotiate the terms of the exit with the EU as well as sort out some internal affairs that had been managed by the EU until now. The EU which accounts for 1/4th of global economy is also India’s single largest export market. To ELI5 the effect this will have on India - previously, Indian companies had to satisfy only one rule in order to sell products everywhere in Europe. But now, they will have to satisfy one rule in order to sell products in the UK, and another rule in order to sell products everywhere else in Europe. Nevertheless, the headline news here is that most of UK just went, “Farewell, European Union!”. Or more accurately, as the Brits would say, “Cheerio, buggers!”. 



**You Get To Exit, And You Get To Exit, Everybody Gets to Exit**

There are exits and then there are exits. But it all started with the Rexit (Rajan exiting the RBI). Now coincidentally, we’ve got an exodus of people in business and economics leaving their positions. YC Deveshwar, who’s been for 20 years the head of ITC, the billion dollar cigarettes-to-hotels firm is [leaving](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/uhmto3w6LYTfdGcXfcdjLN/Deveshwar-to-lead-ITC-as-nonexecutive-chairman-after-term-e.html) next year. SK Roy, the head of LIC, the state-run insurance company that is the single biggest domestic investor in the markets today just [tendered](http://www.firstpost.com/business/lic-chairman-s-k-roy-another-upa-appointee-resigns-before-his-5-year-term-2851360.html) his resignation as well. Roy was appointed for a 5-year term under the Manmohan Singh government. His term still has 2 years remaining but he’s calling it quits now. Can you guess the name of someone else who was also appointed under the Singh government and who also recently surprised everyone by the news of his exit? Alright, alright.. I’m sorry, I’ll move on. And now for some international resignations. Nikesh Arora, celebrity investor and ex-Google exec who was being groomed to be the next CEO of SoftBank also [resigned](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-can-t-be-ceo-in-waiting-softbank-s-nikesh-arora-explains-sudden-resignation-2226223) after they told him that founder and current CEO, Masayoshi wanted to be CEO for 5-10 more years. Kids these days, I tell you, so impatient. 48-year-old Nikesh Arora is currently busy coming to terms with the fact that he just left behind a pay package of $73 million a year.

**A ménage à trois**

A merger is when two or more companies come together to become one. Usually, mergers that are in the news refer to just two companies coming together. The *or more* part is rarely invoked. But this time, we have a rare case of merger with HDFC Life, Max Life Insurance and Max Financial Services [going](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/MJ5YsT8RS330FJhTDYJJZM/Boards-of-HDFC-Standard-Life-Max-Financial-to-meet-to-discu.html) for a threesome of mergers. Here’s how it’ll work: Max Life Insurance, the fourth-largest private insurer, will merge with parent company, Max Financial Services which will then merge with HDFC Life, the third-largest private insurer. Together, they will combine to become India’s largest private insurer. Every merger has a story behind it, albeit not always an exciting one, it’s still business and not Dan Brown. But our story begins 13.8 billion years ago with the big bang. We had some dinosaurs. Then some other stuff happened. And then in the late 1990s, India allowed private insurance companies to compete in the market which was dominated by the state-run Life Insurance Corporation. It should’ve spelled bad news for LIC but it still emerged as the winner in the competition as even today, the insurance industry is dominated by LIC. It’s no joke to compete against LIC which sells insurance policies that are basically guaranteed by the government. So you need to join forces and make allies if you want to take on the ring-leader that is LIC. And this three-way merger is only an effort to join forces and make allies.

**Funding For A Fund Of Funds That Funds Startups**

A significant part of this series always ends up being about the government even though it is supposed to be about the economy. Well, that’s because a significant part of our economy is controlled by the government through state-owned corporations and legislative policies. But the government’s influence on the economy is gradually declining because of policies like disinvestment, where the government gradually privatizes state-owned corporations. But sometimes, you just have to invest to spur growth. The government [approved](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/establishment-of-fund-of-funds-for-funding-support-to-start-ups-116062200723_1.html) a ₹10,000 crore fund that will be managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India, who will use the money to invest in funds that invest in startups. With this, the government isn’t trying to encourage the creation of Indian Zuckerbergs and Gates’ - it’s trying to encourage the creation of Indian jobs (with the lowercase j). More specifically, the fund is expected to create 18 lakh jobs. 18 lakh jobs? That’s enough to feed 18 lakh poor families. Either that, or about 18 #Urbanpoors.

* From purchasing an eraser to issuing a press release, the government’s bureaucracy machine is known for setting up panels and committees and sub-committees and commissions to oversee everything. But not for finding a replacement for Raghuram Rajan. Jesus Christ, are we still on him? Yes, we’re still on him. The Prime and Finance Ministers are expected to [handpick](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/pm-narendra-modi-and-fm-arun-jaitley-to-select-raghuram-rajans-successor-not-a-panel/articleshow/52842311.cms) the next governor of RBI, and the news has it that they’re looking for a person with a background in economics rather than policy.

* Get ready to feel gross in your wet sandals and tip toe your way to the bathroom as soon as you get home... the monsoon is [here](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/monsoon-finally-arrives-in-drought-hit-maharashtra-90-of-state-receiving-rains-met-dept/). After being late by a week, the rains have covered more than half of the country as regions previously hit by droughts have begun getting rainfall. For farmers, this means the need to plant summer crops and for investors, this means that at least we have something to counter Brexit’s effects.

* The Food Corporation of India is the government-owned company that runs and manages the public distribution system, or what you might know as the ration shops that sell food at cheap prices. It’s the FCI that pays the extra 10 bucks while buying, so that the farmer doesn’t get exploited by having to sell for cheap. Except instead of mangoes, it’s food-grains. The government provides a lot of subsidies through the corporation - so many subsidies that the FCI now owes ₹58,650 crore to others as pending subsidy payments. Which is why it is [inviting](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/fci-to-raise-rs-20000-crore-short-term-loan/articleshow/52885209.cms) bids from banks to raise a short term loan of ₹20,000 crore. Oh yeah, because when you’re a government-owned corporation, you don’t go to the banks when you need a loan. The banks come to you.

* After a political campaign that ended with the exit of the RBI Governor, MP Subramanian Swamy is the talk of the town. And now, he has [trained](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/subramanian-swamy-now-targets-cea-arvind-subramanian-after-raghuram-rajan-exit-2868336/) his guns on Chief Economic Advisor to the government, Arvind Subramanian. In a salvo of tweets, Swamy stated that Arvind should be fired immediately. For there can only be one Subramanium.

And the award for this week’s most bizarre economic story goes to: LG Electronics India, who is [rolling](http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/lg-electronics-sells-mosquito-repelling-tv-india-n594251) out TVs that come with mosquito repellent technology. The TV, which also keeps mosquitoes away when switched off, costs ₹26,500 and keeps mosquitoes that can cause diseases like malaria, zika, dengue away. Or if you think cure is better than prevention, just buy dengue insurance. Yeah, they sell those too. [Really](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/your-money/tomorrowmakersshow/48985928.cms).

US technology is no longer just about smartphones and facebook apps, it’s also about sex-sorted bovine semen.

This comes as part of a project that aims to increase milk production and make it more profitable for the farmers of India. Feminism may not be working out for the women of India, but it’s really taking off for the cows of India.

< For the Week Ending [18th June, 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4p32ns/last_week_in_indian_economy_for_the_week_ending/)",6
WTF is Demonetisation - Part II,13,5fpo2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5fpo2v/wtf_is_demonetisation_part_ii/,11,1480542366.0,"What is Participatory Note?
Participatory notes are not mere instruments used by Pakistan to invest in our economy. Modi says he goes to a lot of foreign countries  to bring in Foreign Investment.

Out of such Foreign Investments, the highest a country has invested is not US or the UK or France or Germany or any other major country but a tiny island called Mauritius. 

A small Island off Indian Ocean whose total population would be about 12 L! Mauritius has invested more than 40% in India. 

Many other such islands like Cayman islands etc exist. How did such islands get such huge money to invest in India and who exactly are those people? Whose money is it anyways? 

That money is none other than the illegal stash of the Indian crony capitalists! The money starts from India and goes on a sight seeing trip across many countries and finally gets to Mauritius - which then finds its way back to India as Foreign Investment!

If the illegal money that is in circulation in India is Jeevatma, the illegal money circulating around the globe is Paramatma - in the language the BJP folk can understand!

Jeevatma becomes one with the Paramatma, this indian sewer water gets mixed with International sewer waters, then when it comes back to India again via Mauritius, it is the Pure Virgin Ganges water or Foreign Investment - Modi will do snanam and worship it and welcome it with folded hands!

The very same black money that they say they are trying to eradicate, has come back as Foreign Investment, and it gets lots of subsidies when it comes back to India!

So who's taking it away to Foreign countries? How do they take it?Let's for a moment forget TATA, Birla, Ambani, Adani etc, among the fat cats there are individual fat cats like our ministers - yes Ministers! Many of these Ministers who do not even have a  standard education have property in foreign countries, coal, iron ore factories abroad and even whole islands in their names! Some of it has come out in the newspapers too!

People like Adani sell solar electricity to states and these ministers make a huge cut out of it. But do they get bribes in a sack and then carry it abroad? No, they just show a benami name and a property will be bought in that name or money transferred in his HSBC bank! So next this minister or that benami comes back as Foreign Investor!

Many of our ministers go on trips to such islands like Cayman Islands - does Modi not know of this? Will Modi ask all of his ministers to submit their travel itinerary for the period they have been in power for audit? 

Let's take an example: The Central Board of Excise and Customs, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence has given a report - 'a scam involving companies inflating the value of coal imports from Indonesia for their power plants thus siphoning money abroad. Initial estimates by the agency pegged the overvaluation at Rs 29,000 crore in the period 2011-2014.'

How did this scam happen? If we had purchased directly from Indonesia, a tonne of coal cost $50. However, it was handed over to other brokers and middlemen aka crony capitalists to purchase it. Coal is still in Indonesia - but it changes hands to 7-8 different countries on paper alone! So when it comes back to India it costs $87! 

So multiply 37 * 70 for a tonne. It involves states Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Kerala! Each state has lost about 1500 Cr due to this scam.

The culprits include state parties and its minister in this along with Adani, Ambani, Ruia, Jindal, India cements etc. Adani has gained 6000 Cr illegally by supplying industrial parts for Gujarat State Electricity Ltd according to Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.

Modi travelled all over India during his election campaign using Adani's Jet. Its behind Adani's money that  Modi was able to fund his political campaign!

He travelled with same Adani to Australia to get him permission for mining rights. Just this Nov 18, Adani was given 6000 cr loan for the same Australia mining project!

Can Directorate of Revenue Intelligence ask why coal sold at $50 was sold at $87 - even if they ask they'll say it is business practice - Standard Operating Procedure! Its perfectly legal and cannot be questioned in court too!

All those companies that changed hands in the process just exist in letter pads! Benami Companies! So DRI cannot do anything about this illegal money and all these companies have understanding with the countries where they are stored - so they wont ask and even if they ask it will fizzle out!

So when the govt itself is supporting this washing of Black Money to White through such routes, where does the question of catching the Black Money arise?

Atleast here coal was bought and 29000 cr lost, but there are examples where such operations have taken place in paper alone!

There is another such Island Bahamas whose population is 3.5L only. In 2008, export from India is $ 22,00,000. In 2010 it grew to $ 280,00,000. What do you think that this 3.5 Lakh people bought from India? What was being exported from India? Two companies have done it - Reliance & Essar - petroleum has been exported. Even if the 3.5 Lakh people drive around 24*7 and eat drink and shit petrol, they can't possibly use such a huge amount of petrol as was being exported! So there you go!

This was not just carried out by Ambani's but by Reddy brothers - who swallowed the Bellari, who were powerful to move the state border of karnataka into Andhra! Such efficient people - Sushma Swaraj's disciples! They have exported very high quality iron ore - how much? From the ports the reports says 5000 shiploads have been exported. But Excise has reports only 4000 shiploads. What happened to the remaining 1000 shiploads? Where is the revenue from it? Where has it been invested?

Doesn't Modi know all this?

So Black Money is not something in a hidden box which you can go and collect it and bring it back and deposit Rs. 15,00,000 in everyone's account.  Its about handling black money practices - as we've seen above they've devised ways to make such black money laudering routes and practices as legal. This incidentally has happened more during BJP rule. No its not a biased statement.

According to World Bank report during the period 1998 - 2004, it was during the vajpayee rule that such black money practices and black money has flourished to the maximum extent in India. Now you can understand why the news came in today about BJP leading the parties in income from unknown sources. 

In 2011, after scams such as 2G etc started surfacing, Advani started a Rath Yathra against Corruption and Black Money, saying there are 70 Lakh Crores of Black Money stashed abroad, I'll bring it back"". Advani was held up as the iron Man - Lauh Purush - as if he'll act like a superman bomb all illegal stashes abroad and bring all black money back but he was bombed by Modi in 2014 who took over his role and got involved with Anna Hazare etc and personally making gullible statements to fool people about 15 L for each account.

However, during UPA rule, in a very important case for Black money, the tax evasion case by Vodafone, the SC ruled that we cannot demand such tax from them. After that, when Pranab Mukherjee brought in rules to avoid such malpractices namely, GAAR - General Anti Avoidance Rules, the person who spoke vociferously against it and did not allow it was none other than our present FM Arun Jaitlee! Not just FM but all the corporates and crony capitalists were against bringing in this rule!

During UPA rule, the BJP asked Congress to bring out names of Swiss Bank holders in Parliament. Pranab Mukherjee ridiculed them in Parliament. Swiss Banks are not giving out names, shall we send the Army? BJP kept quiet and then turned it as if Congress is not giving out names. Today, when BJP is in power, Modi is giving the same answer to SC!

Now, BJP is not keen about money stashed abroad. So they turned their attention towards internal black money (Jeevatma, remember?) So doesn't Modi know who are the kingpins involved? Ok if you don't know who can find it out - Income Tax, Enforcement directorate, Revenue Intelligence, CBI, Finance Ministry are at his disposal! So what are those departments doing?

Either they are in the payrolls of such kingpins or you all have decided not to act on them. So this whole system is nothing but a farce!

So now Modi is trying to bring Black Money out of ordinary people - who have never seen such huge amount of money as quoted in this post - let alone black money! Modi has brought in an emergency situation and panicked the people. Just before this demonetisation, Modi met and discussed with 3 chiefs of Army Navy & Airforce. Why? Because, he feared a civil unrest and wanted to avoid it. This Army has not been sent against the kingpins of black money but if the ordinary people are put to much hardships they know it will lead to outcry and want to avoid it and have taken measures for that.

After doing all this, the BJP representatives when asked if by removing 500 & 1000 notes will BM be curbed, on talk shows they are saying ""We never said anything like that. This is a step towards curbing black money.""

So why such a drastic measure has been thrust on the common man? There's a reason for their activity. Its not about Black Money or Fake Money but totally irrelevant to it!

Here's why India shouldn't adopt the Nordic welfare model,36,2gg76m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2gg76m/heres_why_india_shouldnt_adopt_the_nordic_welfare/,105,1410808354.0,"DECONSTRUCTION OF THE NORDIC MODEL

Most problems that India face now can be attributed to consequences of Nehruvian socialism that this country has adopted for about 45 years. I am from Kerala and here the Politics cannot be separated from communism and despite being an age old relic, it still refuses to die out.

Since the reforms that was carried out in 1991 most millennial Indians have largely rejected such archaic concepts focusing more on modernity. But in this context a new concept has largely caught the fancy of most new age Indians: The Nordic model. As such in my experience I see more people supporting Nordic model over communism currently in Kerala. 

In this slightly lengthy post, I will try to deconstruct the Nordic model from two angles.

1. Nordic viability in India
2. Efficacy of Nordic model

First a note on Nordic model. Nordic model or Nordic capitalism or Nordic social democracy refers to the economic and social models of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), which involves the combination of a free market economy with a welfare state. More or less implemented around the mid 60s, this is said to have promoted a sustainable state and economy in these countries. Calls have been made among policy makers in India, with special mention to Nobel prize winning welfare economist Amartya Sen, to implement reforms along the Nordic lines in India

NORDIC VIABILITY IN INDIA

Nordic Socialism: Indian proponents of Nordic model advocate establishing a state along the social democracy lines. But the truth is that Scandinavia isn't really all that socialist. Scandinavian countries have certain socialist characteristics such as high taxes and extensive welfare systems. However, these countries have relatively capitalistic markets. Scandinavian businesses are mostly free from regulation, nationalization and protectionism. Sweden, Denmark and Finland rank higher than US in in business freedom, monetary freedom, investment freedom, fiscal freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. Norway ranks higher than the US in trade freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. 

Source: http://www.heritage.org/index/explore

The overall point here is that Scandinavian countries have fairly capitalistic business environments. Until India, which has abysmal rankings in all these parameters, achieve free business environment and comparable income levels it should not consider a comparable welfare model.

 Economic calculation problem: First proposed by Ludwig von Mises, it describes the signalling function of prices. Prices of goods are signals to entrepreneurs to adequately allocate their resources. When economic planning is added to the mix, it distorts the market forces and prices. This in turn facilitates inefficient allocation of resources and wastage. In a macro scale this presents itself as inflation. Larger the economy, harder it becomes to ""plan"". Scandinavian nations are all small economies with homogeneous economic components and it would be relatively easier to centralize function there (But it has not been without its demerits, more on that below). India is one of the largest and the most diverse economy in the world in terms of the economic components involved. As such India is last candidate for any sort of planning. History has shown that most planning here has met with some sort of counterproductive unintended consequence and the inflation numbers here speaks for itself.

Bureaucracy and social trust: Scandinavian countries are characterized by high levels of social liberalism and trust. Research finds that high levels of social trust increase economic growth. According to one study, ""The size of the effect in most studies is such that 10 percentage points higher trust is associated with half a percentage point higher annual growth rate. In the Scandinavian countries, about 60 percent agree that most people can be trusted, which can be compared to the OECD average of about just 40 percent.

There is also the case of the highly transparent nature of the bureaucracy in the Scandinavian nations. As with the trust worthy nature of the bureaucrats there, they can be trusted with governing functions of the state. Bureaucracy is India on the other hand is an absolute mess. India features almost at the bottom of the transparency index. As evidenced by the corruption, Bureaucrats here simply cannot be trusted with any action and would be best left free of bureaucratic control.

Taxation problem: Scandinavian nations are characterized by high levels of taxation on income. Although I will go into the problems of Nordic model below, it must be said that these countries grow in spite of high taxes, not because of them. Indeed, several studies which examine taxation across developed countries show that when other determinants of growth are accounted for, taxation seriously diminishes growth. At the same time it must be added that while these countries have high tax on incomes, the corporate levels are low. Corporate tax average of Scandinavian nations is about 25% compared to about 40% in USA. So it is possible that the corporate sector there is balancing the economy. Hence higher tax levels are not an option in India where industry and corporate sectors constitute only a marginal share of the overall economy.

Economic history of Nordic nations: Most Scandianavian nations instituted the Nordic model in mid 1960s. Before this most of these countries reaped benefit from high growth facilitated by laissez faire policies and neutrality in the World Wars. Welfare system that you see now wouldn't have been possible had it not been for the surplus it had made during their laissez faire era. India on the other hand has no Laissez faire history. It is a country which is home to half of the world's poor. By instituting a welfare state, India would be incentivizing these poor souls to continue in their misery.

Norway : Norway is an exception among Nordic nations itself. Oil was discovered in the North Sea in 1960 after which the country made its switch to welfare state. When liberals in US point to the per-capita GDP of Norway, they forget to mention that much of this is a result of big oil interests. Norway is the largest oil producer and exporter in all of Western Europe. Norway produces roughly 200 barrels of oil per person per year. That puts it at number 5 in the world for per capita oil production. In other words, Norway is successful despite its government, not because of its government. India is largely import dependent when it comes to oil and has very few proven oil reserves. It cannot bank on resource wealth to fund its welfare state.

EFFICACY OF THE NORDIC MODEL

In this portion, I will discuss the problems with Nordic model itself. Given below are series of comparisons he made between Scandinavian nations and USA under various parameters. While US itself is no paragon of capitalism. Over the years it has show relatively high levels of free markets which has slightly regressed in the recent years. The main difference between the American system and the Nordic Model is that America has a medium-size welfare state and the Nordic nations have large welfare states. That explains, at least in part, why the U.S. economy generally outperforms the Nordic Model. US stats were easily available online, so I took that. Give me a beak.

As seen in Figure below US has enjoyed a faster rate of growth.According to the OECD, the U.S. grew by an average of 3 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 3.3 percent between 1992 and 2006 (meaning average growth of 3.2 percent for 1981 to 2006). The Nordic nations, by contrast, grew by an average of 2.2 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 2.7 percent from 1992 to 2006(meaning average growth of 2.5 percent over the entire period). The IMF, meanwhile, reports that U.S. growth averaged 3.1 percent from 1981–2006 compared to an average of 2.6 percent for Nordic nations in the same period.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gpTtjiA.png

Figure below, measures of per capita GDP from the World Bank, the OECD, the IMF, and the CIA all show that Americans haveabout $6,000 of additional economic output per person, significantly more than $20,000 for each family of four.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/ilG5UVr.png

Although per capita GDP is an excellent measure of overall economic output relative to population, it does not necessarily measure living standards. Comparing U.S. and Nordic living standards requires numbers for disposable income. The OECD series for disposable income in the Figure below. According to a study using 2003 data, the average person in the US had more than $27,000 of disposable income, while the average person in Nordic nations Had disposable income of barely $14,300, less than 53 percentof the U.S. level. Even Norwegians, bolstered by oil wealth, had per capita disposable income of less than $16,800, barely 62 percent of the American level. Danes and Finns are at the bottom, with less than 50 percent of the disposable income of the average American. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/anuxd8j.png

Personal consumption: In 2005, the Danish Finance Ministry produced numbers comparing per capita private consumption in OECD nations. As seen in Figure below, the average person in Nordic nations has barely 51 percent as much private consumption as an average American. The Norwegians are the most prosperous, but even their private consumption is just 56 percent of U.S. levels. Both the Swedes and the Finns have less than 50 percent of the private consumption of average Americans. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/jIIqdoc.png

As expected by the nature of free markets Nordic countries lag US when it comes to per capita GDP growth

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gjBFuGG.png

Last but not least, defenders of the Nordic Model argue that the US suffers from greater levels of income inequality. Various measures of inequality, such as Gini coefficients, confirm that “wealthy” Americans earn a bigger share of the pie than Upperincome citizens in Nordic nations. But this data is incomplete without also looking at the size of the pie. As illustrated in Figure below, the poorest 10 percent of Americans have about the same level of income as the poorest 10 percent of Finns, Swedes, and Danes. Only in oil-rich Norway is there a noticeable gap (data for Iceland not available). What differentiates America from the Nordic nations is the income of everyone else. The rich, the middle class, and the working class in the US enjoy higher levels of income than their Nordic counterparts. If nations are being judged on the prosperity of their poorest citizens, then Nordic nations certainly are equal to the US. Indeed, they even have a slight advantage (though even that advantage might disappear if Nordic nations had US levels of immigration). But if nations are being judged on factors beyond just the well-being on the poorest segment of the population, then the US holds a clear edge.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/lDeXvnX.png

CONCLUSION

Excessive government diminishes growth. And although the Nordic countries’ relatively free markets mitigate the damage caused by high taxes and high spending, the burden of government is hindering economic performance. The Nordic Model is preferable to the Continental or Corporatist Model of nations such as France and Germany, which combines welfare state policies and interventionism. When I was researching this , Google news showed that Sweden plans to scale back it welfare state due to pressure. 

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/swedish-elections-cracks-showing-nordic-model

These AAP Kejriwal types are constantly backing a welfare state. I am not against AP or anything, if they can just fix their economic policies, I'll be all for them. Milton Friedman famously said that you cannot have a Welfare state and open borders. Sweden seems to learning that lesson. In India's case Free markets is the best option.

Since so many people called me out for making up shit I will simply quote from articles this time.


Creation of money by the banks

> The Credit Market Funnel

> Suppose the U.S. Treasury prints up $10 billion in new bills, and the Federal Reserve credits an additional $90 billion in readily liquefiable accounts. At first, it might seem like the economy just received a monetary influx of $100 billion, but that is actually only a very small percentage of the actual money creation.
> 
> This is because of the role of banks and other lending institutions that receive new money. Nearly all of that extra $100 billion enters banking reserves. Banks don't just sit on all of that money, even though the Fed now pays them 0.25% interest to just park the money with the Fed Bank. Most of it is loaned out to governments, businesses and private individuals.
> 
> The credit markets have become a funnel for money distribution. **However, in a fractional reserve banking system, new loans actually create even more new money. With a legally required reserve ratio of 10%, the new $100 billion in bank reserves could potentially result in a nominal monetary increase of $1 trillion.**

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081415/understanding-how-federal-reserve-creates-money.asp

India uses the same system overall but the multiplier is higher.


> Every one rupee of central bank money in India is able to generate around 6 rupees of money supply in the economy. India’s ratio remains lower than that of Europe, but higher than that of the US.

**NPAs in India**

> Public sector banks (PSBs), which accounted for 90 percent of the total gross NPAs of the banking sector, has seen their gross NPAs jumping past Rs 7 lakh crore in June 2017 quarter. In the past seven quarters, it jumped by Rs 4.18 lakh crore or 133 percent to Rs 7.33 lakh crore in June 2017 quarter from Rs 3.14 lakh crore in September 2015 quarter.

> Public Sector Banks' Gross Non-Performing Assets Hit 9.83%. In FY16
> Gross NPAs of private sector banks were Rs. 48,380 crore, meaning just 2.70 per cent of gross advances of Rs. 17,91,681 crore during the fiscal 2015-16.

> For example, in the steel sector, Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel have an exposure of close to Rs 1 lakh crore. Other large stressed companies - Jaypee, Lanco, Videocon, and GMR jointly owe over Rs 3 lakh crore to the banking system. Most of them got into non-core activities like real estate which guzzled up the borrowings, resulting in losses and defaults to banks.

Punjab National Bank was second with wilful defaults of Rs 10,989 crore in 871 accounts. Bank of Baroda’s wilful defaults soared from Rs 1,367 crore in the year ended March 2016 to Rs 4,785 crore by March 2017.

> Recently, finance minister Arun Jaitley candidly admitted that the bad loan problem was largely confined to some 50 large corporate groups who had indiscriminately borrowed from banks to set up steel and infrastructure projects, especially in the power sector. **These groups alone would account for over 80% of the total NPAs and stressed assets in the banking system.** Latest data shows that the total NPAs and stressed assets are in the range of Rs 13 lakh crore to Rs 14 lakh crore. **And these are politically, well connected corporate families who dominate election funding.**

Somewhat of an opinion piece but read out of it what you want.


Based on all the quotes above I want to ask a few questions, why did the government still decide to recapitalize using public money? Why isn't divestment of SBI and PSU banks on the table? 

Doesn't pumping more public money mean doing the same mistake all over again? All the NPAs were given to political friends of Congress around 2009 or so. 

Now without substantial changes big loans will be given to political friends of BJP and it is very likely that the loans will become NPAs some 10 years or so from now.",6
Last Week in Parliament (July 18 to July 22),51,4uhxod,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4uhxod/last_week_in_parliament_july_18_to_july_22/,8,1469471597.0,"Hello /r/India,

I return with another four weeks of fun and frolic at the expense of our elected leaders in Parliament!

Last week, a shiny new cabinet was sworn in, a spirited discussion on Kashmir crisis (and TN Fishermen and Bangladeshi infiltrators) happened, an unknown rule was invoked unknowingly and shot down promptly and many legislations were passed.
Let’s get right into it!

#Shiny new Cabinet sworn in
___

Apart from the [53 new members](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/partymemberlist.aspx) that were sworn into Rajya Sabha, PM Modi introduced his new ministers to both houses. Prakash Javadekar replaced Smriti Irani as Minister of Human Resource Development, Vijay Goyal was given Ministry of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs & Sports and Anil Madhav Dave was sworn in as the new Minister of State (Independent charge) of Environment forest and Climate Change. A whole host of new Ministers of State were also sworn in. 

I know what you’re thinking.
 
*What’s the difference between a Cabinet Minister, Minister of State (Independent Charge) and Minister of State?* 

**Cabinet Minister**: Person is given full control over a Ministry and is eligible to attend cabinet meetings (which is the highest decision-making body of the country).

**Minister of State (Independent Charge)**: Person is given charge over a ministry, but the PMO keeps a close watch on how the ministry is functioning. These ministers are allowed to attend cabinet meetings only if the PM’s permits them to do so.

**Minister of State**: Person is given charge of a specific department or just a part of a Ministry, especially when the Ministry is large (Eg: Home, Defence or Finance). The Cabinet Minister has complete authority to decide what tasks are to be given to the MoS within the Ministry. MoS cannot attend cabinet meetings.

Casual Observation: Out of all those who were sworn in, Arjun Ram Meghwal seemed to have gotten the loudest thumps and cheers. He used to be the Chief Whip of BJP in Lok Sabha and has now been made MoS of Finance. 
Seems like he won’t be able to [bicycle to Parliament anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxyz8YASYHk).

Bonus: Here’s the [mother of all government directories](http://goidirectory.nic.in/union_categories.php?ct=E002), in case you want to find out how to reach ministries. This includes state ministries and PSUs as well. Explore away!

#Kashmir Crisis… Bangladeshi Infiltration and Tamil Fishermen
___
Discussions were held in both houses of Parliament regarding the ongoing agitation happening in the Kashmir Valley. While accusations flew thick between the Congress and BJP, regional parties like AIADMK and TMC decided to bring in their own international border issues into the discussion.

Kalyan Banerjee from TMC started speaking about infiltration from Bangladesh to West Bengal when he was interrupted by Ananth Kumar, Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers. He pointed out the Mr Banerjee was going off topic. 

[Then this happened](http://imgur.com/lWsluww)

You're killin it Khargeji!

AIADMK’s A Anwar Raajhaa (With the kind blessings of [Puruchithalaiva Amma](http://mythicalindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/weird_jayalalitha_fans.jpg)) spoke about Kashmir and then switched to talk about the problem of fishermen in Tamil Nadu who are being harassed by the Sri Lankan Navy. Raanjhaa demanded that this should be declared as a national issue as well.

#Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha Adjourns
___
The Parliament was summoned on July 18 for the monsoon session and the news was splattered with headlines like “Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha adjourns”. 

Everyone was like, “What?! Why do these politicians keep disrupting the house? Why don’t these people want to work?” 

Well, they do, but they couldn’t help it this time round.

The adjournment wasn’t because of disruptions, which is usually the cause, but for paying respects to a sitting member of Parliament who passed away. Mr Dalpat Singh Parasate of Shahdol constituency in Madhya Pradesh passed away on June 1 (#RIP). 

It’s a followed practice that in case of the death of a sitting member, Parliament will not transact any business on the first day of sitting as a mark of respect. In case an MP dies while the Parliament is in session, the house is adjourned for the following day. In the Budget session, Mr PA Sangma passed away and a similar adjournment followed. His son Conrad Sangma now occupies his seat of Tura (Meghalaya). 

The first order of business for this session in Lok Sabha was [his swearing in](http://imgur.com/vgFFwdH).

Interestingly enough, Rajya Sabha has decided in May 2016 to [curtail this practice](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajya-sabha-not-to-adjourn-for-day-if-sitting-member-dies-in-intersession-period/article8672837.ece) if the Member of Parliament passes in the interim period. The upper house will now only adjourn if an MP dies during sessions. Lok Sabha sticks to its ol’ ways. 

___
#Thou Shalt not read out Speeches
___

While giving his speech on the Kashmir crisis, A Anwar Raajhaa of the AIADMK happened to just read it out from a few sheets of paper. He even mixed up the sheets in the middle and went off course a few times. 

Rao Indrajit Singh, MoS of Urban Development, took strong offence and got up to object. He asked the chair to stop him because there is a rule against reading out speeches in the Parliament. Well, he goofed up a little though. The person in the chair was Deputy Speaker Dr M Thambidurai. He’s from the AIADMK.

Thambidurai seemed visibly upset that the chair was being questioned and asked Singh to sit down. Although a lot of the conversation was not put on record, witnesses of LSTV will vouch about the use of the word “he’s speaking nonsense” being thrown around rather loudly. At one point, Mr Singh seemed to have given out the impression to the Deputy Speaker that he was being partial towards his own party member. The otherwise calm and gentle Thambidurai seemed to be visibly upset. 

The funny thing is that this is actually a rule. Rule 352 of the [Procedure and Conduct of Business](http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rules.html) says: 

> “A member while speaking shall not…. (xi) read a written speech except with the previous permission of the Chair.” 

So in this case, there was no clarity whether or not the prior permission of the chair was taken. If only Mr Rao Indrajit Singh quoted the rule number, he might have been able to achieve his objective. 

Mods, pliss to tweet the correct rule to him?

___
#A few other interesting rules (for teh lulz)
___

**Rule 349**: Whilst the House is sitting, a member-

(iii) shall bow to the Chair while entering or leaving the House, and also when taking or leaving his seat 

[We’re not worthy!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/not-worthy.gif)

(iv) shall not pass between the Chair and any member who is speaking

Demonetisation and Bike Service,13,5ipl9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ipl9r/demonetisation_and_bike_service/,5,1481939163.0,"WARNING! THIS IS DRUNK RANTING. READ AT YOUR OWN PERIL.

It was a cold fucking day. I had to do something I had been putting off for quite some time -- get my bike serviced. I called up the closest service centers to ask if they accept payment by card and I learnt that the nearest service centre that accepts cards was 18 kilometres away. I had to do this nevertheless. As I had said, I had been putting this off forever and I cannot ride her without the service she needs.

So, rode her to that far off service centre and I reached by 13:00. The dude outside noted her number, made a job sheet, and handed out the customer copy to me. He told me that there's a mall nearbly in case I wanted to watch a movie, or I could just wait in the customer lounge. I decided to wait. There was a stupid Govinda movie on the TV -- he was double acting as a cop and his goofy twin. I sat through it. Boredom makes you appreciate the stupidest things. By the time the movie got over, I had checked to see if they had taken my bike in. They hadn't. I was getting impatient. I was getting hungry. I decided to look around for food. I found a place that sold Punjabi sandwiches, whatever the hell those were. I thought I'd pass. I walked further and I found a place cheap and crowded. It was *parathe zabardast parathe*. Crowded is nice. Crowded means you won't have diarrhoea the next morning. So, I walked in and I had a double egg paratha. I was filling as fuck and I paid him with the last 20 rupee note that I had on me.

I walked back to the service centre. They hadn't taken my bike in. That was disheartening. I decided to go and sit in the customer lounge. The aroma of the paratha that my nose had gotten used to made me realise how stinky this ""lounge"" was. It smelt of old unwashed clothes, dandruff, and grease. Anyway, I was sleepy and I dozed off.
I woke up an hour later. My bike hadn't been taken in. I talked to the manager. He said something about a queue. I grumbled and I went back to the customer lounge. I listened to music on my phone for an hour and it was 17:00. Two hours to close shop. A skinny dude finally takes my bike in. I was relieved.

The mechanic asked me if there are any problems. I told him what I had to say. He asked me where I was coming from. I told him.

""Bro, that's far away. Don't you know we have a service centre there?"" he asked.

""Yeah, but they don't accept payment by cards,"" I said.

""Oh, right.""

One of his colleagues walked by.

""Dude, the finance guy called,"" the colleague said. ""We have to wait for November's salary until January, or we have to accept in old notes.""

""I'm not taking old notes *bhencod*,"" he said. ""What if I fail to deposit into my bank account?""

""You've got a point. Yeah,"" said the colleague and he walked away.

""Your bike's sorted,"" the mechanic said. ""They'll clean it. You can make your payment by then.""

I proceeded towards the floor manager and I got my job card. I walked towards the billing counter.

That's when I saw it --  a helpdesk, a distraught girl behind it, and two cops in front of it.

""We hear that this place is accepting and transacting in old notes,"" the fat cop said.

""No, sir. The only old notes we have are from before 9 November 2016,"" the girl said.

""But, we got a call from here saying that your salaries are being disbursed in old notes. DON'T YOU DARE BULLSHIT ME!"" the fat cop bellowed.

The girl, evidently nervous, said, ""Sir, I don't know what you're talking about. We don't accept old notes anymore.""

""Who's phone number is this? We got the call from this number,"" he asked her showing an incoming call on his phone.

""Sir, this number is a common office contact,"" she said, ""Everybody uses it.""

""Okay, so that's how you're gonna play it. I want to see your cashier in two minutes,"" he said.

The cashier was behind his counter and I was having my billing done. I told him that I wanted to pay using my card.

""We're not accepting cards,"" the cashier said.

""Well, I don't have any cash. All I have is my cards,"" I told him.

""Give me five minutes,"" he told me. It looked like he was shitting his pants after the cop asked for the cashier. The cop was then standing beside me and staring intently into the cashier's face.

""Go on. Swipe his card,"" the cop said, ""I can wait for a couple of  minutes.""
 
The swiping machine was in the floor manager's room and the cashier took me along. After the swiping business was done, he said, ""Bro, I can't go back to my cabin and get your invoice. The cops are right there. I'll tell the floor manager to release your bike.""

""Cool, whatever,"" I said.

He talked to the floor manager about my bike. ""The cleaning isn't done yet,"" the floor manager said,""It's gonna take some time.""

I loitered around the shop floor and the customer lounge for some more time and my bike was finally clean. The cashier walked in and handed me my invoice.

""I had to get in there for other customers anyway. Thought I'd give you your invoice,"" he said.

""What happens now?"" I asked him out of curiosity.

""I don't know, bro. *Bhenchod*, these cops probably didn't even get a call from here. Maybe they just want a bribe. One shop a day for them I guess. That girl in reception in new. It's sad that she has to go through this,"" he said. ""Gotta go, man. They are quizzing our GM now, but I have to be there in case they need paperwork.""

""Thank you. Goodbye,"" I said.

""Goodbye,"" I said to the floor manager.

""We're used to shit like this,"" the floor manager said,"" Running a business isn't exactly easy in this shitty city. Goodbye and good night.""

And I came home on my serviced bike, under-dressed for the winter night, shivering in the cold, my hands cold as fuck, thinking of that poor receptionist and the cashier.

tl;dr Went to a service centre to get my bike serviced. Cops hassle them saying that they're transacting in old notes. They say that they're used to this kind of hassling by the cops.

p.s. I'm down quite a bit of Old Monk as I type this.

p.p.s. This shit ain't political. I just wanted to share something I've seen. I just wanted to share how big changes are a pain in the ass for businesses as well.

Or Indian School of Business and Finance Delhi where the admissions are still open. But the problem with ISBF is that they are only offering PG diploma courses (1 year courses) and the fees are expensive af (2.5k admission fee and 5.1 lakh annual fee for just one year). Also there is a lot of competition for admission and I have to give an entrance test and personal interview. My options seem to be shrinking by the minute and I don't know what to do.

Honorable Mr. Narendra Modi,

Prime Minister,

Government of India,

Raisina Hill,

New Delhi – 110011

**Subject:** To appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta, to take the right decision on various strong anti-corruption bills and to implement farmers’ issues as per the recommendations of the Swami Nathan Committee Report, I intend to hold an agitation in Delhi…


Honorable Sir,

Dreaming of a corruption-free India, there was a historic citizen agitation across the country, steered from Ramlila Maidan in 2011. Seeing the impact of this agitation, the Parliament on 27th August, 2011, had passed the resolution in the 'Sense of the House’ session. In which, the central government would frame, at the earliest, laws of appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta as well as a Citizen Charter. On the basis of this resolution, the central government had given a written assurance and with that hope, I concluded my agitation on 28th August. As a sequel to this resolution and the historic event, which enthused the citizens with hope, a good six years have passed by. However, even after six years, not a single Law pertaining to anti-corruption has been implemented. Distressed with this situation, I am writing this letter to you.

After your government came to power, for three consecutive years, I have communicated to you regarding appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta through my letters dated 28/08/2014, 18/10/2014, 01/01/2015, 01/01/2016, 19/01/2017 and 28/03/2017. However, there has been no reply form you regarding action on the same.

In order that corruption should be curtailed, the citizens of this country had held a peaceful agitation in Ram Lila Maidan, for the establishment of the law, appointing Lokpal and Lokayukta. At that time, crores of people had come out on the streets, from scores of villages, towns and cities. Because, lives of citizens has become miserable due to large-scale corruption that directly affects their lives. Children from schools and youths from colleges had also come out on the streets. For the first-time, since Independence, such a large number of people had come out on the streets to campaign against corruption. This entire agitation was done peacefully, without any violence.

During the agitation, lakhs of people came on the streets but not one person threw a stone. Hence, this agitation was talked about respectfully in various countries across the world. Perceiving the nature of this agitation as one of public empowerment, the then government passed the law for appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta in the Rajya Sabha, on 17th December 2013 and in the Loksabha on 18th December 2013. It was passed by absolute majority in both the houses. After that, on 1st January 2014, the President of India signed the law to make it into an Act. At that time, the opposition leaders of both the houses had supported the bill. Thereafter, on 26th May 2014, your party came into power. Since then, I’ve been writing to you for three years for the implementation of the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act.

After the Lokpal agitation, the citizens, with great hope, elected the new government under your leadership. It was necessary to give the government some time for due implementation of the Acts. Keeping this in mind, I kept sending you various letters on this issue, as reminders. Neither have you implemented the same or taken any action on my letters. Nor have you had a dialogue on this issue or spoke about Lokpal and Lokayukta in your `Man ki Baat.’ Before coming to power, you had assured the citizens of India that ‘You will give priority to make India, corruption-free.’ Now, also, through large scale advertisements you convey to the public, that for the making of New India, it is necessary to take a pledge to stand against corruption. However, now also, in every State, no work of a citizen is done, without giving money. Implying, that without corruption, issues directly related to citizens, has not decreased.

With the implementation of the Lokpal and Lokayukta Law, 50%-60% of corruption can be curbed. Yet, you are not implementing this law. To curb corruption, along with Lokpal and Lokayukta Act laws like the Right to Reject and Right to Recall will help in curbing corruption. However, you are silent on these laws too. The Prevention of Bribery of Foreign Public officials and Officials of Public International Organization Bill 2011, Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill 2012, The Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill, The Public Procurement Bill 2012 are bills that will curtail corruption, but are pending for 4-5 years in the Parliament. The then government had brought in this bill, four years back. You are neither speaking nor doing anything about this delay.

In order to curb corruption and to strengthen democracy, de-centralization of power is very essential. In order to decentralize power, it is necessary to bring in Law that will strengthen the power of the Gramsabha. The village itself is the owner of its resources. There should be a law that the water, forest and land of the village should not to be taken without the permission of the Gram Sabha. The power of the secretariat should be in the hands of the people-that is, true democracy. However, despite writing letters to you for three years, you have kept mum. Then, how can India, become corruption free?

? It is not in mere making of pledges in front of the public, but in wresting rights in the hands of the people, that India will become corruption-free. The Right to Information Act, is one such example. The most distressing fact is that, despite there being such provision in the law, you are not appointing Lokpal and Lokayukta. The Supreme Court has time and again, directed you to appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta, but your government is still not doing so, despite the fact that this would curb corruption. At one end, you are appointing CBI Chief without the existence of the opposition leader and at the other end, you are giving the excuse of not appointing the Lokpal and Lokayukta, on the pretext that the opposition leader does not exist. This is most unfortunate.
It is surprising that you are giving excuses to appoint Lokayukta and Lokpal. Because, in the Lokpal and Lokayukta Law, it is not mandatory to have the opposition leader’s consent.

Even then, in these three years, no State Government, which is run by you, has appointed Lokpal and Lokayukta. In States where opposition parties have formed the government, there are no appointments of Lokpal and Lokayukta but it is unfortunate that the appointments have not been made in States that are ruled by your party. This makes it clear that you do not have the will to appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta. There is a gap between your talks and your action. Then, how can India, become corruption-free? Isn’t it a humiliation for the Parliament which passed the law, the President of India who signed it and for the citizens who campaigned for it through large scale of agitations?

What is surprising Is that of course there is no appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta in the States where opposition parties are ruling but even in States run by your party, no Lokpal or Lokayukta have been appointed.

In the Agriculture dominated country, India, farmers are committing suicide every day. I have written to you several times on giving farmers, prices as per their costs but I have not received any reply from you nor have you implemented recommendations of the Swami Nathan Committee Report. Since the last few days, farmers in various states like Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana and Rajasthan are coming together and agitating. However, you do not seem to be having any compassion for farmers’ woes. It is clear from this that you have done these amendments not in the interest of the nation and its people but in the interest of party and business owners. This is indeed unfortunate.

It has been clearly noticed over the last three years that you have no compassion in your heart for the grievances of the farmers of the country. Had it been the case, you would have made provision while making the amendments allowing the companies to give any amounts as donations to farmers instead of political parties. Had you done this, it would have strengthened our democracy and restored faith that poverty will be eliminated. It would have provided justice to poor farmers. However, your failure to do so proves that you have no compassion for the poor and farmers. Over the last 42 years, the Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill was tabled before the Parliament on several occasions but could not be passed. However, the Peoples’ Parliament of the nation awakened in August 2011 and the government had to promulgate the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act. Your government has been disrespecting public sentiments in this regard too. 
Therefore, now the time has come to awaken the voters, who are the owners of this country. An awakened voter is the foundation of democracy.

Instead, your government while using some of the amendments you have made while incorporating the Finance Bill 2017 in the Money Bill as illustrations. I shall elaborate on the remaining amendments publically at the time of the agitation. Earlier, there was provision that enabled any company to donate 7.5 per cent of the money earned as profits by it over a period of three years to political parties. However, now you have made amendment and removed the limit of 7.5 per cent and made provision that any company can donate any amount to political parties. The limit for giving donations to political parties have been removed for political parties. Because of this, not democracy but Party machinery will become stronger. If you were truly concerned about farmers and poor people, then you would have done proper research of this Law and stated that any amount of donation can be given, not to political parties but to the farmers and the poor people. That would have made democracy, strong and it would have provided justice to the farmers and poor people. However, it is very clear that you do not have the innate compassion for the poor and for the farmers. If you really want to solve the issues of the farmers, then implementing the Swami Nathan Committee Report, you would have ensured proper prices for the farmers’ produce as per the cost and in order to ensure security to farmers and laborers, it is essential to have a pension scheme.
Citizens have been campaigning for political parties to come under Right to Information Act. Supreme Court too has given clear directives. If you firmly believe in transparency, then it is essential to introspect on political parties coming under the RTI Act.


In order to decentralize power, it is necessary to bring in Law that will strengthen the power of the Gramsabha. To curb corruption, along with Lokpal and Lokayutta Act laws like the Right to Reject and Right to Recall will help in curbing corruption. It is also necessary to bring in laws for women’s’ equality. How can you talk of women’s equality just by putting up posters? In order to curb corruption and to strengthen democracy, de-centralization of power is very essential. The village itself is the owner of its resources. There should be a law that the water, forest and land of the village should not to be taken without the permission of the Gram Sabha. The power of the secretariat should be in the hands of the people-that is, true democracy. If you give the power in the hands of the citizens, then democracy will be strengthened. When the public parliament wakes up there would be a logical end to the issues of Lokpal, Lokayukta, farmers’ problems and other issues. I am confident about that.


Earlier, on 28th March, 2017, I had written a letter to you, that if you do not implement the Lokpal and Lokayukta Law, then my next letter would be about holding another agitation in Delhi. It is in reference with that letter, that I have decided to launch an agitation, for the betterment of the society and the nation.
I have been doing agitations since 35 years. However, I have my agitations were never against any political group, party or any particular individual. My only mission for doing agitations is for the betterment of the society and nation. Since the last three years, I have been reminding the government about the appointment of Lokpal and Lokayukta and of farmers receiving appropriate prices for their produce. However, you have not replied to my letters nor have you taken any action on these issues. Hence, I have decided to hold an agitation in Delhi. Until, for the larger public interest, the above issues are not addressed through implementation of the same, I will relentlessly continue my agitation. You shall be informed about my date and venue of my agitation, in my next letter.

Jai Hind!

Yours Sincerely

Anna Hazare",6

*Current situation* :

GDP growth down to 5.7%. Remember that if we use old method  of GDP calculation this 5.7% is actually 3.7%.

Inflation at 5 month high, https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi

Credit growth is down by a lot, http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/c-p-chandrasekhar/growth-in-the-time-of-a-credit-squeeze/article9795693.ece

Overall tax collections are down, http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/modi-govt-eyes-spending-cuts-as-gst-hits-tax-collection-117091800860_1.html

Job situation is abysmal, even when economy was growing at 7% the job growth rate was 1% in an already very informal economy with few jobs.

Fiscal deficit has already shot past the target, http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/indias-fiscal-deficit-reaches-92-4-per-cent-of-full-year-target-in-july/articleshow/60308723.cms

Crude price is at 4 month high. This may temporarily mean higher GDP growth because margins for oil companies etc will go up. In long term it puts more pressure on FM.

Global situation is likely to be stable.

*Questions* :-

With tax collections dropping FM cannot boost GDP with government expenditure. I doubt the government will give a stimulus package without a major hit to fiscal deficit targets.

With inflation high RBI has less leeway in reducing interest rates.

Will Govt cut spending on social schemes like NREGA so close to 2019? Will govt spend less on Armed forces?

Most importantly for me personally, will government cut corporate taxes, income taxes?

Will Modi be able to use executive prowess i.e. fast clearances, attracting investments, inspire confidence to get GDP growth back on track?

What is the actual impact of GDP slowdown to common man voter of modi?

OR **Will the GDP growth return 7+ % in next quarter and everyone will be able peacefully before the budget itself?**",6
Why Modi supporters just don't get it the problem of corporate debt. NPA's. And the recent bailout of PSU banks.,22,3k2pic,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3k2pic/why_modi_supporters_just_dont_get_it_the_problem/,24,1441733739.0,"I write this knowing that Modi supporters seriously lack understanding of the lending business,economics and business in general  and will probably make some half-assed excuse for the 75000 crore bailout but lets look at some figures.  But this needs to be said in light of todays FM meeting which will used to further bailout these idiots in corporate India who have used public money and in return just done what they have always done - misuse the capital. Not to mention are trying to force Rajan to cut interest rates to save their own ass despite savers siginficantly suffering in the last 3-4 years due to negative real interest reducing India's savings signifcantly and forcing people into risk assets like equities, (which are incidentally now down 13% from the top).

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS - Savings % gdp.

China's corporate debt to GDP is around 160% of GDP. 

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/chinas-corporate-debt-at-160-of-gdp-twice-us-level/articleshow/48141056.cms

India's corporate debt - taking into account private sector lending growth is around 53.8% . (Based on 2014 figures and credit growth).

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FS.AST.PRVT.GD.ZS

China has 3x the loan as a % of gdp. Yet has 4x lower NPA on its banks balance sheets. And despite that its banks are facing a debt crisis.  It too has implemented a lot of basel 3 norms which started around 2013 (an excuse used by Modi supporters to justify restructuring when in reality India already employs capital adequacy rations which basel 3 is has asked to be implemented by 2018 making the implementation irrelevant). Even if you take into account China's shadow banking industry its still much lower. 

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FB.AST.NPER.ZS/countries?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&sort=asc

The reason I mentioned China is because China's growth most of which has come in the last 15 years going from a 1.7 trillion economy in the year 2000, to a 10 trillion economy was not driven by FDI as most pundits in India would have believe. But by a massive expansion in credit and therefore investment . Something to the tune $40 trillion dollars. This has led to what many believe its a massive credit crisis resulting for mal-investment, and the root cause of the asset bubbles around China. Not to mention the slowdown of economy.

Latest figures show India's NPA's stood at 5.3 percent. 

http://www.livemint.com/Industry/PSkRuIxPOtkZBDECcgTHIK/Allout-efforts-on-to-bring-down-PSU-banks-NPA-Jaitley.html

So what does this tell us? 

1. Massive amount of corruption in lending especially by PSU's.
2. A small percentage of Indians mostly a few big wigs and politically connected people continue to avail loans without any significant collateral, and when they can't pay back these loans the politicians just help the restructure loans.

How times will the tax payers have to bailout these banks? Even if we do bail them out this time which we have. How long before we are at the same place again. People say oh we will implement basel 3.  But let me ask you this, India already implements most of the capital adequacy standards asked for in Basel 3 so what will basel 3 do?

All this is crony capitalism of the highest standard. 

And now with the latest meeting happening today in the finance. The corporate sleazeballs have asked for their NPA's to be restructured under a separate vehicle known as the restructure bank so 'lending can start again'. 

What really needs to be done and will never be done because the corporate 'honchos' which the fiscal hawks that Modi supporters are in awe of, continue to use PSU banks as their own piggy bank. Of course a lack of backlash because of blind supporters means nothing going to change.

In reality whats needs to be done is no restructuring and bailouts but real changes.

1.Privatise all PSU banks.

2. Create a watchdog which is independent like the RBI to oversee lending standards. 

3.Implement stronger lending standard with internetional standards to account for fraud, and international models which banks like JP morgan etc use when they lend.

Again I don't see this happening. Caravan just published an article (on Ruai's but its all the same anyway) which shows how audacious the Adanis' and Ambanis are. And how they constantly just get more and more money every year.  Meanwhile I don't expect Modi supporters to ever go against their dear leader .

So enjoy paying taxes and saving with PSU's only for your money to directed towards crony capitalism.

How BJP is ensuring their monotony in Indian politics and stay in power,0,61l7in,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/61l7in/how_bjp_is_ensuring_their_monotony_in_indian/,7,1490557961.0,"There are many polices initiated by NDA after they came to power. 
For example,
* Financial inclusion
* The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015
* Direct subsidies
* Aadhaar
* Demonetization
* Recent financial bill etc

When we take a closer look at these policies, we can see a certain pattern of corruption and dirty politics in them.

For example, **the electoral Bonds** ( http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/explaining-electoral-bonds-in-india/article9524904.ece) . This is a policy to increase the fund of the BJP and its allies. Now, people can buy this bonds and fund parties anomalously. While the identity of the donor is captured, it is not revealed to the party or public. So transparency is not enhanced for the voter. 

No doubt, The denomination has removed dirty money from the market. Now, political parties do not have access to hoarded money to fund their election just like before. In a country like India, where a good part of population is ready to sell their vote for money due to their ignorance or lack of knowledge, this is a big blow to opposing parties like congress. 

The Aadhaar became a surveillance tool for the govt. The NDA govt had amended the 2010 Aadhaar act with some scary stuff last year. Source : https://thewire.in/118655/hello-aadhaar-goodbye-privacy/

Now there are 22 mandatory notification for **voluntary** Aadhaar in this year.  Source : https://thewire.in/115125/aadhaar-timeline-mandatory-notifications/

The recent financial bill gave more (read ultimate) power to tax wing. They can inspect and seize anything they want, wherever they want and whenever they want now. 

You may ask all this are good, right? 

Maybe not. 

For example,take the example of The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015 . The penalty for nondisclosure of foreign income or assets would be equal to three times the amount of tax payable, in addition to tax payable at 30%. But if you want to get out of the hook, buy an electoral bond and bribe the party in position. The govt has guaranteed the anonymity of the donor. Sure, the issuing bank has the data of the buyer, but since all national banks are coming under a single roof under government, the promise of anonymity and receiver not knowing about the name of donor, the banks, donor and parties are safe in the bribing process. 

And, if someone want to protest against all these, be careful , you are naked in front of the govt. All your data, your financial, assets, tele identity, everything is there in front of them. What they have to do is just pull a bizarre thing like porn, torrent downloads etc into paper and screw you. Or they can seek the help of the funded medias and shame you in front of public. 

The govt. has already said that privacy is not a fundamental rights. We are losing our faith in judiciary anyway. Here is more info on mass surveillance in India. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_India 

Oh, did I forgot to tell you that babus can no longer speak against the govt? http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rules-framed-civil-servants-not-allowed-to-criticise-govt-on-social-media/story-FVEtcWbAvsM7NjmPgPqgQK.html 

India is soon going to be like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_(film) . Opposition and the elite can do nothing because they have to hide their own arse. When the lion feed on wolves, the wolves should feed on chickens. 

If you think that **if you are good all is good** , it is time to think again. We all are not ""good"" in every eyes.

Defence Wrap - Week of 14-19 March 2017,13,61m3bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/61m3bn/defence_wrap_week_of_1419_march_2017/,2,1490570902.0,"**Challenges ahead of the new Defense Minister**

* Mr. Manohar Parrikar stepped down as the Defense Minister on Mar‐13 to be sworn‐in as the Goa CM on Mar‐14. Same day Finance Minister Mr. Arun Jaitley took additional charge of the Defense Ministry.

* Rumor mills even indicate that this is a stop‐gap arrangement and soon we could see a new Defense Minister, as handling 2 key ministries would be very challenging.

* Outgoing Defense Minister resolved issues like, One Rank One Pension (OROP), rolled‐out DPP, 2016 (addressed some of the Defense procurement issues with a view to encourage private sector participation), made policy changes to encourage MSME participation in the sector.

* Policy framework to encourage private sector participation, simplification of procurement procedures were based on recommendations of committee’s set‐up by him.

* However, with new Defense Minister taking the helm of affairs, we sense the key challenge would be to take forward unfinished work by the outgoing Defense minister at the earliest.

* The ‘Make in India’ is yet to kick off, as many private players having heavily invested in the sector are awaiting on the sideways to take on government orders for ships, helicopters and land systems.

* These projects are likely to be awarded under the ‘Strategic Partnership’ policy. For over 12 months, private sector has been asking for the award of such platform projects on competitive basis, whereas government wants to select private company for a long‐term 'guaranteed work' period.

* This difference of opinion has been a long bone of contention between the industry and Defense Ministry. The new Defense Ministry has to address this big issue as private sector has been long waiting with patience.

**OFB to get order for 155mm shells from UAE**

* India had signed Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) with UAE government on Jan 25, 2017. As part of CSP (which includes areas Defense & Security) deals from Air & Naval Defense were expected to be signed sooner.

* Media reports indicate that Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) is close to bagging an order to make 155mm extended bore full range shells of boat‐tail version, which are used in Bofors‐type Artillery guns (with over 35 kms range) for UAE. Once UAE made the proposal to India in last week of Feb‐2017, India signed the agreement and UAE on its part is yet to sign the documents.

* Since the Jan 25, 2017 meeting, following are some of the key agreements signed,

 * Offshore Patrol vessels and Frigates/Corvettes (UAE has been buying them from USA, Europe),

 * supply Interceptor boats developed by L&T & Private players,

 * 100 SPAD guns project to L&T in partnership with Korean company (project to cost ~Rs 9‐10 bn).
 * Also, RDEL signed strategic MoU with Emirates Defense Industries Company (UAE based integrated defense company).

* OFB bagging this project would give major fillip to them as they have been majorly dependent on IA for their orders. OFB makes 2 versions of shells, boat‐tail and base‐bleed versions.

* Boattail version is an older version and OFB has expertise in making indigenously this variant of shell. These shells are likely to be made at OFB’s Nagpur, Chandrapur and Bhandara plants.

* OFB to‐date has exported 50‐odd products (like Brake parachutes for Su30 & MiG‐29 Fighters, 91mm TRA gun for Navy, Small caliber Ammunition, Prahari‐ the 12.7 Air Defense Gun) to countries like Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, USA and Germany.

* On being awarded this Rs 2.35bn project, OFB’s exports order‐book will zoom‐up 10x (currently exports from OFB are in Rs200‐500mn range).
* We see this development to be very positive, as this is in line with our ex‐Defense Minister’s vision to promote India as Defense export hub. Ex‐Defense Minister had set $2 bn of Defense exports target from India for next 2 years. Growing ties with Mauritius, UAE, Vietnam and Myanmar indicate that Indian Defense eco‐system is working towards achievement of the $2bn Defense exports target.

**Update on Indo‐Russian delegates meet**

* On Mar 17‐18 both, Indian and Russian Defense ministries and corporate representatives met to discuss possibilities of manufacturing spare parts and ammunition for Russian origin Aircraft and Military platforms.
* India and Russia signed 2 Long‐Term Service Agreements (LTSA) for new spares delivery schedule from Russia, a logistics hub in Bangalore and domestic manufacturing of parts by HAL for 200 Su‐30MKI fighter jets, which in future would exceed to 270 Aircrafts. As per agreement, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and United Engine Corporation (UEC) will render technical support; provide maintenance services and spares to the fleet for next 5 years worth $300mn.
* The pacts were signed between HAL and the 2 Russian companies. UAC has acquired the right to supply spare parts and do the repair and servicing of the Aircraft it delivered earlier in Dec‐ 2016 only.
* UAC also signed an agreement with HAL to provide lifecycle support and maintenance for Mi‐17 helicopters, MiG‐29K fighter jet, T‐90 tanks and INS Vikramaditya Aircraft Carrier.
* On the sidelines of an event, Russian Trade and Industry Minister, Denis Manturov revealed that M&M subsidiary is working closely in creating the interiors for Sukhoi Super Jet. Russia is negotiating with M&M on MC‐21 Aircraft, a civil aviation project, which is soon to have its maiden flight soon. Also, Russia is negotiating with M&M and other private players to manufacture components for another project 2114 (a Commercial Aircraft project).
* Another Russian official confirmed that an agreement is soon to be finalized for the supply of 60 Multi‐purpose Kazan Helicopters under Phase‐I, whereas, joint facilities would be set up in India to manufacture another 140 helicopters.
* >60% of Indian Defense Equipment platforms procured since 1960’s are of Russian origin. The current serviceability rate of the IAF and IN fleet is <50% owing to lack of spares.
* We view deals between HAL and 2 Russian companies to be big positive, as IAF would now find ease in the procurement of spares from HAL. In 2014, the serviceability rates of Su‐30MKI fighter jets were at 46%. However, post setting‐up the Rs 4 bn after sales service centre for both, Su‐30MKI fighter jets & Helicopters, the serviceability rates have increased to 60%. In other words, it means that of the total fleet size of ~230 Su‐30MKI fighter jets, ~138 of them are ready for missions at any given time.
* MoD some time back had set an ardent task of increasing the serviceability rate to ~75% levels.
* This is in‐line with MoD’s strategy to bring the entire IAF Fighter Jet fleet to global serviceability standard of ~75% levels. This could be gauged from the recent Rafale deal signed, where the French government has promised India, that Rafale will ensure 75% serviceability rate. Also, steep penalties have been imposed if timelines are not adhered.
* We see the 2 agreements between HAL and the Russian companies for technical support; provide maintenance services and spares to the fleet for next 5 years to be in‐line with MoD’s strategy to further improve the serviceability rate of the Su‐30MKI Fighter Jet fleet.
* As a result of this initiative, we expect (1) spares cost (on per unit basis) to decline, and (2) DPSU’s and smaller unlisted players to benefit.
* Also, we see positive development from M&M subsidiaries point of view, as the much awaited uptick in their Aerospace business kick‐in. However, we see some meaningful contribution from the Russian side of Aerospace to be seen from FY2018 onwards only.
* Lastly, proposed JV for manufacture of Kazan Ka‐226T was an inter‐governmental agreement
* Signed in Dec‐2015, between Russian Helicopters, JSC Rosoboronexport & HAL. This agreement
assures localization of the production and supply of 200 Light Multi‐role Ka‐226T over a period
of 9 years. First 60 helicopters of them will be produced in Russia, while the remaining 140
helicopters will be produced in India.
* On a whole, this Indian‐Russian delegates meeting concluded with 2 deals signed and making way for few more in the pipeline.

**Lakshya‐II tested successfully**

* IAF successfully test‐flew the Advanced version of Pilot‐less Target Aircraft (PTA) Lakshya‐II on Mar‐15 from the Integrated Test Range off at Odisha coast.
* During the 30 minute flight, this PTA was made to dive at different altitudes, demonstrate various technologies and subsystems including software correction.
* This PTA has a sub‐sonic and re‐usable aerial target system, is remote controlled from ground and designed to impart training to both air‐borne and air‐defense pilots.
* It’s required to evaluate and develop trials of new surface‐to‐air and air to‐air weapon systems.
The test was carried out to check the validity of its engine and duration enhancement.
* Lakshya‐II is designed and developed by Bangalore‐based Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE), a DRDO lab.

*About Lakshya Project: 
Lakshya is a reclaimable Aerial target system designed to train guns, missile crews, Air defence pilots in order to engage the targets. Powered by gas turbine engines, it is designed to be launched from land or sea through a 0‐length launcher and can be recovered by a dual‐stage parachute system. Lakshya has been designed to be reused for 15 missions.*

* Since its first test in 2012, all tests done to‐date have been successful. Still we expect induction of Lakshya‐II in to IAF would take few more quarters as few more tests are to be done.
* HAL is only company in India currently producing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s) like PTA’s.
* To‐date HAL has made 39 of Lakshya‐I at its Aircraft division, Bangalore. Of this, ~23 of them have been inducted in to IAF, IN.
* In Feb‐2015, MoD approved DRDO proposal for transfer of technology (ToT) to L&T for commercial production of Lakshya. For every Lakshya produced and commercially sold, L&T would have to pay royalty to DRDO. L&T and Tata’s have been associated with Lakshya projects since very long time. L&T produced the Launcher for the IA version and Tata’s produced the Launcher for the IAF version.
* We are of view that L&T and DRDO have already worked jointly to build the production model for Lakshya‐II.
* Also, countries like, Israel, Singapore, Malaysia in the past have shown interest to acquire Lakshya. Even though no order has been made to‐date, there exists possibility of exporting Lakshya (with MoD approval).
* On a whole, induction of Lakshya‐II in to Indian Armed Forces would be positive for companies like, HAL, L&T and Tata’s, which have been involved at different stages of manufacturing Lakshya.

**OFB to produce Mango Shells for T‐90 Main Battle Tanks**

* Tecmash, a Rostec group company announced transfer of the main part of equipment needed to OFB for enabling production of Mango Shells for T‐90 tanks in India.
* Tecmash also finished training Indian specialists for the production of Mango shells.
* Mango shells are feathered armor‐piercing projectiles for 125 mm caliber tank guns.
* Production of the shells was launched in the USSR in 1983 and put into service in 1986.
* This development comes in the back‐drop of a contract to supply 66,000 Mango Shells was signed with India in 2014 worth $ 470mn.
* We view this to be positive development as it adds one more feather to OFB’s capabilities to make Mango Shells, which are used by T‐90 Tanks. Given that the final batch of these Mango Shells was delivered recently, we do not see a large ticket awarding for these Mango shells by IA in the next 3‐6 months at least.


**IAF to get 6 new C‐130J S with Terrain Warning System**

* As per solicitation posted by US Air Force on US Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps), IAF is to get 6 new Lockheed Martin C‐130J Hercules Transport Aircraft equipped with Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS). This subscription will run for 40 months starting 31 May‐ 2017 through till 31 Aug‐2020.
* Responses for this solicitation are to be submitted by Mar‐30, 2017.
* IAF currently fields 4 C‐130Js, having ordered 6 of them in 2008 (as 2 of them met accidents).
* These 6 Aircrafts that are being solicited were contracted in Dec‐2013 for $ 1.1 bn.
* As with the current fleet, these Aircraft are to be fitted with defensive aids, Indian‐specific communication systems, and chin‐mounted electro‐optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensor turrets.
* Solicitation to get the new 6 Lockheed Martin C‐130J Hercules Transport Aircraft equipped with Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) indicates that government is focused to spend on Aircraft safety. TAWS are being deployed globally to prevent the occurrence of any accidents.
* It is after 2 of the C‐130J Hercules got damaged in 2014 & 2017 MoD took the decision to equip TAWS in to these 6 new Military Transport Aircrafts to avoid any further accidents.
* On a whole, we see this to be a positive development for the IAF fleet.

An excellent piece on funding of [P]olitical parties which seems source of all evil (read failing) of a democracy,19,6970p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6970p6/an_excellent_piece_on_funding_of_political/,0,1493927403.0,"The text at the end of this article reverberates about how essential it is for us, this is from Justice M.C. Chagla in 1975, which seems still unfixed, sadly. https://www.newslaundry.com/2017/04/04/do-transparency-and-anonymity-go-together 


Now, democracy is a political system which ensures decisions by discussion and debate, but the discussion and debate must be conducted honestly and objectively and decisions must be arrived at on merits without being influenced or actuated by any extraneous considerations. On first impression, it would appear that any attempt on the part of anyone to finance a political party is likely to contaminate the very springs of democracy. Democracy would be vitiated if results are to be arrived at not on their merits, but because money played a part in the bringing about of those decisions. The form and trappings of democracy may continue, but the spirit underlying democratic institutions will disappear. History of democracy has proved that in other countries democracy has been smothered by big business and money bags playing an important part in the working of democratic institutions and it is the duty not only of politicians, not only of citizens, but even of a Court of law, to the extent that it has got the power, to prevent any influence being exercised upon the voter which is an improper influence or which may be looked at from any point of view as a corrupt influence. The very basis of democracy is the voter and when in India we are dealing with adult suffrage it is even more important than elsewhere that not only the integrity of the representative who is ultimately elected to Parliament is safeguarded, but that the integrity of the voter is also safeguarded, and it may be said that it is difficult to accept the position that the integrity of the voter and of the representative is safeguarded if large industrial concerns are permitted to contribute to political funds to bring about a particular result.",6

I thought it would be an interesting exercise to seek your views about the Demands for Grants for ministries this year. These documents show how much money is being proposed to be allotted for every ministry. *The increase/decrease in the grants indicates the focus areas of this Government.*

[Here is a summary of all demands](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dgsum.pdf). It will help you quickly glance through the major figures.

[Another detailed summary which will help you see each demand for departments under the ministries](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/alldg.pdf)

[Ministry-wise detailed demands can be found here](http://indiabudget.nic.in/dg.asp?pageid=1)

Example of how we can go about discussing this: I found something interesting [here](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dg30.pdf) with regards to Drinking water and sanitation. The budget for the previous year Rs 12,217 cr, it has been slashed to Rs 6,243 cr.  That's a 48% reduction. I am trying to figure out why is there such a big drop and how it will affect the overall scene of national water resources. 

I must tell you that I am no expert in finance. So perhaps some of you who do work in the area can help me waddle through this massive budget? And in the process, find out what is happening to the ministries that interest you.

If you put up some interesting suggestions, I will include your inputs in the brief I am preparing for MP /u/tathagatasatpathy. 

Session resumes tomorrow and you can follow the budget discussion as it happens. I will alert /r/india regarding that everyday by putting up the [List of Business](http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Business/listOfBusinessCurrent.aspx) for the next day, so that this can become a daily input seeking session.

Some announcements, anecdotes and his own prompt response on twitter are often given as an evidence. But the reality as often is the case is more nuanced than that. Let's see some news from other side of the aisle:

> Deceleration in freight volume growth is a continuing saga at the Indian Railways. **Compared with 8.5% growth a year ago, freight volumes fell 4.2% in November this year**. In November 2013, volume grew 3%

> Even passenger volumes have dropped 2.6% 

> Thanks to rate hikes, gross earnings of the Indian Railways till October are 8% higher than the previous year. But they are almost 9% lower than the budget estimates

[Slowing rail freight volume growth points to poor state of economy](http://www.livemint.com/Money/dtcu77hT9hX5n7TgsgUMGL/Slowing-rail-freight-volume-growth-points-to-poor-state-of-e.html)
>
Freight volume growth slows to 2% in June quarter compared with 4% a year ago; In absolute terms, the incremental freight volumes have almost halved

> More than three-fifths of the Railways’ revenues come from freight services. The slowdown is not seen in revenue, thanks to the freight hikes. Goods revenues increased 6.5% in July. In the four months to July, they are up 13.5%. Though revenue growth is encouraging, it is way below the budget estimates. Thankfully, expenses are also rising at a slower-than-estimated pace. But the gap between the budget estimate and the actual amount is not as large as it is in the goods revenues.

> Compared with a year ago, expenditure on construction of new lines and doubling of tracks increased by more than one-third in the first four months of the current fiscal year

[Railway passenger fares may go up

> For freight, barring coal, the core sector is not so robust with cement, steel and construction sectors performing poorly. We may have to look at the bitter pills of increasing the passenger fares apart from cutting costs.

> Recently, the government had increased Tatkal booking charges by up to 33 per cent for travel in sleeper class, AC-III tier, AC-II tier and executive class.

>By November, the Railways had spent only 44% of its capital expenditure budget. It has spent only 41% of funds allocated for doubling.

>**Only 28% of the Rs 1,748 crore allocated for works under passenger amenities has been spent so far.**


So we see a picture of Indian railway where it's financial health is in poor state. It is not able to meet the projected revenue and it is not able to get work done as fast as it needs to even when the funds are assured.

"[R] Conflicts with mom about caste, being women and much more..",11,4j6kni,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4j6kni/r_conflicts_with_mom_about_caste_being_women_and/,8,1463178616.0,"I wanted to post this to r/relationships, but would have taken time explaining all the caste shit, so here I am.

So, I am not a bramhim. I am from OBC who doesn't have any official paper saying that I am OBC because it won't mean much (=no monetary benefits). I am from a well-off family and I won't even need any monetary help/ reservation either. My native place is pretty small.. barely a population of 500-600 peeps. All members of my family are in the upper middle class bracket (how do I know? Well, we went from shopping for groceries for 100-500 rs, to shop for ""aesthetic"" art stuff at Jahangir Art Gallery). 

Shit is about to hit the fan so buckle up!

A month ago, my relative from native place married the woman of his dreams who doesn't belong to our caste. We are all cool with it because he did really love her and so did she and she was almost like my elder sister (I don't have one). Everyone in my family is okay, however, whenever there's talk about their marriage, my mom will always quote ""see? both his (relative's father) kids married to persons from different caste"". And this tone is always so fucking terrible, and what worst that my entire clan only SHOWS to be okay with it which I found out like yesterday.

She(bride) mingles very well with the 14-21 age group in the family. She is 25 I think and my relative is 28, it doesn't matter cause they do seem great and while he has to a stable job, she works at home and runs a beauty salon in nearby city and it's going well. The relative's elder sister (40+) also married a guy outside the caste and she was completely abandoned by her parents, till they realized that she was basically handing all finances. They ""forgave"" her, yet treat as if she no longer has any business in ""her"" family.

WHAT. THE. FUCK. IS. THIS.

Now, what's worst that all the people mentioned above at at least metric (matrix pass? 12th? Idk.) rest are graduated in professional field - medicine, accounting, engineering and everyone lives in a respected society and yet this bag of deepshit!!!

Now, now, as I said I don't have a caste certificate, because my grandpa (dada) was too lazy to care about it. However, my nani got my 2 cousins registered and this blew up the family like fucking Tsar Bomba. My cousins didn't want any affiliation because we all are good in academics and we can pretty much afford the fees for general category. We (as in my cousins and I) think that it's just a disability certificate and that an entire generation hasn't used it (my mom and mamas didn't have it) so we won't use it either. Now, You would say that's good because, well we aren't being asshole, but my family literally wants us (the future gen.) to be one. Yet, these guys will criticize the ""free-loaders"" and your daily WhatsApp shitposting. If irony were indeed a person, it would have like shot itself fucking a billion times. Y U SO STUPID?

Now, as we (the new gen.) are hitting 20s, our parents are like do you like any guy/grill? Hope he/she isn't a bramhin. Don't bring us shame. While, the irony is that we all have family friends who are bramhin - that too Punekars (esp in VilleParle)!! My best friends right from school to college are bramhins. I didn't gave a fuck about it, but have to admit that bramhin make the best fucking amti in the whole universe. Take that mom!! We literraly grew up in a bramhin environment and never have I ever seen this kind of fucked up shit in ANY of my or my cousins' friends family. Like, seriously, bramhins - the ones I have met and grew up with - are the most liberal folks. YOu call them all the names, but they would alwyas stick by you and drown you in their best fucking amti with ghee. Very close knitted and very very open minded. 

Now, the guy I have been with is a bramhin and my mom knows this. She is too prude to ask me about him so she just checks my phone bill to see whom I call the most. 

OTOH, my man's mom has called me many times and we talk like 2-3 times a week, and damn she is a fucking marshmallow. I am gonna steal her if I don;t get to marry my man. She is like the most humble, yet funny mom anyone could ever have. She doesn't know shit about FB and as my man works and I am still pursuing masters, I help her with it and god, she is amazing! All his cousins and elder than us and some even have kids. I haven;t met all of them, but they too, do know about us and tease my man. Lol, he blushes more than I do :p Many of his cousins have married out of caste (I asked him out of curiosity once), but no one is really interested in gossips as long as they are happy. Only this one guy had 498A misused against him, so his clan has been a little susceptible since, but that's about it. Every lady cousin of his went to a even warm home and all his ""vahinis"" are super close and cool. Yes, they still live in a Wada. 20+ folks under one roof!! 

My parents have been separated since my birth. Later, she had a fling with this guy who abused me, but she didn;t care. I grew out of it thanks to my hostel counselor and later, this guy I met - fucking love him he is my best friend!

I am almost like a family member to his little family of three. But, my mom won;t say anything about it at all. It's like, she doesn;t care or it's breaking her heart to see me go away, whatever. his mom always ask me how was my days and we regularly chat (I am in mumbai and he and his family is in Pune). I even taught her Skype. This is like, the sunshine I want and on the other hand, my own folks are deep in the darkness like caste, shaming and shit.

Holy shit. It's 2016. Why do I even have to care about it? Aren;t we (my clan) educated? These folks will go on and on with their ultra right wing shit and India needs discipline (like dictator ship) and reservations should be abolished and shit and yet behave like living in 1600s mindset (whatever that means!).

Now, recently, my mom has got really passive aggressive about how being a women is about having family, children and stuff. 

To top it off, this is what she said when we had a talk about children.

I was telling how a painful past of a child fucks up the puberty ago/ teenage hood, to which she just said, it's the choice of parents to bring a child in this world. God has given me you so I get to choose what to do with you. To which I said, but a child is a human too, he has rights as well. To which she said, no. All children are gift of god and only parents will decide for them.  

NO. YOU HAVE SEX TO HAVE BABIES. HOLY SHIT. WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT WE ARE NOT HAVING THIS TALK????? 

Where do I go from here? I can't move out and she is like turning into some batshit fucking crazy person. She did everything on her own, bought a home, a car, raised me (in hostels though), manages all finances of her own and mine and now, she is hitting 50s and this shit has started. She goes like, now you'll be gone (married) and then who will look after her as she doens;t even have a son and shit like that. 

I am losing my shit. and this IS NOT a shitpost. 

**TL;DR** conflicts with mo as to different opinions.. things have changed, but mindset hasn't.. All of a sudden, caste and caste shaming is getting attention in family even though we were pretty much general category.",6
Markandey Katju thinks that India is heading towards a 'revolution'.,12,63reu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63reu2/markandey_katju_thinks_that_india_is_heading/,1,1491491104.0,"""India is heading for a Revolution

India is inevitably heading for a revolution. Why do I say so ? Let me explain

India is potentially a highly developed country, but actually a poor and backward country.

It is potentially a highly developed country because it has two of the basic requirements to be a highly developed country, viz. a huge pool of technical talent, and immense natural resources.

This was not the position in 1947 when India became independent. The British policy was broadly to keep India backward, feudal and largely unindustrialized, so that Indian industry may not emerge as a big rival to British industry. So we were not permitted by our British rulers to set up a heavy industrial base, but were permitted only some light industries like textiles, plantations, etc which, too, for a long time were mainly under British ownership. So till 1947 we had very few industries and very few engineers

The position today in 2017 is very different. Today we have a heavy industrial base, and a huge pool of competent engineers, technicians, scientists, managers, etc. Our I.T. engineers are manning Silicon Valley in California, and American Universities are full of our our mathematics and science professors.

In addition, we have immense natural wealth. India is not a small country like England or Japan. It is almost a continent.

So we have all that is required to be a first rate modern, highly developed country, like North America or Europe.

And yet the reality is that we are an underdeveloped, poor country, with massive unemployment, malnourishment, lack of healthcare, good education, etc for our masses.

We can consider some facts :

1. the level of unemployment can be gathered from two facts (a) 1 crore ( 10 million ) youth are entering the Indian job market every year, but only 1.4 lac ( 140, 000 ) jobs are being created every year in the organized sector of the Indian economy. So where do the remaining 9.86 million youth go ? They become hawkers, street vendors, bouncers, criminals, the girls often become prostitutes, and many end up as suicides. In 2015 the U.P. govt. advertised 358 jobs of peons ( chaprasis, i.e. class 4 employees ) for which there were 23 lac ( 2.3 million ) applications. 250 of the applicants had Ph.D. degrees, 2500 were M.Sc., M.B.A. engineers, etc all begging for a [peon's job](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/phd-holders-among-23-lakh-applicants-for-peon-jobs-in-up/story-OqHzHbvo16gUN2DfTkfYlI.html). Something similar happened when police constable's jobs were advertised in Madhya Pradesh, and peon's jobs in West Bengal

2. 50% Indian children are malnourished., which is a situation far worse than in sub Saharan countries of Africa like Somalia. A [UNICEF](http://unicef.in/Story/1124/Nutrition) report says that one out every [three malnourished child in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition_in_India) is an [Indian child](https://www.savethechildren.in/resource-centre/articles/malnutrition-in-india-statistics-state-wise).

3. Poor people in India have hardly any access to healthcare. There are no doubt some excellent hospitals in big cities of India, but they are exorbitantly expensive. Poor patients simply cannot afford good doctors. AIIMS, ( All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, ) looks like a railway station, with thousands of people sitting there, and no one caring for them, unless one is rich or powerful.. So where do the poor people go when they fall sick ? They go to quacks. Quackery is rampant in India.

4. The govt. spends a huge amount of money on I.I.T.s and elite institutions like JNU, but hardly anything for primary schools in villages, where the foundation of knowledge is laid.

5. [57 individuals in India control 70% of India's wealth](http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-interviews-blog/57-billionaires-control-70-of-indias-wealth-india-is-second-most-unequal-economy-after-russia/)

6. Far from there being any 'vikas', the Indian economy is lying stagnant, with chances of genuine growth remote. Whatever 'growth there has been has only benefited a handful of crony capitalists, but not the Indian masses.

According to Mark Twain, there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. Statistics is such a wonderful thing that with its help one can manufacture any figure one wants, like a conjuror pulling a rabbit out of a hat.

The latest figures given by the government of India authorities claiming 7.9 percent growth in GDP in the last quarter is an excellent example, and reminds one of Lord Haw Haw (William Joyce), or the Nazi propaganda minister, Dr Goebbels, who kept proclaiming on radio to the German people right till the very end that Germany was winning the Second World War – when in fact it was losing.

According to this claim, the Indian economy is the fastest growing economy of the world, outstripping the growth in GDP of the Chinese economy, which grew by only 6.9 percent in the same period. Evidently, according to this figure, we are heading for an El Dorado some time in the future, and as Dr Pangloss would say (see Voltaire’s ‘Candide’ ), quoting the German philosopher Leibniz, this is the best of all possible worlds.
But a scrutiny of these figures throws up several doubts. Are the figures true or dressed up, like a Potemkin village? Also, assuming they are true, is this GDP growth benefiting the Indian masses, or only a handful of big businessmen?

Exports have fallen from $187.29 billion in the period April -October 2014, to $156.29 billion in the period April-October 2015, ie a drop of 17.6 percent. So if exports have fallen, and manufacturing has grown by 9 percent, as claimed by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, where have the increased quantity of goods manufactured been sold? In the home market?

But India is a poor country, with 80 percent people holding little purchasing power. And with the sharp escalation in food prices, real incomes have really gone down.

According to the statement of Raghuram Rajan, the RBI governor, most factories are running at 70 percent of their capacity, while in 2011-2012 they were running at 80 percent of their capacity. This apparently shows manufacturing decline, rather than growth. According to a Business Standard report, corporate profitability is below one percent on an average.

Bad loans by banks continue to mount. According to CARE, non-performing assets during July-September, 2015 stood at about Indian Rs3.37 lac crore, an increase of Indian Rs71,000 crore. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, the number of stalled projects – the bulk of them in the manufacturing and infrastructure sectors – went up. Small and medium enterprises are having a difficult time trying to survive. The real-estate sector, which provides a lot of jobs, is down in the dumps, with construction of new buildings going down, and the number of unsold homes going up.

An article by Andy Mukherjee published by Reuters states that the GDP growth of the Indian economy is one third a statistical mirage, and real GDP growth is more likely to be about 5 percent rather than 7.4 percent as claimed by the Indian authorities. Mukherjee says:

>“The illusion comes from a recent supposed improvement in the way India calculates its Gross Domestic Product. In theory, Indian authorities claim that Indian GDP is close to international standards. In practice it has become utterly unreliable.”

What is the real GDP growth of the Indian economy? [Breakingviews.com](https://www.breakingviews.com/) answered that question by looking at three indicators: corporate earnings, auto sales and imports of computer software (since retained earnings finance new investment projects, auto sales are a proxy for consumer demand while software imports reflect productivity gains). Mixing the three in a simple index suggests that growth in the most recent quarter was closer to 5 percent.

But let us assume that the 7.9 percent figure is correct. The further question that still remains is: is this GDP growth benefiting the Indian masses, or just a handful of big businessmen? Is the rich-poor divide growing? Dilip Shanghvi, Gautam Adani, Mukesh Ambani, Aziz Premji, Pallonji Mistry, etc are worth billions of dollars, while the majority of Indians are struggling to make both ends meet, as prices of food soar.

What has happened to the slogan ‘sab ka saath, sab ka vikas’? It seems it was only a ‘jumla’. The communal fire is being stoked up again in UP and elsewhere. When there is an economic crisis which the govt. cannot resolve, it resorts to fascist methods, as it happened in Germany and Italy with the rise to power of Hitler and Mussolini

India stands at 135th in human development out of the approximately 200 countries in the world. For more on [this](http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2014/jul/25/India-Ranks-135th-in-Human-Development-Index-639966.html)

To abolish all this, and raise the standard of living of our people – that must be the goal of all patriotic modern minded people--. we have to create a modern, highly industrialised country in which all our citizens are getting decent lives.
But what has this government done in this direction? The answer is: a big zero, and only jumlas and dramas.
The test of every government or system is one – and only one: is the standard of living of the masses rising under it or not? If not, the government or system is a failure. From this standpoint (and it is the only correct standpoint), the Modi government, like the previous Manmohan Singh govt., is a total failure on all fronts
The question naturally arises that when we have all that is required to be a first rate highly developed country, why is India still poor and backward ?
The answer is that apart from the two requirements to become a highly developed country mentioned above, viz. a huge pool of technical talent, and huge natural resources, there is also a third requirement, which unfortunately we do not have, and that is a modern minded, patriotic political leadership. Let me explain this in some detail.
India borrowed the parliamentary system of democracy from England, and incorporated it into our Constitution. Now parliamentary democracy is based on majority vote, but the truth is that the vast majority of people in India are intellectually very backward, their minds full of casteism, communalism and superstitions. So when most indians go to vote they do not see the merit of the candidate, whether he is a good man or bad, educated or not, etc, but only see the candidate's caste or religion ( or the party representing a caste or religion ). That is why there are so many people with criminal antecedents in our legislatures.

Our cunning politicians take advantage of this, and have learnt the skill of manipulating caste and religious vote banks.

The interest of the nation is to rapidly modernize, for which it is necessary to destroy feudal forces like casteism and communalism. On the other hand, the interest of our politicians is to win the next elections, and for that they have to appeal to, and therefore perpetuate, casteism and communalism, which are feudal forces. Therefore the interest of our country, and the interest of our politicians are diametrically opposite to each other. How, then, can our country progress ?
Most of the Indian politicians are rogues, rascals, gundas, criminals, scoundrels, looters and gangsters. They have no genuine love for the country, but only seek power and pelf. They are shameless and incorrigible, and cannot be reformed. They are experts in manipulating caste and communal vote banks, and they polarize society by spreading caste and communal hatred. Don't such people deserve to be shot, like mad dogs, or like the aristocrats in the French Revolution who were guillotined?
It is thus obvious that parliamentary democracy is not suited to India. Our Constitution has exhausted itself, our 'democracy' has been hijacked by feudal minded people, and all our state institutions have become hollow and empty shells.

On the other hand, the socio-economic distress of our people keeps mounting.

I submit that the solutions to the massive problems of India lie outside the system, not within it. No amount of reforms will do, what is now required is a revolution. What form this revolution will take, and how much time, cannot be predicted, but what certainly can be predicted is that it is coming.
It is only after such a revolution, which will be led by some genuinely patriotic, modern minded persons, that a just social order will be created in India, in which our masses get decent lives, and a high standard of living.""

Example of Unintended Consequences - IIM Selections [NP],19,376j2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/376j2w/example_of_unintended_consequences_iim_selections/,17,1432569255.0,"I have been planning to write about this for some time now. I was associated with MBA preparation industry for a long time and wanted to write about how something good like RTI ended up spoiling the selection process at IIMs.

Background - Till few years ago, anyone could dream to be in IIMs, even if you have bad marks in school and college. Get a good percentile and if you show great acumen in the interviews, there is a good chance you will get selected. I know of people who scored ~50% in graduation and could get through top IIMs. 

Was the selection process subjective - Yes

Then RTIs came into picture and people started asking for details on selection and objectifying the criteria. I have to mention it here that that the authorities at IIMs have the pleasure of plenty. It is a rejection process than a selection process. So, rather than instituting a better process they added qualification criterion (e.g. Marks in Xth, XIIth, Grad etc) and only if you clear that, you get shortlisted for an interview. So now, in the past few years, students who have performed exceptionally well in academics throughout their life can only dare to apply to IIMs (no pun intended :p).

It is my personal view that when you are creating Business managers, curriculum marks are hardly an indicator. Skills like Relationships, People Management, Creativity, Street smartness are missing in the people who have been academic all their lives. They can be really great as number crunchers and a domain like Finance suits them well. 
Hence in the past few years, b-schools have been creating degree holders, not business managers.

So, I think there are 2 unintended consequences of this - 

1) RTI in spite of being a good tool, ended up making lot of deserving people miss the bus, of course helped by the laziness of the selection authorities.

2) The folks who are smart, are starting up.

I am one of those few lucky people who is getting an opportunity to meet Raghuram Rajan Personally at RBI headquarters in Mumbai. I would like to know any thing specific you would like me to ask him? 
The question can be related to any of 

Please specify the context of your question to get a clarity I shall respond soon.  



  
1. In November 1994, printing of 1 rupee notes was terminated predominantly due to the prohibitive cost of printing. As far as this goes, why does RBI want to put them in circulation again?  


  
If you have any such question then let me know. Will soon update after the meet

EDIT : 
  
Proof that I met him : [Raghuram Rajan's Autograph](http://imgur.com/bE58vPc)

He didn't answer all the questions but some if which he did answered are jotted down 
 
**Regarding PSU Banks**   

He says that large banks i.e the big players didn't want to have regulators for small banks and wanted to avoid that. But He (R_R) believed that they stand an equal chance as them and deserved to compete in the market. They need to be given opportunity to create a business and shape-up the economy.   
He quoted saying "" If they can't compete then don't deserve to exist ""  

**Regarding Bitcoin**  

RBI didn't fail to understand bitcoin, it just alarmed people that its highly volatile. He was quite fascinated by the innovation of bitcoin but at the same time believes that they can't replace the currency as over-regulation might happen anytime with it and you can't control it.   
He cited the example of movie ' GURU ' of how he tried to regulate the business but ended up failing to decide the future of what he was doing.  

*""It's a good innovation and the direction is right but need something more stable, and BITCOIN isn't the answer""*
   
**Regarding how is his communication with FM,PM and other institutes**

He jokingly answer it by telling *'using phone, emails, fax and letter'* but then told that there were certain discontent between them while deciding on policies and public matters of which  some results of the meeting weren't what he wanted.  

**On GST**

Lesser people pay tax-logistics but he believes GST will allow more people to pay the tax and improve efficiency

**His Advice to Youngsters** 

*""Challenge yourself. Don't Do boring stuff. If its interesting, Learn it. Don't be a master in one thing, move to other challenges once you master one thing, that will help you remain down to earth.""*  

**Asked him when he plans to join Quora**   
His reply - *What's Quora?*

I can't right all the things he mentioned but some of them which I felt would give the gist of what he meant is mentioned. 

  
P.S : I ain't from Finance background, I am an engineer. So pardon my finance jargon or something which you didn't understand, please let me know; will try to rectify it for understanding

Even if the country is burning, world being destroyed the mainstream media will sensationalize and entertaining.

Publications blogs, columns, reports still have some value but TV media is useless.

How do you deal with tough financial situations in family?,10,3bm6ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3bm6ik/how_do_you_deal_with_tough_financial_situations/,16,1435687258.0,"I hate to discuss this but my family is fucked up in terms of finances. My dad owns one running business and holds properties across about 5-10 Cr, mostly farm lands. 

Elder brother is 33 and college-dropout, has 3 children and has been failing in both business and politics with constant record since past 14 years. He has started over 10 businesses over period of time, all after convincing/pressurizing my father to invest into it and he keeps failing. His failed business ventures have costed family at least 5 Cr loss over period of time. Dad pays for his daily expenses, including his 3 children and wife. Now you may think of kicking out such people out of house if you are young, but you have to understand it's no more practical. He has 3 little kids, and a wife who though supports him but inside regrets marrying this loser but can't even complain since this was their ahaa love-marriage. 

Now I do my little shit and keep my finances separate from them. But that does not help. Elder brother keeps taking money from me ( he's around 10 years elder). And in most cases I'm unable to refuse because I'm still not comfortable telling no to people ( you can call me yes-man), and if I don't give him, and expenses have to be met, so he'll only go to dad's business and take money. So this way sort of I help dad share the burden.

But now I've even started hating dad. He said I should take a FD in his bank because it offers better interest ( it didn't) but then he convinced me, it will help him show good will there and what not and his credit limited would be extended etc etc. Then yesterday was FD maturity day and I'm simply told my money was taken for some equipment at his business. NO FUCKING EXPLANATION and its told like I shouldn't mind it. I didn't react because I know I'm never seeing that money again. If I talk loud, I'll see a sad face as to how he is old and how he supports my elder brother's family etc etc.

Now I'm sitting here raging in anger. How do you guys deal such situations?? I know I should move out so please don't tell me that.",6

COI: Constitution of India
GOI: Government of India
UOI: Union of India


In the Friday class of last week we had an elaborate discussion on the what
constitutes a state under Article 12 under COI. As discussed in last post,
Article 12 says.


> In this Part, unless the context otherwise required, ""the State"" includes the
> Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of
> each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of
> India or under the control of the Government of India.

Last time we discussed how definition here is context dependent. You should
also notice that it say """"the State"" includes"", that means the definition is
not limited to the items provided in the list and it can be expanded depending
on the interpretation. The list is:

* The Government
* Parliament of India
* The legislature and Government of each of the States
* Local Authorities
* Other Authorities

Interpretation of government, parliament and legislature as they are defined
within the constitution and definition of local authorities is to be
interpreted with respect to to General Clauses Act 1897 as mentioned in Article
367 of COI. There are two things to notice here, first is that the list doesn't
mention Judiciary. Our professor mentioned that there is much debate about
interpreting judiciary as ""state"" in Article 12, but he didn't give much
details. The other thing is that ""Other Authorities"" is not defined and over
the course of time our courts have used this to expand the scope of fundamental
rights considerably by bringing more and institutions under scope of Part III
by interpreting them as ""Other Authorities"".

One of the first cases that raised that tried to interpret ""other authorities""
in Article 12 are _[University of Madras vs Shantha
Bai](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/233848/)_ which came to Madras High Court in
1954 and _[B W Devadas vs Karnataka Engineering
College](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1084632/)_ which came to Karnataka High
Court in 1963. To interpret these cases the court used the principle of
""ejusdem generis"" which says that a general word should be interpreted in the
light of specific words which it follows. For example if I say ""apple, banana,
orange, etc"", then pineapple can be interpreted as ""etc"" but not cricket bat.
In other words there should be common thread running between the specific words
and whatever we interpret as the general word.

In these cases the court said that all the specific authorities mentioned are
involved in discharging sovereign functions. Sovereign functions are functions
which can only be discharged by State and not by any private entity, for
example, managing foreign relations, levying taxes and maintain law and order.
Since the authorities in question are universities and since the function of
imparting education is not a sovereign function, universities cannot be
considered state under ""other authorities"".

The first case that came to supreme court in this regard is the case of
_[Rajasthan Electricity Board vs Mohan
Lal](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/459864/)_ in 1967. It was an employment
related issue where Mohan Lal claimed that the action of 
Board is unconstitutional under Article 14 (Equality before Law) and Article 16
(Equality of Opportunity in matters of public employment) of COI.

The Electricity Board, citied the principle of ""ejusdem genesis"" and said it
has been created to carry out commercial activity of distributing electricity,
which is not a governmental activity, hence it is not state under Article 12.
The court rejected the principle of ""ejusdem genesis"" and used the dictionary
meaning of the word ""Authority"". Court said:

_""[Authority is] ""a public administrative agency or corporation having quasi-
governmental powers and authorised to administer a revenue- producing public
enterprise."" ... The expression ""other authorities"" is wide enough to include
within it every authority created by a statute and functioning within the
territory of India, or under the control of the Government of India""_

Since Rajasthan Electricity Board was created through a statue it should
considered a state

Justice Shah gave the same judgement with a different reasoning, he said

_""The State Electricity Board has the power of promoting coordinated
development, generation supply and distribution of electricity and for that
purpose is invested by the State with extensive powers of control over
electricity undertakings, The power to make rule and regulations and to
administer the Act is in substance the sovereign power of the State delegated
to the Board.""_

In the subsequent case of _[Sukhdev vs Bhagat
Rao](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/426032/)_ Justice Matthew highlighted that
the function of the state is to provide welfare to the people and is not
limited to performing sovereign functions. The case involved three public
cooperations Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, the Life Insurance Corporation
and the Industrial Finance Corporation. He said that these corporates are
**instruments** of the state to carry out business of public importance.
Whatever is the method through which these corporates came about, creations of
corporates should not decrease the responsibility of state. Hence these should
be considered ""state"" under Article 12.

Should I get an MBA? [NP],6,3ewrql,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ewrql/should_i_get_an_mba_np/,9,1438126970.0,"Currently, I am a undergrad student majoring in Finance in Thailand. I will be done in December. I haven’t done 10+2 –> only did the IGCSEs. My dad runs a jewellery business which I will join if I do not go for Masters. I have no prior knowledge about the business and I will move to India to train myself (it has been taken care of).

I am considering an option and would like an opinion on this matter. I was thinking that while I learn my family business under someone else’s guidance, I also prepare myself for CFA. Since I am already a Finance undergrad, I will be furthering my studies in my field of interest. This would mean I can learn about how to handle a business and earn a CFA (provided I pass). But this would also mean boycotting the MBA.

Also, maybe pursue a Gemological Institute of America (GIA) course at some point – although unlikely.

How do you think of my plan? Will it be wise to not pursue MBA? I am uncertain if this is the right way to go and would love to have opinions. ",6
"If you are above 21 and/or are working, here's how you can utilize the upcoming AMA.",69,2lgd86,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2lgd86/if_you_are_above_21_andor_are_working_heres_how/,5,1415287315.0,"If there's one thing that we, here on /r/India, can all agree on is that Money is important. Not just for the economy of our country but also for us as individuals.  Personal finance, in very simple words, is the management of *your own* Monetary resources. . And although it may seem like a term that is thrown around a lot only recently, your parents and grandparents, etc have, in fact, practised it in some form too. For example: If you send money to your parents every month, that is a return on their investment in you. If you've seen your parents set aside a part of their money every month to pay for bills and fees, that is budgeting. In fact, all monetary decisions that they've taken in their lives, as a family, come under the subject matter of personal finance.


So, just like we try and focus on our physical, mental and spiritual health, focusing on developing our financial health is important too and hence, matters of personal finance and investing your time in understanding it is of significance to EVERYBODY who draws a salary or earns an income from a business/profession.


Although we, at /r/IndiaInvestments do try our best to address your queries on the matters of personal finance too, but [the person we have coming over](http://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/2l56m0/upcoming_ama_manish_chauhan_founder_of/) has been in the financial advisory business for quite a while and his blog and books are of quite a lot of repute for their resourcefulness to not just other financial advisers, but also for people who are trying to improve their personal financial health.


Now, **if you're wondering how you could capitalize on this AMA**, ask yourself if you've ever had any of the following questions in mind at some point of time in your life: 


* I (or somebody I know) have had bad experiences with the stock market, Or, I don't understand any of it so I'd rather stay away. What am I missing?



* I can see that a particular stock/scheme has been doing well for the past few months, should I go All-in?


* I have surplus savings. Should I repay my home loan or invest it elsewhere?


* Planning to quit my job and start out on my own, How do I decide if I can afford to quit?


* What is the best way to deal with the bonus that I just received?


* We are expecting a child and would like to see the child get the best kind of education. What can I do starting today towards that?


* I've always wanted to visit Japan, but ever since I started working, something or the other comes up and I barely have enough money to even think about it. What do I do?


* Mutual Fund ratings and stock broker recommendations. How much of these should I trust?


* I have bought an endowment/ULIP insurance plan recently. Can I feel confident that my family is secured?


* What is the difference between a Life Insurance policy, Health insurance policy and a Personal Accident cover? Do I need these?


* I just saw this advertisement about an IPO. All my friends are investing in it. Should I?


* I am an NRI. I hear that the interest rates on fixed deposits are upto 9%-10% in India. Should I send my money to invest in India?


* I am an NRI and I expect the rupee to get stronger. Should I convert all my savings now?


* It's tax declaration time and I am looking for tax savings product. What do I do?


* What happens if I don't file my Income Tax returns?


* A friend/relative of mine suggests that I put in money in a certain stock or scheme or business venture. What are the points that I need to keep in mind before I take a plunge?


* I have a CA friend who helps me file taxes every year. Do I still need a financial planner?


* Are financial planners only for the rich? 


* How do I evaluate a financial planner?


* A portion of my salary goes towards EPF, does that mean I'll have enough money when I retire?


* Besides extra penalty interest, what's the worse that can happen if I don't pay my credit card bills?


*Note: These questions are in no way comprehensive and will not be asked by us. These are instead aimed at activating that part of your mind that thinks about this stuff.*


You could ask questions along similar lines and more in the upcoming AMA. Make sure you include as many details as possible. Use throwaways if you are not comfortable with talking about your financial information.

Hey everyone, thanks for reading. The upcoming school year, I will travel to India (from the Netherlands) to study at Amrita University. The folks from the exchange office are really helpful and the process is going pretty smooth, but I still have some questions which I hoped (some of) you could help me answer.

I would like to know:
-How intensive/stressful is studying at Amrita (is there a difference between foreigners and Indians)?
-Which campus should I choose?
-How is campus life and how much free time will I have?

Of all the cities with campuses, I have only been to Bangalore (yet only briefly). I did not like the city very much, but I heard that it is the IT capital of India.

I am currently studying International Business and I want to follow mostly courses on finance when I go to Amrita. I have looked at a number of electives and I the finance courses quite appeal to me. Furthermore mathematics and technology greatly interest me. I would like to travel as much as possible and learning Hindi would be a priority for me.

Please share with me your experiences, tips, tricks and other things you think will be helpful.

Thanks a lot in advance!

"What would Arvind Kejriwal, IRS have done?- Arun Jaitley",6,2uqpex,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2uqpex/what_would_arvind_kejriwal_irs_have_done_arun/,8,1423072817.0,"Some disillusioned members of the AAP have taken up the case of the party’s dubious funding. The AAP is a brilliant propagandist. It claims to wear the label of honesty on its sleeves. It disclosed the names of a large number of corporate entities from whom it received donation by cheque. The disillusioned AAP members appear to have conducted a search of these with the Registrar of Companies. The search uncovered the curious character of the donor companies.


The companies do not do any business. They have no profits from any legitimate business. They are “Entry lending companies”. The functioning of these “entry lending companies” is very simple. At times there are a large number of inter-connected companies created through a multi layering process. Money is got transferred from one to another. The companies are registered at obscure addresses. The directors of these companies are unknown people, usually name lenders for a miniscule consideration. These directors are usually low paid employees of those behind the racket. These companies are used either for hawala payments or round tripping of their own funds. They convert cash into cheque.


Most of these ingredients are present in the case of the companies which are donors of AAP. Surely, when a company donates lakhs and crores to a political party, the party would attempt to know as to who the controlling interest behind these companies are? The only fact that the donations have been made by cheque does not purify the transaction. Withdrawal from Swiss bank accounts can also be made by cheques. Where a political party converts black money into white, its receipt would obviously be by cheque. That cannot wash away the sins of the convertor or the recipient since the entire transaction is fraudulent and a tax evasion exercise. Arvind Kejriwal is not a novice to India’s taxation laws. He is a former officer of the Indian Revenue Service. He knows very well that such transactions are dealt with under the Income Tax Act and not the Indian Penal Code. Why does he then dare the Finance Minister to arrest him? Is it only a bluff and bluster exercise? A company can donate a maximum of 7½ (seven and half) percent of its average net profit of the three preceding financial years to political party. Did the recipient Aam Aadmi Party verify this fact? Did it verify the controlling interest behind these companies? Can it even now tell us who was the individual who brought these donations and whether he had the financial resources to pay or was it a round tripping of its cash available?


If Kejriwal were still a Revenue Service officer and a case of such money conversion through sham companies resulting in donations to a political party had landed on his table, what he would have done? Would he have asked the assessee to write a letter to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India or allowed him to argue that a payment by cheque to political parties forgives all sins of black money conversion? Would he have arrested the fraudulent assessee under the Indian Penal Code rather than proceeding under the Income Tax Act? Surely Kejriwal is not a stranger to the tax laws. He knew what his party was doing. He should be honest enough to tell the people what “Arvind Kejriwal, IRS” would have done under these circumstances?",6
How will the Indian banking crisis end?,5,4l9vo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4l9vo7/how_will_the_indian_banking_crisis_end/,2,1464367311.0,"SBI today reported that its GNPA has risen significantly. Other PSU banks are worse. Govt is talking about consolidating 20 odd PSU banks into 6, but is unwilling to bail them out totally with public money. How do you think this is going to unravel? Should Govt bail out the banks and thereby ensuring the job security of the employees? Or should the Govt let economics decide the fate (in which case there will be a need of massive down-sizing imo)?

DAE think Amartya Sen is playing a long game with his recent partisan comments?,2,1j9bdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1j9bdk/dae_think_amartya_sen_is_playing_a_long_game_with/,46,1375102453.0,"Play along with me for a minute.

1. Sen has been making clearly partisan comments wherein he is kissing up to the Gandhi family, while spitting at those who are against the Gandhi family.

2. Sen knows that UPA is done for in the next elections. Which means, Pappu will go run behind his mummy's skirts after the trouncing in 2014.

3. Sen might be hoping that by 2019 or earlier, whichever government is in power, may be facing anti-incumbency. If it is a third-front banana republic govt, it will happen much earlier than 2019. Even if it is an NDA govt, Sen might be hoping that people will not like the Modi-brand of governance and there will be high anti-incumbency factor. High hopes, but everyone can dream!

4. So, Sen might see a possibility for UPA to come back in 2019 or earlier. But now, Pappu has not recovered from his 2014 trouncing. He, his mummy and other Congis have realized that Pappu's role is better relegated to the background where he has all the authority, and zero accountability. Exactly like his mummy. So, they have to find a slave PM who *appears* acceptable to Indians, which could be Chidambaram. Chidambaram could be for Pappu, what MMS is to Sonia. In that case, who will be the Finance Minister? Why? Our own Nobel laureate, of course.

**5. And who knows, a few more years down the line, once the trend of FMs becoming PMs has been well established by MMS and PC, Sen could also claim the PM's seat.**

Can't an economist with questionable economic theories dream? After all, other than being an economist, he has another crucial qualification that could make him a very acceptable PM candidate for Indians: a white-skinned foreign wife! Sen the economist and [his big banking family wife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Georgina_Rothschild) could continue with the looting of India, which has been going on for centuries now, almost unbroken. Except, Mr and Mrs Sen would bring a whole new level of sophistication to it, making Sonia-Rajiv-Quattrocchis look like amateur small timers. After all, Mrs Sen's family's bank has already managed to get a [fat 30+ crore-rupee fee](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/thomas-k-thomas/sbi-caps-keen-on-spectrum-auctioneer-job/article3704210.ece) from the UPA govt for one of the spectrum auction/sale. How many more such contracts could be in the pipe-line for that bank, [which is already expanding in India](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rothschild-india-to-start-ipo-advisory_510923.html), when Mr and Mrs Sen have the reins of highest power in the country?

[p] India in few years. A possible scenario?,0,2vfd9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2vfd9w/p_india_in_few_years_a_possible_scenario/,18,1423612642.0,"So BJP is scared , very scared seeing what just happened at Delhi elections. BJP 's vote share hasn't changed since last elections . Other votebank got consolidated ( mainly lower class and a particular community shifted towards AAP)

Lower class voted for AAP because freebies . 

Particular community voted for AAP because AAP was the only party which was capable to stop BJP from making a goverment.

In short It is a mandate against development and wealth creation.

Scary thing is this phenomena  can be replicated in various parts of country

In order to win in 2019 BJP will do following 

1-  Will stop development agenda and reforms

2-  Bring many  populist schemes in coming years

3-  Consolidate Hindu votes because a particular community never votes for it , no matter what . This will lead to appeal for hindutava for consolidation.

While doing above 3 things, following will the result.

1- Fiscal deficit will go to a toss because government will borrow more to finance the populist scheme.

2- Very little resources will be spent on infrastructure, defense, education 

3- FDI will get reduced because no infrastructure, no incentives .

4- Corp-Tax will be increased to finance the freebies which will hurt the competitiveness of business in global market.

5- EXport will get reduced because our industry won't be able to compete with China.

6- Import will get increased 

7 - Rupee will have a free fall

8-  Balance of Payment crisis.

9-  Oil price might be recovering and reaching $ 100/bl

10- India will become a defaulter country .

11-India's reserve oil will get over in 2-3 weeks.

12- China will attack seeing our vulnerability

You should know about Enron - the erstwhile energy giant who had invoked counter-guarantee to auction govt properties and whose bills were more than 60% of India's annual rural development budget.,12,3wcjxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3wcjxm/you_should_know_about_enron_the_erstwhile_energy/,2,1449849356.0,"This text might be bit longer and I will do my best to annotate, bear with me please. This is another You should know thread inspired by the previous earlier you should know thread about Paranjoy Guha thakurta, Srinivas Reddy and Press Council of India. Since that was successful, let's see how it goes.

Let's start with a story, a tale that we might not know but we should know and be cautious (hopefully).

1) Enron, Houston based natural gas company,  now defunct, had had a sweetheart deal with our country. What is a sweetheart deal? [1]

2) Enron project was the first private power project in India. Congress ruled maharashtra state government entered into a **power purchase agreement** with Enron and a 695 megawatt power plant was signed in 1993. BJP and Shiv Sena -then in opposition - went all desi and filed legal proceedings against Enron and state govt. Next year, that was their only campaign issue.

3) Feb 1995 - BJP and Shiv Sena won the elections. They were righteous and **scrapped** the project. Mr. Advani - then leader of opposition in parliament - termed it as 'loot through liberalization'. He sort of accused Congress govt of taking a **695 crore bribe** from Enron. Enron said that it had paid millions of dollars for *educating* the politicians and bureaucrats, so that they understand the significance of the project.

4)  After the project was cancelled, US govt began to pressure the MH govt. [2] US ambassador Frank Wisner, deplored the cancellation. **It is purely coincidental that the day he completed his term as ambassador, he joined Enron as director.** [3]. 

5) November 1995 - BJP and Shiv Sena appointed a *re-negotiation* committee. 

6) May 1996 - Minority govt headed by BJP was sworn in as centre. It lasted for exactly 13 days before resigning to face a vote of no-confidence in Lok Sabha. On it's **last day at office**, despite of the no-confidence motion in progress, the cabinet met for a hurried lunch and re-ratified the national govt's counter-guarantee for the Enron project (which had become void since the earlier contract was cancelled). 

7) August 1996 - The MH govt singed a fresh contract with Enron. [4] 

8) The previous contract had involved annual payments to Enron of $340 million for phase 1 (695 MW) with phase 2 (2015 MW) being optional. The re-negotiated power purchase agreement made phase 2 mandatory and legally binding on MH State electricity board (MESB) to pay Enron a sum of **30 billion**.  It was the largest ever contract in Indian history. The gross profits were around $12 to $14 billion dollars. **The official return on equity was more than 30%, which was double of what is permissible under Indian law.** [5]

9) The increase of 18% of installed capacity caused MSEB to put 70% of it's revenue to be able to pay Enron. NOICE.

10) May 1997 - Supreme court refused to entertain an appeal against Enron. 

11) 2001 - Everything that was critiqued against the project, came back to haunt. The power produced was twice as expensive as the nearest competitor and seven times expensive of the cheapest electricity available in MH. [6]

12) May 2000 - MH Electricity regulatory committee ruled that as long as it was absolutely necessary, no power should be bought from Enron. The calculation was, it would be **cheaper to just pay Enron the mandatory fixed charges for the power plant which was legally binding than to actually buy and use the power produced from the plant.** The fixed charges was 1000 crore a year for phase 1 of the project. Phase 2 would have been nearly twice the size. 

13) January 2001 - MH govt - now with new Congress govt with new CM - announced it didn't have money to pay enron. [7]

14) 6th February, 2001 - Ten days after the earthquake in Gujarat, the country was reeling from the disaster. **Enron invoked the counter-guarantee that if govt didn't come up with cash, it be auctioning the govt properties pledged as collateral security in the contract.** [8] [9]

15) Enron and MH govt then entered into court battle, while then US ambassador, Richard Celeste, publicly chastised MH govt for not being able to pay Enron. [10]. BTW, Enron was President Bush's largest campaign donor. 

16) Five years later, This plant was taken over by Ratnagiri Gas and Power Private limited in July 2005.

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetheart_deal

[2] http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1011566556405983800 - **After presenting his credentials this summer, Ambassador Robert D. Blackwill wasted no time in warning the Indians that Enron's problems were at the top of the Bush administration's commercial agenda. ""I want to be frank,"" Mr. Blackwill told the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce and the Indo-American Society. ""These disputes have darkened India's investment climate.""**

[4] http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/10/business/enron-can-resume-big-indian-power-project.html - **Clearance by the national Government was the final hurdle for the stalled project 250 miles south of Bombay. Enron Development, a unit of the Enron Corporation of Houston, revised the project after the Maharashtra state government had canceled it last August. The renegotiated proposals for the plant were approved by Maharashtra authorities in January. But work at the site could not resume without fresh approval from New Delhi. ""Prime Minister Deve Gowda phoned the Chief Minister to say that the project has been cleared,"" Maharashtra's finance minister, Eknathrao Khadse, said.**

Why D.Subbarao was a far better RBI governor than R.Rajan.,12,2z7jxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2z7jxj/why_dsubbarao_was_a_far_better_rbi_governor_than/,4,1426517695.0,"I work in finance and everyone here was surprised by the rate cuts from the RBI. There is a clear belief Rajan wilted under pressure from the Modi government which was under pressure from an over leveraged corporate sector , and PSU banks showing worsening balance sheets.

Data clearly shows that inflation slowed down due to slowing production. Therefore any pickup in consumption (demand) in short term would lead to inflation. In fact the governor said the same thing that he is wary in the short term of inflation picking up.

Also most us believed that crude was oversold and the governor was too bearish in factoring in crude prices vis a vie future inflation.

I'm not even going to talk about the moral hazard about the revolving door between large corporations  and Modi.

http://www.firstpost.com/business/did-raghuram-rajan-cut-rates-too-early-imfs-inflation-warning-seems-to-suggest-so-2155713.html


On the other hand Subbarao for years stood against the constant pressure of rate cuts from the UPA. I think we underestimate how good he was and certainly a far better governor than Rajan.

This brilliant excerpt from Catch-22 captures what is happening in India right now.,0,5il51f,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5il51f/this_brilliant_excerpt_from_catch22_captures_what/,0,1481876081.0,"Set during WWII, this excerpt talks about a jealous Colonel Black setting up the  Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade to expose another character as a communist. 

When fellow administrative officers expressed astonishment at Colornel Cathcart’s choice of Major Major, Captain Black muttered that there was something funny going on. when they remarked that Major Major was somewhat odd, Captain Black announced that he was a Communist.

“They’re taking over everything,” he declared rebelliously. “Well, you fellows can stand around and let them if you want to, but I’m not going to. I’m going to do something about it. From now on I’m going to make every son of a bitch who comes to my intelligence tent sign a loyalty oath. And I’m not going to let that bastard Major Major sign one even if he wants to.”

Almost overnight the Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade was in full flower, and Captain Black was enraptured to discover himself spearheading it. He had really hit on something. All the enlisted men and officers on combat duty had to sign a loyalty oath to get their map cases from the intelligence tent, a second loyalty oath to receive their flak suits and parachutes from the parachute tent, a third loyalty oath for Lieutenant Balkington, the motor vehicle officer, to be allowed to ride from the squadron to the airfield in one of the trucks. Every time they turned around there was another loyalty oath to be signed. They signed a loyalty oath to get their pay from the finance officer, to obtain their PX supplies, to have their hair cut by the Italian barbers. To Captain Black, every officer who supported his Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade was a competitor, and he planned and plotted twenty-four hours a day to keep one step ahead. He would stand second to none in his devotion to country. When other officers had followed his urging and introduced loyalty oaths of their own, he went them one better by making every son of a bitch who came to his intelligence tent sign two loyalty oaths, then three, then four; then he introduced the pledge of allegiance, and after that “The Star-Spangled Banner,” one chorus, two choruses, three choruses, four choruses. Each time Captain Black forged ahead of his competitors, he swung upon them scornfully for their failure to follow his example. Each time they followed his example, he retreated with concern and racked his brain for some new stratagem that would enable him to turn upon them scornfully again.

Without realizing how it had come about, the combat men in the squadron discovered themselves dominated by the administrators appointed to serve them. They were bullied, insulted, harassed and shoved about all day long by one after the other. When they voiced objection, Captain Black replied that people who were loyal would not mind signing all the loyalty oaths they had to. To anyone who questioned the effectiveness of the loyalty oaths, he replied that people who really did owe allegiance to their country would be proud to pledge it as often as he forced them to. And to anyone who questioned the morality, he replied that “The Star-Spangled Banner” was the greatest piece of music ever composed. The more loyalty oaths a person signed, the more loyal he was; to Captain Black it was as simple as that, and he had Corporal Kolodny sign hundreds with his name each day so that he could always prove he was more loyal than anyone else.

“Of course, it’s up to you,” Captain Black pointed out. “Nobody’s trying to pressure you. But everyone else is making them sign loyalty oaths, and it’s going to look mighty funny to the F.B.I. if you are the only ones who don’t care enough about your country to sign loyalty oaths. If you want to get a bad reputation, that’s nobody’s business but your own. All we’re trying to do is help.”",6
Please help me decide,2,3f45dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3f45dj/please_help_me_decide/,6,1438254466.0,"Already posted in relationships but need some Indian prospective. 
Hello everyone. I am 28 years male and I have been married for 4 years now. I am from northern India from a small village. but I got married to Aussie girl who was 18 at time of marriage.My parents live in India while I am in Australia from 8 years. 
I am pouring my heart out please don't mind the Grammer or long post. 


 To start with it was very well. We got together love blossom she had bad childhood memories coz of divorce between her mum and dad and she never talked to her dad. she wanted to marry someone who would not leave her ever. I told about my cultures where marriages do last longer and since it was my 3rd gf and first serious one so we got married despite sharp reaction from her side and my family also worrying about society. However I told her that in 5 years  I do want to return back to India and settle permanently she agreed. We 2 didn't care about anyone got married  after few hiccups especially her father threaten to kill me and destroy the marriage.  she moved in she was 18 I was 24 at that time. I did got residency on basis of this relationship but i wasn't fooling or using her to get this thing. We did trip to India together with her mother and step father and friends in 2012  got married in big fat Indian wedding style. She loved the experience of India. We were happy things were great she started to learn cultures got job in Indian restaurant to have better understanding of India. My family love her and I m proud of her to this date

Problems started with I realising she was getting lazy when we came back after 1 month around this time period she wouldn't show much interest in cooking we were living in shared house I tool responility of financial aspect worked hard like most Indians do 6 days a week. I later find out she was going clubbing and meeting other guys while I was at work. She cheated on me that's what I feel when she hide things from me. I got upset but I wanted her and got carried away by tears and I saw from her view point that she is young and need adventure and teenage partying thing. I trusted her words and we moved to new place as I fought with my roommates regarding some other issues. I could only manage a old house which was close to my job although she wanted to move closer to her mum but due to 3 hours drive from my work every day we rejected the thought. 

In 2014 I got permanent residency we went to india again for my sisters marriage she was 6 months pregnant. This time also she enjoyed there getting loved by all my family and she is proud of my family we like to show her off and other people are jealous. 1month later on return I started missing my friends and family more. Tears in my mother's eyes and she wanting me not to leave have impact on me bit due to some financial issues I have to return. I had built a new house in the city. Had few investments and we wanted to run a business some day most likely bakery because my wife love to bake and or open a dance school some day. She did left school b4 wedding She wanted to be teacher I supported her and got her in college where she finished year 12.all this time I only worked so all financial department was mine. 

Her step father got diagnosed with parkisons disease in 2012 and in September 2014 she asked me it's better if she move to her mum so she could care her during pregnancy as it's closer to hospital and she can look after her step dad while mum works. I respected that and agreed. Now that's where problem started me working random shifts but agreed to see her every weekend. In between we had fights where I wanted her to move in with me and she used same excuse that she need to be there. 
In January she gave birth to beautiful daughter I was casual at work still I took 2 weeks off taking care of baby. After that she still stayed at mums didn't want to move in coz of unhygienic conditions in bathroom coz its old. 

I wanted to settle down but again she wanted house around her mother's side I got 6 days permanent job so I couldn't travel everyday from mum s house. We chose a land near my work and paid deposit. I worked whole night in morning she would visit once fortnight to go look at display houses There was issues with house designs and we resolved by adding what we both want. 

Now I wanted her to move in with me coz I can't travel every weekend either. And her step dad died. She always said she is staying away because of being caring him.  I was sharing house with two other guys and she isn't happy with condition of bathroom and cleanliness but mind u she never try to clean the house herself even her dishes and stuff I have to nag her and write a list so she could do which is what she used to do with her mum. She started to get depressed and went to psychologist regarding her step father passing grieving. She invited me too. Personally being raised in country where I haven't seen so much fuck given about these issues solved with help of psychologist. We went now I got big surprise she hardly told me this but in front of her psychologist she said she has been feeling small, useless and fat and ugly . she lost her friends after baby she is lonely and  Although she did gain lot of weight. Again I put few points in my defense and counter arguments like I m working my arse off while she is just spending while staying away from me. Then psychologist told us we need counselling which I didn't agree. I felt I did  sacrifices like she did too leaving friends and family for love to be together there are some cultural aspects which makes it harder in communicating what I meant and what she make of it. My jokes she doesn't find them funny. 



Fast forward in June she came over with promise she would stay permanent after I did some repairs to house but  stayed a week with baby then she had excuses that she booked appointments for baby and her driving lessons at mum s place so she want to go back. Despite my only hope that now we would stay together she wanted to go back again which pissed me off eneded up in fight she gone back. She has planned with her mum to go out long weekend on romantic place she wanted us to go and she would move in after this. I was very very excited so 4 of us our 6months baby me wife and her mom. She said she want me to forget everything and just make her feel happy for these two days. I didn't knew what was coming we hardly ever talked as she hinted me we could talk her moving with me after trip which was like no in my head. So whole mood was off during this trip. On last day she told me with 😢 tears that she won't be moving ever and she is breaking up with me. I expected her saying no to moving but breakup was big thing. Although in past I have said so many times to her to breakup while in anger and she would cry to that but I forget after fights and treated like it's normal. I m realising now how big of fool I was. 

She is changed now totally switched off no feelings for me she want me to visit see daughter once a week or have relationship with daughter only not her. My heart is bleeding I am feeling suicidal. Can't talk with my friends about this in detail not with my parents either. I am realising now I have not lived up to mark as husband and I should have listened and done things but finances and responsibilities of sisters marriage and other stuff put lot off stress on me. I have been depressed for ages. She is agreed to marriage counselling which is in two weeks. Her birthday is on 31st  I want to surprise her and see her while she visit her friends she doesn't want anything b4 counselling. I am agreed to move into new house although it's just 12months when our house will be ready. Ready to change shifts from night to Morning. 


So my issue now is I am confused 
I wasn't  a better husband now option is to be better father like she wants me to but without her in my life which I don't want to do. I want either whole family of us together or nothing 
Or to be better son cancel the land deal don't take huge loan and spend my life paying it off  and  I want to move to India some day she said she doesn't know if she will now. Also her mum and sister putting words in her ears and making her against me. 

I want to repair my mistakes show her that I do care and love her the way she wants. I fear our relationship will. Never be the same and she would always give me threats of I ever did or expect even normal things like food while I come from work or other expectations of she taking care of herself. now at this stage I need to be clear in one direction not to get confused or hanging between India and Australia or parents and friends or wife and kid. I would be much better if this would get clear. Please give some advice or thought as I don't have western thinking experience. I am trying to change myself to be better person.

"The budget making season is here again. the usual beggars from Industry and Trade, well represented by CI, FICCI and Assocham are out",14,28c4nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28c4nt/the_budget_making_season_is_here_again_the_usual/,4,1403002042.0,"The budget making season is here again. the usual beggars from Industry and Trade, well represented by CI, FICCI and Assocham are, out in front of North Block with their palms stuck out for alms.

Budget Priorities. Collect more and give less alms.

Mohan Guruswamy

Stripped of all the verbiage the main function of a government is to collect taxes. To do so effectively and successfully it must preserve order and stability; and ensure conditions to keep the economy growing. The more it grows the more revenues it collects and therefore how much it collects is the truest index of its success. The power of a nation is directly related to the revenues it realizes from its citizens. The United States is powerful because it collects almost $8800 per capita from its citizens. Those who predict the imminent rise of China and then India to the rarefied heights of being a global power do not seem to realize that China collects only $390 per capita and India only $110 per capita. I have particularly in mind one official in the Ministry of Finance who goes from meeting to meeting with a PowerPoint presentation of in a few years India will be a world power in a few decades giving rise to much self delusional optimism among the national elite. There is no doubt that the GDP’s of China and India will close in on that of the USA within the next three or four decades. But we will still be nowhere near the USA when it comes to that raw index of true power. How much money does the State have to spend?

A State has four main streams of collecting taxes. These are corporate and personal income taxes; and customs and excise duties. Every year as the budget proposals for the next year are being written there is a general clamor from Trade and Industry bodies like the CII, FICCI and Assocham pleading for a reduction of the rates of all these. While they package their pleas with what purports to be sound economic logic, the real logic is just that the fat cats want to get still fatter.

Of course taxes ought to be reasonable and balanced to give the State more money to spend without imposing a back breaking burden on its private and corporate citizens. To find this reason and fine balance is what good government is all about. Too high an incidence of taxation will not only encourage cheating on taxes but will make industry and commerce unprofitable and dis-incentivize individuals. There was a time in this country when personal income tax was as high as 98% for the highest slab. The consequence was that there were few honest people at the higher slabs. Cheating the State became a common practice. With the rates now much more sensible this is not so common. Ditto for customs and excise duties. The only outcome of the extortionate rate of taxes we used to have only a few decades ago is still seen in the continuing incidence of corruption in the tax collecting departments of the government. It is no wonder then that an IRS son-in-law is still a prize catch for many a family!

But are taxes still too high in India? Let’s take corporate taxes. The USA and Japan top the list with 40% and 40.69% respectively. Germany collects 38.36%, Italy 37.25% and Canada 36.10%. Among the G-20 countries only China imposes a smaller percentage than India. China’s rate is a flat 33% and India’s is 33.99%. China’s rate has been steady at 33% for the past five years while India’s has declined by almost 2%. As a matter of fact only India among the G-20 has been steadily reducing the incidence of corporate taxation. Despite this uncollected taxes are on the rise.
The government could have been richer by a gargantuan Rs.5.8 lakh crore if the IT department had not been dragging its feet over recovering the amount in time or holding up files in appeal cases at the Commissioner of Income Tax level. Another Rs.2.1 lakh crore that is stuck in litigation cases at the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, high courts and the Supreme Court. The total figure is now over Rs.8 lakh crore.
These figures have been highlighted in the latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) tabled in Parliament. The report points out a tax demand for Rs.2.9 lakh crore remained uncollected at the end of March 31, 2011. ""The recovery mechanism is inefficient as certified demand remaining uncollected increased to Rs.1,06,990 crore (96.3 per cent) in 2010-11 from 26,703 crore (75.8 per cent) in 2006-07,"" the report adds.

Quite clearly this has more to do with the usual bad habits and bad government than high taxation? Meanwhile in the case of the USA the average corporate tax rate had risen by as high as 6%. Fighting two wars can be an expensive business. But so can modernizing a nation and fighting poverty by creating 12 million jobs a year.

In the details provided by Mr. Chidambaram in last years budget proposals is another gem. The effective tax rate for Public Sector companies was 23.35% while that of the Private Sector that CII and FICCI champion was just 19.50%. The IT sector has become the bellwether of Indian enterprise. The IT majors have been performing exceptionally not just in the stock market but also in the real world. They have been posting income gains and rising profits year after year. One would have thought that the self professedly socially conscious leaders of this sector would have given the State, which has also got to cater to hundreds of millions of people living well below an acceptable living standard, something for giving them large catchment area of math proficiency. On the other hand the IT sector took away Rs. 11,880 crores as deduction on export profits. The telecom sector is adding almost 12 million new subscribers each month now. It took Rs.6850 crores in exemption. And these are the sunrise sectors. I dread to imagine what the new day is going to be like then?

But what must cause the MoF even more concern is that China’s government revenues have been growing by almost 17% each year since 1998. And India’s has been growing relatively slowly at 12% in comparison. It’s true that their GDP has been growing faster than ours. But it is also true that they collect more taxes and give far lesser write-offs.

Nani Palkhivala's India {Short read} [NP],3,3qjta7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3qjta7/nani_palkhivalas_india_short_read_np/,1,1446062736.0,"Those of us who have lived through the earlier days of free India, when the entire nation as looking forward with zeal and fervour and with a sense of national pride, cannot but look upon the present times with deep anguish and distress. I do not think India in its entire history of 5,000 years has ever reached a lower level of degradation than it has reached now. The depth of decadence to which we have sunk was exemplified by the leakage of question papers for the Joint Entrance Examination 1997 for the first time in the history of the Indian Institute of Technology.
The only achievement of Indian democracy has been that it has survived unfractured for fifty years. Nine hundred fifty million people — more than the combined population of Africa and South America — live together as one political entity under conditions of freedom. Never before in history, and nowhere else in the world today, has one-sixth of the human race existed as a single free nation. Professor Rostow of Texas University regards the survival of Indian democracy as the most important phenomenon of the post-war era.

The achievement is all the more creditable, since no other democracy has had such diversity in unity, or was such a mosaic of humanity. All the great religions in the world have flourished in India. We have 15 major languages written in different alphabets and derived from different roots; and, for good measure, our people — whom you can never call taciturn — express themselves in 250 dialects.
The English language, which is not included in the 15 major languages listed in the Constitution, yet continues to be the only link language for the whole country; it is the only tongue in which the South is prepared to communicate with the North.
In 1950, we started as a Republic with inestimable advantages.
First, we had 5,000 years of civilisation behind us — a civilisation which had reached ‘the summit of human thought’ in the word of Ralph Waldo Emerson. We inherited great skills and many-splendoured intelligence, since the genes had evolved over five luminous millenia. We had a superb entrepreneurial spirit, honed over a century of obstacles. A few years ago, a World Bank report on India mentioned two very favourable factors — an unlimited reservoir of skilled labour, and abundance of capital available for investment in new projects. The trader’s instinct is innate in Indian genes. An Indian can buy from a Jew and sell to a Scot, and yet make a profit!

Secondly, whereas before 1858 India was never a united political entity, in that year the accident of British rule welded us into one country, one nation; and when Independence came, we had been in unified nationality for almost a century under one head of state.

Thirdly, our founding fathers, after two long years of laborious and painful toil, gave us a Constitution which a former Chief Justice of India rightly described as “sublime”.
The substance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations on December 10, 1948, is embodied as Fundamental Rights in our Constitution. The right to equality before the law is guaranteed to citizens and non-citizen alike. All religions are treated with equal tolerance and equal reverence. The religion of a citizen is no bar to his holding any office, however exalted, in politics or the judiciary. In this respect, we are more secular than the United Kingdom where a Roman Catholic cannot be the monarch or the lord chancellor.
In another respect, our Constitution may claim to be more progressive than that of the United States of America. Equality of the sexes is a guaranteed right in India, whereas the attempt to incorporate a similar right in the United States Constitution was met with resistance.

We can proudly say that our Constitution gave us a flying start and equipped us adequately to meet the challenges of the future. Unfortunately, over the years we dissipated every advantage we started with, like a compulsive gambler bent upon squandering an invaluable legacy. I am afraid, India today is only a caricature of the noble democracy which our forefathers strove to bring to life and freedom in 1947.

As early as January 1987, The Economist rightly remarked that socialism as practised in India has been a fraud. Our brand of socialism did not result in transfer of wealth from the rich to the poor but only from the honest rich to the dishonest rich.
We built up state-owned enterprises called the public sector in India. The sleeping sickness of socialism is now universally acknowledged, — but not officially in India. More than 240 public sector enterprises are run by the Union government, and more than 700 by the state governments. These public sector enterprises are the black holes, the money guzzlers, and they have been extracting an exorbitant price for India’s doctrinaire socialism.

There is a tidal wave of privatisation sweeping across the world from Bangladesh to Brazil, but it has turned aside in its course and passed India by.

The most persistent tendency in India has been to have too much government and too little administration; too many laws and too little justice; too many public servants and too little public service; too many controls and too little welfare.
My own thinking is that our greatest initial mistake was to start with adult franchise. No democracy has ever paid, all things considered, a heavier price for adult franchise than India. I am not aware of any great democracy which started as a republic on the basis of adult franchise: all of them started with a more restricted system and then graduated to adult franchise. When the Constituent Assembly was in session, two of our greatest statesmen — C Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel — recommended that we should not start with adult franchise but educate our people first to make them worthy of discharging their duties as citizens of a great democracy; but they were out-voted.

The second fatal mistake was to let the population nearly treble, in the absence of any sensible or sound family planning measures and policies. Today, the unbridled population growth, except in the state of Kerala, has been the ruin of this country.
Our third disastrous mistake was to pay no attention to education. Value-based education has never any sex appeal in Indian politics. Unlike Lee Kuan Yew who gave education the priority of priorities in Singapore, our political parties treated literacy as a matter of no consequence. The result has been that more than half of our population is literally illiterate. Official statistics give a more comforting figure; but that is only because any person who can write or sign his name is considered to be literate according to official statistics.

Professor Amartya Sen has bluntly said India will be the only country in the world to enter the 21st century with half her population illiterate, and that successive state governments have demonstrated “incredible irresponsibility” with regard to primary education. In total disregard of Article 45 of the Constitution, state governments have completely ignored their obligation to provide compulsory primary education.

When I was in the United States, I was often asked one question — How does India, with its great human potential and natural resources, manage to remain poor? The correct answer is very unflattering and hardly the type of answer which an ambassador of any country may be expected to give: We are not poor by nature but poor by policy. You would not be far wrong if you called India the world’s leading expert in the art of perpetuating poverty.

Yes, the potential of India is so great! Sir William Ryrie, the executive vice -president of the International Finance Corporation, expressed the view that India has some of “the most creative entrepreneurs . . . The most dynamic business leaders, and the sharpest financial brains in the world.” These words give you an idea of the magnitude of the effort needed to keep India impoverished.

Most of our politicians and bureaucrats, untainted by knowledge of development in the outside world, have no desire to search for genes of ideas which deserve to be called “a high-yielding variety of economics”. We are smugly reconciled to low yield from high ideals.

India is rattling — and rattling violently with spare human capacity. More than thirty million are registered on our 891 employment exchanges. According to objective estimates, there must be at least thirty million more who are unemployed, but who are not registered.

As the chancellor of the exchequer pointed out in the House of Commons some time ago, the population of Hong Kong is less than one per cent of India’s (0.7 per cent to be precise) and its land area is 0.03 per cent of India’s and yet it has twice the trade of India.

The picture that emerges is that of a great nation in a state of moral decay, of which corruption and indiscipline are two of the several facets. In the land of Mahatma Gandhi, violence is on the throne today. Mobocracy has too often displaced democracy. The contribution of modern India to sociology has been a Bandh — the closure of an entire city by militant rowdies.

One may apply to India the words used by the late Benigno Aquino about the Philippines — “Here is a land in which a few are spectacularly rich while the masses remain abjectly poor, where freedom and its blessings are a reality for a minority and an illusion for the many, a land consecrated to democracy but is a land of privilege and rank, a republic educated to equality but mired in an archaic system of caste.”

The greatest problem of India is that its finest men — men of calibre and vision, knowledge and character — are not in politics and stand little chance of getting elected, having regard to the murky atmosphere of our political life. I was one of the foolish people who told Hari Nanda to stand for Parliament. He stood for Parliament from the seat which was supposed to be the safest for him — Faridabad. He was not only defeated, but he forfeited his deposit!

If I am asked to name one curse which deserves to be regarded as the greatest curse of India, I would say it is casteism.

Unfortunately, divisiveness has become the Indian disease. Truly, divisiveness is the AIDS of India — a disease which is spreading fast and wide, preys on the public mind and is without a cure in sight. Communal hatred, linguistic fanaticism, regional fealty, and caste loyalty are gnawing at the vitals of the unity and integrity of the country. To the growing army of terrorists and professional hooligans, caste or clan, creed or tongue, is a sufficient ground to kill their fellow citizens.

National integration is born in the hearts of the citizens. When it dies there, no army, no government can save it. Inter-faith harmony and consciousness of the essential unity of all religions is the very heart of our national integration.

The soul of India aspires to integration and assimilation. Down the ages, Indian culture — a tremendous force of power and beauty — has been made richer and deeper as a result of absorbing what is best in outside influences and integrating those various influences to grace and enrich its own identity.
Yet, an objective overview would justify confidence in the long-term future of the country. A nation’s worth is not measured by its gross national product any more than an individual’s worth is measured by his bank account. Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith remarked that while he had seen poverty in many countries of the world, he found one unusual attribute among the poor of India — “There is richness is their poverty.”

Hundreds of millions, who have no standard of living, still have a standard of life. The ancient civilisation has survived and will survive when the raucous and fractious voices of today are lost in the silence of the centuries.

Nature has been kind to India in one respect. It has endowed the country with the gift of producing great leaders in the darkest hour — leaders with the gift of grace who can arouse the trusting millions to lofty heights.

I believe the solution for India is not to be found in adult franchise. There is a basic lesson of Indian history. Our people have always taken their moral standards from their rulers; the people have risen to great heights when they have basked in the glow of noble kings or leaders. The present generation is waiting for a leader who will make it relearn the moral values, and who will inculcate in the people as Gandhiji did, a sense of the responsibilities which fall on every citizen of a free society.
It is true that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. But it is true, in even a deeper sense, that eternal responsibility is also part of the price of liberty. Excessive authority, without liberty, is intolerable; but excessive liberty, without authority and without responsibility, soon becomes equally intolerable.

De Tocqueville made the profound observation that liberty cannot stand alone but must be paired with a companion virtue: liberty and morality; liberty and law; liberty and justice; liberty and the common good; liberty and civic responsibility.
One last thought, and I shall have done. Today, the unity and integrity of India seems to be at stake. But “even this shall pass away”. Indian society will, in course of time, acquire the requisite political culture — the attitudes and habits of tolerance, mutual respect and goodwill, which alone can make democracy workable.
The day will come when the 26 states of India will realise that in a profound sense they are culturally akin, ethnically identical, linguistically knit and historically related.

The major task before India today is to acquire a keener sense of national identity, to gain the wisdom to cherish its priceless heritage, and to create a cohesive society with the cement of Indian culture. We shall then celebrate our Republic as the dependence of the states upon one another, the dependence of our numerous communities upon one another, the dependence of the many castes and clans upon one another — in the sure knowledge that we are one nation.

[R] Goods and Services Tax,19,2ftrrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2ftrrf/r_goods_and_services_tax/,0,1410227590.0,"Original date of rollout: April 1, 2010

Contentious issues:

1)

* States: Demand for provision in constitution to compensate them for any losses they make under proposed tax regime.

* Reason: Past bad experience of compensation in central sales tax (cst) case.

* Cst case - UPA government said that compensation to states on account of cut in cst to be released only when states agree to rollout gst. 

* Outcome - NDA said dues of Rs. 34,000 crore to be given to state over period of 3 years.
* Problem: compensation is proposed for only 5 years. ""the constitution cannot be changed every now and then"". Besides, NDA confident that states would not make any loss under the gst as they would get to share revenue.

* Solution: Use of alternative legal framework that does not involve constitutional amendment. Possible that 14th finance commission may recommend mechanism.

2)

* States: Petroleum product to be kept out of gst.

* Reason: It comprises 26% of their revenue.

* Problem: a) It forms major input for all other industries. 

* b) Will result in cascading of taxes for all other sectors, increase in cost of production. 

* c) It will disrupt audit trail and cause revenue leakages.

* Solution: a) Include petroleum in gst but tax at rate of 0%.
* b) States continue to levy sales tax, value added tax on it.
* c) Centre retains right to impose excise duty.

3)

* States: Entry tax to be kept out of gst.
 
* Problem: a) Excluding so many taxes from gst will defeat purpose of making India a common market.

* b) Pushes up the revenue-neutral rate for government.

* Solution: States could levy additional state gst - within a band - to protect revenue.

2014 Elections & the case of Most Common Travel Agency Ever,0,22lc3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/22lc3b/2014_elections_the_case_of_most_common_travel/,1,1397059772.0,"note - the author of this article has full intentions of bein recognized by fiat, or, atleast, ambassador foundation. and get some grant to start an n.g.o.

In the city of timbaktu, during summers, a new travel agent announced the best summer holiday tour package ever. He promised best food, stay at top hotel property in the town, with world class services, complete sight seeing, free vehicle service, some surprise deals only for timbaktu people, with no extra or hidden charges. Adding to the glamour, all this with service tax waived off. 

As in any other city, timbaktu also had enough number of people, who were fed up of below average cheap deals provided by other travel agents, without realizing, that it was more about hotels not being able to manage big uneducated, indisciplined crowds at cheap rates, and not about quality of hotel staff alone. Not to forget, hotel staff was from timbaktu only. Moreover, our new agent, calling himself, ""The most common travel agency ever"", had declared that while all other travel agencies had secret deals with hotel owners, he had no such arrangements, and so, by saving on commissions, he will give them better services at half the rates, eventhough hotel owners had not reduced their rates.

So, that year, ""The most common travel agency ever"" had a vey good business, they managed to break record of getting highest sales figure in the opening year of any business. Looking at its success, to save their credit in the market, other agencies that had poor sales figures, decided to shift their customers to the new agency. So, in the end, ""The most common travel agency ever"" managed to become hotel property's most preferred and top priority agency, and so, the new agency, who had booked maximum number of rooms, became decision maker of the hotel property. According to hotel's rule book, that entire summer, hotel will be managed by ""The most common travel agency ever"", and they will be reponsible for operations of the hotel, profits and loss.

Now that ""the most common travel agency ever"" was on the management seat of hotel property, it was in their hands to provide all that they had promised. The only difference now was that they had to manage finance and economics of that hotel too, alongwith their guests - the people of timbaktu. As promised, they declared change in hotel tariffs and menu prices of restaurants, even increased number of free services provided by the hotel. They even used satyagrah weapons when hotel owners tried to use their veto power through security staff. Here, it is worth to mention that security staff of hotel was kept in the hands of hotel owners, because, this particular hotel was in the most sensitive zones of the area. And hotel owners did not want to play with security of property while trying to promote democratic way of management, where, customer with highest numbers of room booked, has a say in hotel management.

However, during those satyagrah days, guests from timbaktu faced many problems, but they thought it was for their good only, and, so, ignored.

Then one day, suddenly, ""The most common travel agency ever"" declared that there was a dispute betwin, hotel owners and the representatives of ""most common travel agency ever"" - who were on management seat. Suddenly, they decided to resign and leave from the position of hotel's management. According to hotel owners, they only had asked ""The most common travel agency ever"" to follow hotel processes, to ensure no glitch in service delivery to guests. After resigning, hotel owners rolled back all free services and tariff cuts.

People of timbaktu, who had come on tour with ""The most common travel agency ever"" to enjoy their vacations, were now at the helm of hotel owner - the same hotel owner that was declared as ""corrrupt agent"" by ""The most common travel agency ever"". somehow, they managed to spend their time till the tour package deal ended, thinking, however bad hotel services are, they are atleast there to give services. people of timbaktu came back from summer tour safely somehow. Not to forget, ending up paying more then they had agreed.

There was no news of ""The most common travel agency ever"" till winters. However, during winters, there was news around the town, that ""The most common travel agency ever"" had started their branch in honolulu, which was a much bigger town, and promised 10 times more sales then timbaktu. there was also news that in honolulu, they had unearthed more ""secret deals betwin hotels and travel agents"". somehow, ""The most common travel agency ever"" had managed to maintain their honest image. However, according to industry analysts, it was not by giving good deals, but by showing corrupt side of other travel agents. Worth mentioning here for the reader, it was heard that industry analysts were also in secret deal with hotel owners.

By next summers, ""The most common travel agency ever"" had branches across the continent. So, they thought it to be safe enough to come back to timbaktu. afterall, timbaktu was their launchpad.

However, in timbaktu, someone, still not able to forget how they were left alone, hangin in the middle of corrupt agents, managed to slap the owner of ""the most common travel agency ever"". He was heard shouting ""I know what you did last summer"" repeatedly, which was ignored by onlookers, as most of the onlookers were deaf, which was a coincidence, and considered to be natures way of balancing the existence of someone silent since last 10 summers.

Fearing to loose their credibility, industry analysts declared that the one who slapped the epitome of honesty was paid agent of corrupt hotel owners. However, for the owners of ""The most common travel agency ever"", this is a good chance to prove that people of timbaktu are not well behaved, and that was the reason for failure of that deal.

Meanwhile,
1. There is no effect on the business of hotel owners, as all travel agencies, new or old, are dependat on an economy that is highly affected by business of hotel owners. Not to forget, travel agencies, being middlemen, can at most, negotiate freebies for guests, but can not, and dare not, build and run hotels.
2. Timbaktu, and people around other cities in the continent, have considerble amount of people who believe that it is possible to force hotel owners to make a deal where hotels will be managed at loss. And that for timbaktu's existence hotel owners are inconsequential. Amount of such people is good enough for the new party to continue in future for long.
3. Some hotel owners, who are given certificates of honesty for taking no commissions have joined the new travel agency. To accomodate them, they have renamed it to, ""The most common travel agency ever pvt. Ltd.""

We really need to talk about Flairs.,104,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,1494883276.0,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",7
Automation In Our Society,10,c8d03b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c8d03b/automation_in_our_society/,7,1562121722.0,"
One word has become synonymous with the current economy and job market, that's automation. Automation has been happening all around us for years, but the pace of it has increased substantially in recent times. We are staring at highly automated work environments where the need for people has become inefficient, automation has crept up slowly across industries and has become a major threat to future economies of countries. The problem is, that there hasn't been a concrete solution, no one seems to be agreeing on what could be the solution to this. 


Automation, in manufacturing industry has been constantly increasing, the coveted assembly line model by Henry Ford that streamlined the manufacturing process by making it efficient has in these modern times been a reason for automation to take over jobs. A decade or two ago you could see people working in assembly line, but now if you go to any manufacturing plant there is a high chance that you'll be seeing people only doing quality inspection on the assembly lines instead of doing any assembly, that's because all of it is being done by Robots that have gotten so efficient and cost effective in the long run that there is no reason to have people assembling it. 


Look at the IT sector for an example a decade ago when you dialled a customer support of a company there would be people picking up your phone and addressing you concern or complaints but now when you call customer support of a company, it's a jumbled mess of pre recorded options that you press, if you are lucky and have pressed the right options for a couple of times you might get lucky and actually have a person who might address your problem. Now think about both of these examples, the expertise required for assembling has been replaced by inspection of assembled stuff, which requires much less technical knowledge and experience. Same goes for the IT sector, now a couple of hundred of people can handle a country's customer support because of pre recorded options. This has obviously helped in increasing productivity in both industries and has made it easier and efficient process.


There have been people who have dismissed the buzz words of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning), but software tools powered by AI and ML have been able to make a dent in management industry as well. For some time automation has only affected the workers or the labour intensive tasks, but AI powered software has made many management position redundant. In the service industry, you can already see bigger retailers, either going online or having less and less number of people employed in their stores, with the high penetration of internet, now payments have become increasingly cashless and you can see stores with self checkout counters in the west. You shouldnt be surprised if in the future you enter a mall early morning to get your groceries and you end up being the only person in the whole mall, since every task now has been automated. 


The major industry that is yet to be affected by this onslaught of automation has been driving, the goods carriers, the taxi drivers and truck drivers, the delivery guy who delivers your Amazon orders or the Swiggy guy who delivers you your food. There is a big chance that over the decade you might see all of them disappear, with self driving cars and trucks, drone delivery for goods becoming a reality, the industry will move quickly and make all of these automated. Atleast, now you can take that extra nap you need in your self driving car when you head out to work or eat your breakfast in it. 


Imagining all of this, must give people a sense of comfort, on how the future will be becoming more convenient, but the fact is that it would come at cost of hundreds of thousands of jobs. While, it is true that newer jobs will be created, there is no doubt that it will never be as many as automation will be replacing. There have been solutions to these suggested such as robot tax which is taxing a company more for more automation, or solutions such as Universal Basic Income which addresses the post automation world where jobs are less and people need to be subsidised for living. While not working does seem like an absurd option, maybe it actually isn't, hobbies can become lifestyle choices, more people can go into sports, with the space exploration in the horizon maybe we can go back to exploration, while this will obviously guarantee that capitalism will make the balance of society uneven where we will have the ultra rich that will have majority of the wealth distributed among a single percent of the population, it will be the job of the future governments, economists and leaders to address these problems.

Note: I made a post about content writing and got a bit of PMs regarding samples, so I just made a Reddit post about it. I'd appreciate your advice and suggestions.

Whats the point of this continued existence?,136,af9uuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/af9uuv/whats_the_point_of_this_continued_existence/,75,1547344991.0,"26, Obese, no job, ""namesake"" education, no skills, no money

no friends, never been in relationship, i have tried but could never make friends, couldn't relate to anyone or anything, still tried to hang around but got told to fuck off explicitly, this happened multiple times before i gave up.

no talent, no hobbies, no interests, no passions, neither book smart, nor street smart. No discernible qualities...

have no meaningful relationships to anyone including parents, but even they have made it clear that they aren't very fond of me. They would've kicked me out a long time ago if not for keeping up social appearances, but they've made it clear that their tolerance is limiting.

Never had a drink, Never smoked, Never had any habits, Never watched enough movies, Didn't play much sports, most of my lifetime has been passed just sitting emptily...

Have somehow managed to get dealt every bad genetics card, yet have no disease to blame them for..

Fugly looking... I know, its not how you  look but... I've tried to dress well, groom well, put up a positive attitude... and got shut down pretty quickly... yeah definitely the face is a problem. You know how people say punchable faces, i have it (as i said every bad genetic traits that can't be blamed on some disease/disorder.. I have it). Pretty sure got shut out of few job interviews just by my looks.

Can't get a company job, not smart enough to get jobs through exams, blocked by my own fatness out of physical jobs. My own degree has become a hurdle as people reject me out of low end jobs purely out of suspicion that i might quit. -_-

Never had a meaningful conversation with another human being before, never had any pets... So... no meaningful connection with another living being...

I did try to run away thinking of restarting, a few years back... only to realize how fucking clueless i was, i did ask around few random shops and hotels for job, they took one look at me and told me to fuck off, realized that even poor people are well connected among themselves and its pretty much impossible for some one like me to find work... returned to parents in shame. I know there are lot of people in worse situations, but i clearly lack survivability. So...

(I have no clue how people just move to new places and make a living...)

I would've liked to think i had some mental issues, but pretty much sure i'm just stupid as fuck. From the last couple of years i seem to have lost it, because i'm now unable to stand and talk to another person as my heart starts racing so fast, some times feels like i'm having a heart attack just by being around others (This also have become a problem for me, because i can't tell if i'm having a real heart attack from my obesity or it's just the fear of talking to others). My hands literally start shaking just answering even marketing phone calls, i can't utter a complete sentence at another person before my mouth runs dry and words get stuck in my throat... So i just run away and hide or try to avoid any conversation altogether.

I used to think i was good at programming and technology, only to realize i knew fuck all as i studied further, add some unpleasant experiences surrounding that which i don't even want to recall, it pretty much broke me down, from last few months i have stopped applying, i have sopped trying. This has gotten so bad that even when i said fuck it  let me just give it another go, i am unable to do it.. like physically unable.. you know how people struggle while being mind controlled but ultimately give in and fail, its a feeling like that, i have literally tried to use my hands to push my own leg out the door and something within myself was disallowing me to go through with that. So, I gave up  and have shut myself in.

There is a constant looming thought of just offing myself and spare everyone the hassle of standing me, but i'm positively affirmative that i don't have the courage for it.

I mean i'm not sure why i am putting it all up, probably because i have only a few days left before i even run out of internet, my folks have even decided to move (yeah i never had a permanent address either which is making things a bit more complex). I am already not able to get a living in a big city, pretty sure i will have absolutely jack shit if i follow them to the small town (even they, are clear about not wanting me to come with them). I mean if i were to believe in every movie i've watched and every story i've read, you don't go move to a small town to get things done, that move is pretty much reserved for getting away from things. Since, I need things to gravitate towards, i shouldn't move.. right??

So basically, never did anything, never connected with anyone, Never traveled anywhere, Have nothing to look forward to, Have no motivation to do anything, Everything seems pointless... whats the point of just being without any purpose or direction? Or no resource to fill the void of having no purpose or direction? 
Is such a life even worth living? Am i worth existing??

FUCK!!

___________________________________________________
So,... I kindah have decided to make myself a purpose, thought i should start with improving my body first, but i can't afford gym membership (because that's the fastest way i could think of... i know i could just walk and jog for free, but those things takes years and i don't have years to spare). I am willing to work for it, is there anyway i can get something that will be able to pay for the following things?

A safe place to stay/sleep  .

Food to eat.

a gym membership

phone/internet

Commuting

spare money for getting clothes and stuff ( i don't have much to begin with, if i take working out seriously, i probably gonna need them).

I am willing to go anywhere as long as these things can be afforded from what i make at where i will be (or you don't have to pay me anything if you can provide me these things in exchange for the work).

I  can understand English, Hindi and kannada.

I AM good with computers than the average person though... if that matters, and probably the only thing i can be sure of with all the self-confidence i have left.

____________________________________________________

I don't know if i'm gonna come across as an entitled narcissistic cunt in this...

FUCK IT, I'm gonna post this... Here goes nothing!

I Cut the Cable,111,a7kj7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a7kj7t/i_cut_the_cable/,84,1545236295.0,"I recently cut the cable because prices of dth plans and now the individual channel prices, the prices for dth were totally unnecessary especially the extra they charged for HD channels, and i can count the channels on my hand that i see, so having unnecessary channels just for the sake of it was a wasteof money, so got a fire stick.

Use Hotstar for India Today, Aaj Tak and Republic TV. (Free btw you dot need to buy subscription for this)

Use NDTV's own app for NDTV 24x7 and NDTV India
(Free)

Use the News 18 app for CNN News 18 and News 18 India. (Free)

I have a Jio Connection so i have side loaded the Jio TV app and use it to watch Comedy Central HD, HBO HD, VH1 HD, CNN and French 24. 
The recent Ind Vs WI series was showcased on Jio's own stream channel Jio Cricket in HD and the Ind Vs Aus Test series can be seen in Sony Six HD. 

For content though i have Prime Video and Youtube for the channels i have subscribed to. 

I have a 1000GB data (main reason why i cut my cable) so streaming all of this usually uses about 200-250 GB a month. Also i dont pay any money for any subscription except Prime, i get the jio apps with my jio connection. This made me cut my cable 4 months ago, im pretty content. If anyone asked me is suggest them to cut the cable.

Edit: I am eventually going to get hotstar and netflix subscription, in terms of cost for a single tv it used to cost me Rs.300 a month for all SD channels, now its basically my jio connection and wifi (which i was gonna be paying for anyway so i wont include them) other than this, even if i get subscriptions it'll cost me Rs.1500/year for hotstar+prime with which i get music, movies and books from prime, also alexa smart home as i have a couple of smart bulbs. You might aswell include the price of my Jio Sim which is about Rs.1800/year, i would still save Rs.200 yearly. Pretty much everything is sorted except Netflix which i was thinking of getting but they are cancelling all the marvel shows and costs a lot, still not putting money into their pockets, i may share an account though.

[NP] Choosing TV channels has become very confusing so I'm seeking your help. Please help me understand what will be cheaper.,13,apjqd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/apjqd7/np_choosing_tv_channels_has_become_very_confusing/,9,1549941030.0,"My chief interests are cricket, documentaries, food and lifestyle channels. I want to be able to watch Cricket world cup, IPL, matches featuring India, and other series featuring good teams such as Ashes.

Some channels like **NHK Japan is being offered for free on my connection, but on others it's like 1800 rupees**...so I'm also confused **whether channels have different prices as per the service provider**.

“I get to see very less of sunlight for the most part of the year. Need to rise very early and by 7 a.m I join my abba (father). I help him in making carpets. Our room is very small and it gets difficult for both of us to fit in. Mostly, it remains dark as there is only one window for the light to come in. Carpets are not easy to make. It takes us around 12 hours every day and I hardly get a sense of time. My eyes hurt and the back aches a lot. Sometimes I hear my friends playing outside. I feel such an urge to join them. But it never happens. We are very poor and if I do not make carpets with Abba, we will not be able to have food on our plates. My studies have also stopped. I used to love going to school as I had so my friends there. But had to drop out after the second standard because my parents were not able to afford my education any further.”


As shared by 13-year-old Sahil from Budgam, Kashmir







**I. STATE OF EDUCATION IN JAMMU & KASHMIR**



**One of the unseen causality of militancy in the state of Jammu & Kashmir has been the education sector.** Children are thus one of the most affected cohorts, vulnerable to the impact of these conflicts with breakdown of families and loss of social protection system.



There are innumerable evidences that flag the dire state of education in the state of Jammu & Kashmir.



**1. The state of Jammu & Kashmir has 6th lowest state-wise literacy rate in India at 68.74% which is 5.30 percentage points below national average at 74.04%.**


[Comparison of Literacy Rates of Top 5 States, BIMARU States, and Jammu & Kashmir (2011 Census)!](https://imgur.com/2albrpG)


Thus, the literacy rate of the state of Jammu & Kashmir is not only below national average, but is comparable to literacy rates of BIMARU states.


**2. Net Enrolment Ratio (N.E.R.) has also consistently been below not only the national average but also that of BIMARU states.**


[N.E.R. of BIMARU states and Jammu & Kashmir!](https://imgur.com/DVQtV4e)


**3. The state also fares very poorly on other performance indicators such as percentage of schools having computers or access to electricity.**

**II. WHO ARE WE AND WHAT DO WE DO?**


Child Rights and You commonly abbreviated as CRY (https://www.cry.org), is a non-profit organisation in India, which aims to restore children's rights. CRY works to uplift thousands of underprivileged Indian children denied of basic rights by working across levels - from direct action, advocacy, mobilising public opinion to policy change.

Our Impact:

* Among 3,35,000 school going children, 9600 children who dropped out, between 6 and 18 years were re enrolled.
* We helped set up 13 new schools and facilitated the upgrade of 30 existing schools from primary to higher levels.
* We ensured that 33,000 children were immunized within their 1st year.
* We identified 21,600 children with varying degrees of malnutrition, 7000 among them were identified as severely malnourished (SAM) and were brought under the safety net.
* **Over the last 30 years, we impacted the lives of more than 20,00,000 children across 20 states in India.**

**III. OUR WORK IN JAMMU & KASHMIR AND SUCCESS STORIES**


Currently, the organization has two partners in Jammu & Kashmir, namely - Jammu and Kashmir Association of Social Workers (JKASW) and Koshish that aim towards bettering lives in the districts of Bandipora & Baramulla, and Budgam & Ganderbal respectively. The projects roughly cover a total child population of 16,705 which includes 8,419 males and 8,286 females.


We, with the help of its on-ground partners in the state, runs Child Activity Centers (CACs) that provide a safe space for these kids to play, talk about their fears and issues and express themselves. These centers are meant for never-been to school children, dropouts, children on the verge of being drop out and child labourers. Using light forms of entertainment like music, theatre, drawing and sports, these centers actively work to engage children in various activities, with the aim of restoring some level of normalcy in their lives.


The goal for CRY and CACs is to provide children with the necessary support and motivation and help them get through their tough times.


2 of our Success Stories are:


**1. Sumi Aziz:**


Sumi Aziz, lives in Nagbal village, where accessibility to the basic facilities of living is very meager and the community people have to move to the main town to buy the basic amenities for their day to day living.Sumi never joined school as she was just 1 year old when her mother passed away. Her father and brothers were labourers trying to make ends meet for their family. Her sister also dropped out of school in order to take care of household responsibilities. There was no one in Sumi’s family who could teach her the importance of education and school enrollment.


The CAC representatives identified Sumi as one of the many children who have never been to school. Meetings were conducted to educate the family first, the importance of going to school as well as to motivate Sumi to let her interest rise up in the learning process. The learning from the sessions at the CAC had developed swiftness in her learning interests and very soon she was able to get admitted to a regular school. The CAC representatives have also been actively encouraging Sumi’s elder sister Amina to get involved in the process.


**2. Nighat:**


Nighat had never been to school prior to CRY and Koshish’s intervention. The reason being, the family members being bust with their own work schedule and the school being almost 3 kilometers away from her house. The route to school from Nighat’s house was in the periphery of forest land and was unsafe for a child to go to school alone without any elder accompanying her. CRY and Koshish’s team held various meetings to get the child acquainted with basic forms of education and the fact the CAC center was very close to her home convinced Nighat’s family to opt in for the learning process. A survey was conducted to identify more children in the vicinity and a program was organized to make sure that all the children went to school together thereby eliminating the dependency on family members.

"Second Generation Indian American Returning to India, What are Your Thoughts?",0,a1f7qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a1f7qf/second_generation_indian_american_returning_to/,24,1543504991.0,"In the US, sometimes I feel as if people are so prejudged against me that I automatically become the ""creepy guy"" whenever I am around to some people. 

There have also been times where I have been mistaken for a threat in crowds as a potential terrorist or even a thief! 

Maybe it's just me having medium brown skin and Arabic like features? 

&#x200B;

Besides getting away from instances like these, I want to feel a sense of belonging and normalcy I feel like I can't get here. Getting to know Indian culture authentically, as I wasn't really exposed to this too much, and being able to volunteer extensively are also pulling me there, such as Green Peace India(pollution, trash, and cleanliness), Habitat for Humanity India(helping the poor with housing), or Robbin Hood Army(distributing surplus food to the hungry). 

&#x200B;

Many places in India, like Gurugram, New Delhi, Noida, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, ect. have  very high living conditions, economic stability, and entertainment(concerts, sports, MeetUps, ect.) on par with Western cities.

"How to find and employ a governess or a full-time tutor for an 11-year-old Russian boy from an expatriate family in the city of Gaya, Bihar, India?",66,9di7a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9di7a0/how_to_find_and_employ_a_governess_or_a_fulltime/,20,1536266913.0,"Please, sorry for my English.

The conditions:

\-  personal room (large, air-conditioned, with a private toilette) would be provided for free, it's in the house of the family;

\- all food/meals would be provided for free, and if the governess/tutor would like so, the family would be extremely happy to invite him/her to the all dinners of the family, to take meals together in the main room of the house;

\- compensation is 1200 USD per month in the INR equivalent, it's negotiable to some degree;

\- every time the car is needed, for work or during free time for some personal needs, the governess/tutor can take the car without requesting the parents of the boy;

\- if the governess/tutor want to bring her/his family to live in the employers house in the provided room, it would be ok, but *not more than 3 people.*

The responsibilities:

\- guideship and mentorship over the all activities of the boy, 24/7, excluding the time when the boy is in school (so the employee must live with a family, not simply visiting);

\- English and Hindi languages teaching assessments and help (so, the good quality of English and Hindi knowledge is the must for this position). Currently the boy can speak as his native language Russian, and somewhat 80% free English, and he didn't speak Hindi at all as per now;

\- transportation of a boy to activities needed, for example, to the sports training centers or to the medical doctors, and so on, (so, the driving license is the must for this position, car would be provided for free).

What would be your recommendations? How to find such a person in Gaya, India? The family would live in India for up to 5 years, and have no previous experience of living in India, so everything is interesting. Please, help with your advice.

Thank you very, very much.",7
[Askindia] [Help] Can you answer this 18 question interview to help teach me about Indian culture (for my college Anthropology course)?,3,9p3w9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9p3w9b/askindia_help_can_you_answer_this_18_question/,16,1539848492.0,"I have been unsuccessful finding anyone I know in the U.S. to answer these questions. I am a mother of 3 children, two who have autism, and I am in college time and a half for Pre-Pharmacy. I chose Indian culture as the topic for my paper because I love Indian cuisine, architecture, fashion, etc. I apologize if this is in anyway offensive or against the rules, but I am desperate to keep this as the topic of my paper because I just love the country so far and want to learn more. Any questions about America could be ignored if you still live in another country. Sorry if this is NOT ok!!! I figured it technically is all discussion about India so should be allowed.

(NO NAMES will be used in my paper...it is anonymous and totally neutral writing! There will be no judgment.) 

Questions are as follows (and have changed from the original 18 due to input from other users, sorry!):

Age:       

Age when you moved to the U.S. or other country (if you did):

Gender:  

Origin City and Country: 


1.	Was your marriage based on love or was it arranged? Are most marriages that you personally know of based on love, financial stability, family obligation or something else entirely?

3.	Are adoption and abortion traditionally considered options culturally and in your own opinion?
			
4.	Does your culture have celebrations for life events, like baby showers, weddings, birthdays or others? Which are most important?

5.	What are the most common languages? Do writing or body language come into play during day-to-day communication?

6.	Are there certain gender roles or expectations based on age (such as responsibilities of children during childhood or to the elderly)?

7.	Does your culture have traditional religious or spiritual beliefs? Which religion is most common?

8.	What are your views on after-life or lack-thereof and what usually happens after the death of a loved one (is there a funeral, celebration, specific mourning pattern, etc)?

9.	What are some of the main festivals and holidays specific to your culture, country or religion?

10.	Does your culture have certain ethical beliefs in regards to hospitality towards guests in your home?

11.	What type of food would be served at a typical dinner and how does it compare to food served during special occasions?

12.	Are any activities considered strictly taboo or inappropriate (such as tattoos, piercings, certain foods, homosexuality, etc.)?

13.	Are music, dance and the arts important in your origin country? What are some traditional or modern day examples?

14.	Does your origin country have any sports that stand out as more important or popular than others?

15.	What can you tell me about the current political and economic situation in your origin country? Do you see a positive or negative future?

16. Are there any widely accepted ideals that seem to be changing or evolving in recent generations?

17.	What made it difficult or easy to adjust to life in America (or another country)?

18. Is any specific behavior, approach to other people or question considered directly offensive in your culture?

19.  What are some of the most important values you have learned from your culture and would like to instill on the next generation?

I need your advice. I have destroyed my body in one year and I need to get back to who I was before.,315,7l1nor,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7l1nor/i_need_your_advice_i_have_destroyed_my_body_in/,179,1513808431.0,"Obvious throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I was employed and almost engaged till a year ago. 

One year ago, on 20/12/2016, I was fired on the spot from my very well paying job for causing massive damage to a piece of heavy machinery we had leased from another subsidiary of the same company. The machinery was so crucial and the damage so severe that the company was forced to order a replacement overnight from Germany and scrap the one I broke.

I returned home to tell my longtime live-in partner and almost-fiancee about the firing but caught her in bed with her colleague from work (Not in bed, but at home at a time they should have been working).

I kicked her out, threw out her belongings and ordered some pizza.

I enjoyed the first 2 months of unemployment immensely. I didn't inform anyone in my family of what had happened and was content with my savings (still am). I switched to a much smaller apartment with a ₹5000/month rent in order to save money.


In the next 6 months, I rarely ever ventured out. I have worn only boxers at home and track pants outside. I stopped wearing shoes and only wore loafers in the past one year. I stopped cooking food (I was extremely passionate about cooking and would cook for my girlfriend every day) and ordered from nearby restaurants every day. I hadn't realised that I was slowly digging myself into a pit from which there is no escape. I stopped calling my parents and only talked to them once a week when they called. I stopped going to the gym.

Now, I weighed 75 kgs at 180 cm in December 2016. I was fit and would participate in 5k or 10k runs everytime I got a chance. I checked my weight last week. I weigh 105 kgs now. I tried on my pants a few days ago and I couldn't even pull them up beyond my thighs. My waist size, which has been 32 since my first year of college, is now 37.

I dusted off my sports shoes and wore them and felt a sharp pain in my arches and heels as my atrophied muscles couldn't adjust to the shoes after such a long time. I went jogging today at 5 AM to hide my shame. I felt a sharp and severe pain in my chest and within 500 m, I was out of breath and felt my heartbeat shoot up to more than 120. I felt like I was about to die. I persevered till I ran a kilometre, but felt my lifespan shorten as I ran and so stopped.

I came home, defeated and in pain, stripped and stood in front of the full-length mirror naked for the first time in more than a year. My body, which I had been so proud of, has turned into misshapen lumps of fat. I could not feel the muscles underneath all the flab. For the first time, I noticed stretch marks on my thighs, the inside of my biceps and on my buttocks. My chest no longer had the chiselled shape and looked sunken above my beer belly. I never had a six-pack, but I did have a muscular abdomen. My shoulders, which were the envy of everyone at the gym, now look totally unrecognisable and laughable. My hands have lost their shape and look like the hands of someone who has never held a hammer in his hands. My penis, which had never really made me uncomfortable, looks shrivelled and smaller than it used to be.


I cannot sleep on my stomach anymore, as the fat on my abdomen puts a lot of pressure on my bladder and I wake up with a painful stomach and a painful urge to pee. Whenever I laugh, my lower back strains and throw out my back. I probably have the cholesterol levels of a very unhealthy 50-year-old man, even though I'm 29.

In one year, I have never cared what my face looked like, shaving only once every 20 days or if my beard gets too itchy. I shaved my moustache, beard and hair today and looked at a complete stranger in the mirror. I compared my face to a photograph of what I looked like a year ago and I cannot recognise myself at all.

My posture has warped and I no longer feel in control of my body. Since I haven't ventured out of my apartment, except to the nearest supermarket (to buy toothpaste, soap, etc.), I don't even remember how to carry myself. I walk like I used to, but my own body seems to rebel against me. It's as if I am in someone else's body now.

I feel like a total piece of shit and truly wish to change. I want to change. 

I need some guidance though. How do I get back to under 90 kgs? How do I fit back into shirts that now stretch over my belly? How do I stop my back from straining every time I get up from a chair or a bed? How do I push myself to run at an upcoming 5k run in 4 months? How do I get the grip and dexterity back in my fingers? I do not want to go to the gym just yet. Not till I look respectable enough to go there. I used to have friends there and I absolutely cannot show myself to them as I am now. Please help me.",7
"Apart from the Big Three (Flipkart/Amazon.in/Snapdeal), what are some other shopping portals that do a decent job in India?",230,7pltqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7pltqk/apart_from_the_big_three_flipkartamazoninsnapdeal/,149,1515676015.0,"Not saying that I have any problems with the big three, but its always better to have more options and competition as a consumer. Besides, even if there isn't any price advantage, its better to keep getting stuff from multiple vendors as history has always shown that if one shop gets a monopoly, their service always degrades over time.

Are there any lesser known portals from where you've had a decent buying experience? Please share about it.

Indianzied World,68,7j1rqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7j1rqh/indianzied_world/,33,1513022533.0,"Recently I read a post that said Saptarishi Nagamani was the inventor of BITCOIN, and bitcoin meant Black Income Target Currency Of INdia. This post denoted that a certain Mitron was working with an Indian Engineer in NASA, yeah, NASA to bring back all the black money back to India by making Bitcoin obsolete in 2019. This hell of a master plan made me think of an Utopia(?) where if the entire world was Indianised instead of being westernised. This is a work of fiction and any resemblance to the real world is the result of you listening to a Whatsapp forward from your mama in Gelf.

Those who know or have watched ""Man in the High Castle"" or have played ""Wolfenstein"" would be able to understand the background. Now let us start with food, major brands like KFC, McD, Domino's would be well and present, but with a little twist of their own. KFC would expand to Kozhis(chicken in tamil) From Chellappan, McD would be Marwari Chintu's Dokla and Domino's would be Damini's. The main ingredient of Maharaja Burger would be chaat masala, instead of french fries you would get plantain bajji and onion in/as your Piri Piri toppings. Italy would be renamed to Idly and instead of inventing pasta and pizza, they would have invented Kaara payasta and ghee burst pizza with brinjal and Moringa toppings.World would be mad about Kaapi and Chaaya. Americapuram would be mad about Filter Kaapi and teens especially would love Pumpkin spice sukku kaapi, and England would go rama over kattan chaaya. Kattan chaaya would have so much demand that the Queen herself would personally come in her Vimana to India without even Kamal inviting her for Marudhanaayagam.

Ice cream as we know it would have become Aish cream, a cold eatable made famous by Aishwarya Rai. Sambar and Roti are now available in 143 countries which was the result of Oregon Sambar rush in the 19th century. Roti began its way to become a food loved by the whole world during the international frisbee tournament when Indians introduced the thought of eating a food that was similar to the frisbee. It is also said that dosai was the result of a similar event, but it was inspired from a UFO on the sky. India also holds the patent to Venn pongal, as it is now identified as an anesthetic capable of making people sleep for extended hours.
With Indian food changing the world with its cultural footprint, international politics also saw a major change. During the 18th century, ""The Boston chaaya party of 1773"" saw the Americapuram natives protest against Britishpettai people. When India took over the Britishpettai and conquered Londonoor, the invasion was stopped by one special tree. The tree our ancient ancestors held so highly, in the Queen Elizabethammal's garden, there was a Thulasi maadam or a Thulasi plant which the queen used to take one leaf everyday morning. Looking at the clean habits of Elizabethammal, we retreated from Britishpettai. 

But things were not the same when we conqured americapuram, because the world believed that Americapuram was discovered by Christappan Columbar, while it was actually discovered by Leif Ericksapillai. Being angry at this lie, we took over Americapuram, but after we gave independence to them, it fell into hands of evil Sarkar Mishter. Barrackavetti Obamasingh. But his Raja sabai was over thrown by the white haired knight Thiruvalar. Trumpanandam with the help of Thiru.Thadimayir Kutin from Russiapradesh. But India is still unable to come to terms with Bakisthan and often this is emotion is seen coming out during the Gillidhanda match between India-Bakisthan. India has been working for world peace by often conducting sabhas and pattimandrams and thiruvizhas. But North Koreanadu alone is often giving threats against the world, though its unclear why North Koreanadu is angry on the world, most people believe that it originated when our Mitron ignored Jing Jong Jil when he asked ""Kaapi shaaptela mama?"" during one of the world peace sabhas. Though India has been struggling a lot to keep up world peace, Its efforts do not go in vain as saami kuththam is sure to do the right thing in the end.

India has been a real influencer of Pop culture and Entertainment of the world. Like the recent Despasita was inspired from our holy Ramayana, which sings the greatness about the female lead of Ramayana. Many Paapu singers tour all over the world. This touring sparked the Harmoniya potti renaissance among youngsters globally. “Avengergal: Raasi Mandhira kal” is the next installment of the famed Avengergal comics which themselves were inspired by Mahabaratha. While a smilar comic movie called, Justice Logam failed the box office, it is expected that the animated version of Batmani, set in the aaghragaraththu era to become a super hit. Famous comic characters like Naruto Usilamani from Naruto, Gopu from Dragon Paal A2, Aasha from Porukimon have references to our old literary works. 

The Mastersamayal kaar is a famous show that is taking the world by the storm. Though most times the, finalist is Thachchi Mammu, now and then Vada Paav and Paani Poori wins. Apart from food and digital beings, india has also flipped the world with its fashion sense. Dhupatta has been widely recommended as the multipurpose cloth of the century and also has to said prevent rape. Now Lungi brands flash across the New Yokoor’s Times Roundtana, and fancy panchakachams are the fad. Watches are yesterday’s fashion as kaapu takes its place.

Sports and games has always been a difficult field for India. India has always suffered from losing to NRIs in other countries. Like Michael Phelppadurai has won so much gold that he need not take any dowry from his father-in-mamanar. Also twin sisters, Serina Valli.M and Venus Valli.M keep winning the tennis tournaments. Every year Ashes happens at Uttarkhand where the teams of Britishpettai and Australiacherry get together to do Gangasnanam and let go of the ashes into the ganga river for them to reach Heaven after life. Only place where India shines is Yoga competitions as a Yogi who is said to be living for 400 years wins all the competitions. He claims his Patanjali formula makes him youthful.

Things would have been so much fun if the world was Indianized. Let me know your thoughts on this. Would be happy to write a second part if people are interested.

"India is not a country, it is a union of countries",22,6w8oqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6w8oqs/india_is_not_a_country_it_is_a_union_of_countries/,44,1503816572.0,"Ever since I can remember, I have wanted to improve the state of affairs of this country fundamentally. As a millennial, when I was young I was inspired by our independence and the patriotism that followed it. But as I grew and explored what the nation of India intrinsically meant and what it’s true genealogy was, it started spiraling down to be an empty concept. 

Nations are formed when a group of people identify themselves as belonging to a common genealogy and demand that they are the righteous owners of the land that they’re claiming as their nation. This formation of a country, in cases other than autocracy, could be incited through a common ancestry, language, religion or ideology. The Indian independence incited us to form this nation, the constitution sealed it. But what is it really that binds us? Religion? No, we’re supposedly a secular nation. Language? Of course not. Ancestry? Not so much. Ancestrally, Tamils are more related to Sri Lankans than they’re to Biharis. Ideology? Nope. 

So why are we still a single country? Because, TAX. The centre can tax the whole country which is a HUMUNGOUS sum of money considering our ever-growing population. The governments have generation after generation fooled us using ‘nationalism’ while they eat our hard-earned tax. It is our money, it is our time and energy. I have agreed through the constitution to pay taxes along with my fellow people for a service, a service called the government. The only responsibility of this service is to improve the life of it’s people. But what it has become is a handful of pigs gobbling up the tax collected from a BILLION people. With this enormous sum of money comes enormous  power, the power to buy anything and everything. The power to buy the media. The power to cause so much toxic language pollution (fake news) that none of us realize what the real problems are. The power to stagnate education and hence reason. The pigs took away education from us, the worst thing that could be done as a government, it’s worse than physically crippling one. 

When we are given statistics like India's GDP is the sixth highest, it hides a lot of important information. Per capita is what matters. We're not supposed compare an economy of 1.3 Billion to 82 million of Germany or 127 million of Japan. There is absolutely nothing to be proud of. It's fallacious, it's a pseudo-statistic. The population of Bihar and UP combined is a 300 million. Yet we're constantly fooled by similar statistics that adds to our epidemic complacency that we're a growing nation. Science, technology, economy, healthcare, sports everywhere the statistics can fool us if we see us as just one country. 

Democracy is naive. A susceptible and complacent peon has the same weightage of vote as a well-learned professor who really cares for the country and contributes 10000% more towards its economy. When the quality of the population is extremely low because of the enormous population and lack of education, votes can be bought easily because they do not have to ability to reason for themselves, a day’s wage and meal is itself an accomplishment for most. Millions of people are swayed for vote by throwing one-time food and liquor, fake promises and fake news all because the pigs never let them get educated and forcibly put them in such a situation for their own gains to power. 

I’m no anti-national. National and anti-national don’t even mean anything if one digs deeper. They’re simply terms used by people for selfish reasons to stamp a person and reduce the details of what he/she says to merely ‘national’ or ‘anti-national’. We should simply stop using these terms and use a more productive terminology to label and discuss ideas. Everything is in the details, this is not about clickbait and headlines, these are supremely complex and deep problems that cannot be discussed and solved if we use crass terminology. The pigs are chauvinists and language polluters, they don’t care, they don’t even know, they will say anything to get media’s attention and media’s attention is more votes. What we need is a radical ideological revolution to give meaning to this beautiful ‘nation’. We should evolve to form a confederacy of countries based on a modern yet moral ideology. ",7
Want to give my dad a life apart from work. What can I do? [Np],64,6cfx5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6cfx5c/want_to_give_my_dad_a_life_apart_from_work_what/,49,1495392083.0,"My dad is 52 years old. His family was one of the wealthiest business class family when he was young. But due to the unstable income in business, he decided to pursue Engineering. He loved Engineering, but his parents did not. They were okay with him doing engineering, but didn't give him any luxury that his brothers who took over my grandparent's business. He started working since he was 18 and only got enough money for fees and food from family. 

I am telling you this because my dad learnt very early in his life that he had to work hard to earn a good life for himself and his family. He comes from a Tier 2 city where (at that time) business and bank jobs dominated the market with very less value to engineers. He worked for a salary equivalent to 2,000 / Month at first. He was okay with this because he had a house to live (joint family) and his food was taken care of at home. After a point, my uncles started humiliating him because they earnt way more than he did and neither of them had even passed 10th.

This made my dad move to Bangalore when he was 28 and he worked as person who'd repair electronics. From there, he has come here. Today he is the MD of an MNC. I feel bad seeing the way he works. He leaves to work at 7:30 and comes home at 2AM Monday to Friday.

He has taken only 3 weeks off in the past 3 years, but spent that time working from home instead. He works even on weekends. I logged into his Facebook yesterday and all his colleagues have a good personal life. My dad, OTOH, is doing 3 people's jobs and he is okay with it.


Even though he enjoys it, it is going to take a toll on his health. He is not into sports or doesn't participate in social gatherings that much too. How can I give him a good personal life? Be it video games, TV shows or anything. I want to make the weekends peaceful for him. Please help.",7
Why we will never make it big in Olympics. Personal Experience,249,4wp5n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4wp5n8/why_we_will_never_make_it_big_in_olympics/,104,1470674056.0,"I was a National level U17 Athlete. I came third in Triple Jump and qualified for High Jump for Nationals but couldn't participate because of ligament tear. 

I started off in 6th standard by competing in inter school competitions. I started off in TT and Handball. I couldn't get past district level in both the games. Even though I was good, even if not excellent in these respective sports. After trying to crack TT and Handball for two years, I got fed-up and turned my attention towards track and field event. Since that was the only place were they can't do politics at least to a certain extent. 

The problem starts here. 

1. Every PET is given a particular sport to select the best playing team at district level. The ideal thing to do is to select only the best players, but the reality is that Mr. A selects most of the players from his school or if another PET recommends his student to be selected. They do select good ones but for a team to perform well, everyone needs to be the best. The district level team will compete in State level with other teams, even if there is one exceptional player in any of the district team, he will not be selected for States because his team lost. We end up losing so many highly talented players due to this stupid selection. 

2. My PET was assigned to select Hockey, naturally most of the national level players from my school were from Hockey. This is how it is for many schools. 

3. The amount of politics is insane, so many hardworking, well deserved players are not even given a chance to show their talent. The PETs wants to push their students as much as possible. 

4. Most of PETs don't know anything. They have literally no idea how to train an athlete. There were 2 PETs in my school. One was old around 40 something and another one was a newly graduated PET. If it wasn't for the newly talented PET, I wouldn't have been in nationals. She brought in so many new ways of training, that helped me perform. According to my old PET, everyday I used keep jumping, that was it. Just jump, jump and jump. 

5. No proper training facility and diet to boost the athletes. Whatever funds that are allocated for food, doesn't even reach the athletes. I trained in a non-even ground, which may been the reason for my ligament injury. 

6. Discouragement from everyone. Teachers, parents, relatives and even friends. My first Nationals was in 10th Std, the amount of beginning I had to do to get relieved from my teachers was harrowing. Everyone wants an IIT kid and not an athlete. 

7. Sports medicine. Absolutely nil. They don't even know such things exist. 

For India to shine in Olympics, it will take decades of dedicated corrective measures, change of mentality, corruption, politics to be sorted out. 

I just saw a video in the morning where Indian women's team won the 4x400 meter relay, I guess it was the CW Delhi. Indian team clocked 3:27.52 and the world record is 3:15.17, that shows the quality of athletes. 

Edit: Just remembered that my grandma's neighbour was Surekha first Indian Female Pole Vaulter to cross 4 meters. I used to visit her house when I was a small kid, she is married to Renjith Maheshwary, the Triple Jumper who qualified for Olympics. He is not a medal hope, but if he betters his jump by 17.50, he would be at least in the top 5 and that would be something.! ",7

____________________________________________

Greetings!

At least once a month I see threads on /r/India where people complain how miserable they are in the states, and how much things suck here. While I don't think this is utopia, I find that people seem to overwhelmingly dwell on the negatives to make some justification about life in India. As someone who spent about 20 years in India and about 10 in the states I feel I have an alternate viewpoint to offer. 

I got here after leading a sheltered life and had to scramble fast to figure life out on my own. In doing so I feel like I got to a position where I could choose what I wanted out of my life. So yes, I'm rather happy here and I can see why this is still the #1 immigration destination in the world (recent events in Europe notwithstanding). 

Lets set some baselines here. If you're reading this, you're at least part of the ""middle class"" with some basic education and no worries for food or housing. So if and when you do come here you'll fit into the educated middle class easily enough, if not better since the Indians that come here are quite well educated. 

Is there poverty on the streets? Sure. Does the medical system need major reform? Of course. Will any of it really affect you? Not really. Will you understand any of this if you're here for a 3 month contractor gig or a 2 week visit to your cousin's place in New Jersey? Hardly.

For most immigrants, life revolves around employment. It generates income, visa sponsorship and health insurance. Until you get your greencard, it's all or nothing. You have a job? You're probably well educated with at least a bachelor's degree and a desirable skillset. This will set you far ahead of a lot of natural born Americans and you will simply not face any of the problems they do. 

You will easily be able to rent if not own your own home in your late 20s to early 30s, live in a good suburb with at least a decent school system. If you're good with your money and investments you'll have the material comforts you want and more. 

Once you're above a paycheck to paycheck situation though, you'll realize that life is better in ways you couldn't possibly have imagined. Want to be a loner recluse and play DOTA all day? No one cares. Want to be the guy throwing BBQs all the time and having neighbors over? You can do that. Outside of downtown districts of the big cities, traffic is predictable and far more disciplined than anything you'll see in India. If you want to get swept up in the hustle and bustle of the big city, you have that option too.

Land is relatively cheap and in abundance, there are parks and trees everywhere. Gas is cheap. The entire world of media consumption is centered around the States. If you'd like you can see a band every day of the week. For free or for whatever you want to pay. I've had Kirk Hammett melt my face with a MOP solo right in front of me as I bounced in the mosh pit. I held Janelle Monae as she crowd surfed in Coachella. I high-fived Trent Reznor after his show. I've had some random band in a bar play Kashmir for his ""new Indian friends"". Pick your genre of music and the arts - you'll find a 100 other people like you. Food and craft brewing are unparalleled. 

edit: And I'm not even go into the convenience of netflix, amazon prime, newegg etc.

Depending on where you live (yes, this is big so don't use it to discard my entire premise), crime isn't a factor. I recently discovered that the tailgate on my car hadn't been locking in the last 2 years. In the mean time, I've parked it in several different cities, at least 3 states, several times in the airport and not one thing lost. I left the windows down a the bus station for an entire day and my ipod was lying in plainsight - nothing stolen. It's a great life when people aren't trying to con you 24/7.

Sit at a bar, order a shot for you and the two guys on either side of you - you'll make best friends in no time. If you have game, go talk to 2 chicks on the other side see if you get their phone number. It'll happen, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Watch a football/hockey/soccer game in a sports bar and high five random strangers as a your team scores. No one will you don't belong.

People complain about tipping, but do they tell you amazing the service industry here is? Do they tell you how any waiter will joke with you and genuinely be interested about your day? That if you complain customer rep for even a multi billion dollar bank will bend over backwards to please you?

These are not the things that people seem to talk about here. Will this be a uniform experience all over the states? Nope. I'm biased towards the white collared suburbs because that's where I fit in. But the fact is that you'll find your niche if you look and the life you want will be **far easier** to achieve here than anywhere else. 

**I've obviously focused on the positives here because that was the perspective I wanted to share. Of course there are negatives that people ~~circlejerk~~ talk about all day.** So if you are here, or are visiting - get out of your comfort zone. Don't hang out with 10 people from your city and cross road and spend all your time doing what they do. If you're in India, remember that you only see the stats worth reporting. If you feel offended that /r/worldnews focuses on rape in India tell yourself that you're not doing any better by basing your opinion of what's said on /r/politics or even reddit as a whole. 

TL;DR - India vs US - Who's to say what's better? I've made my choice, I ask that you don't decide until you see for yourself.


Edit: those that are telling me there are negatives, of course there are. I have said several times that this post is about the positives, and that they far outweigh the negatives. If you're unable to digest that without jumping in with anecdotes you're totally missing the point. Goodnight from me, have a nice day.

And thanks for the gold!",7
How to get help from the army?,370,49yr50,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/49yr50/how_to_get_help_from_the_army/,124,1457731095.0,"Me and my friends are organizing an event in my colony.

"Animal Sacrifice for bakrid is justified but not, Jallikattu, an ancient sport?",115,40xq61,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/40xq61/animal_sacrifice_for_bakrid_is_justified_but_not/,186,1452809809.0,"Previous thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/40xlky/killing_animals_for_bakrid_is_okay_but_jalikattu/
I think this is more than just minority appeasement. This is about how flawed our judicial system is. Also consider sallu bhai's case. What chance does a common man have against such hypocritical judiciary. 

EDIT: I have added my comment to elaborate the post, which you should read before believing in your false claims.

They have to regulate the instances which torture the animal. Not Ban the sport itself. But, read through the following for a deep insight into what jallikattu is all about.
> The Supreme Court of India has banned jallikattu. I am a vegetarian and defend animal rights. However, I see this judgment as an attack on Indian heritage. If the cruelty to animals is the real concern, why not ban halal slaughter first and then killing of any animal for meat before targeting jallikattu? There is no greater hypocrisy than tolerating the slaughter of millions of cattle by the meat industry while taking a holier than thou attitude toward jallikattu. The double standards of PETA and Indian SC are appalling. 
> 
> Indian judicial system is a joke. Literally millions of cases are pending for decades without any hope that the litigants would get justice. A woman who is a victim of polygamy cannot hope to receive any justice from this system. Corrupt politicians who have amassed billions are rarely punished. Yet, this pathetic institution overzealously bans a traditional sport. Martial castes, please take an antagonistic stance toward the SC judgment.
> 
> **Native breeds as a factor**
> 
> There were 130 or so cattle breeds in India 100 years ago and now there are only 37. Unless we engage with the traditional livestock keepers and support them, we will lose these breeds as well as lay the ground for commercial cattle based dairies and slaughter houses to dominate the country
> 
> Native cattle have evolved over millennia, adapting to the local environmental conditions. They are an integral part of farming, especially for small and marginal farmers as they serve multiple purposes like ploughing, transportation, source for farmyard manure. The native cattle are both an input as well as insurance to the livestock keepers. 
> 
> **Why Jallikattu matters**
> 
> Stud bulls are reared by people for jallikattu. The ones that win are much in demand for servicing the cows. Small farmers cannot afford to keep stud bulls, so each village has a common temple bull which services the cows of the village. Jallikattu is the show where bulls are brought and exhibited. The ones which are most agile (and virile) are preferred by farmers. The calves from such bulls are in demand.
> 
> Stud bulls need to be alert, virile, and agile. In the peak of their reproductive period, they need to secrete the necessary male hormones and experience adrenalin rushes and pumping hearts. They need this for them to be virile. This is in the interest of the species as selective breeding is done to propagate the species. Stud bulls are used for jallikattu and mating only. Experienced bulls enjoy the situation and display a well thought out exit from the sport. Many of them show off by shaking their heads as a warning. This shows their familiarity with the Jallikattu event.
> 
> Native cows do not yield as much milk as the imported breeds. So they don’t have a supportive or sponsored breeding programme. Artificial means are not adopted for native breeds. So as a fall out of the banning of jallikattu, they will soon fade away and become extinct.
> 
> Under article 48 of the constitution of India the state has to endeavour to preserve and improve the breeds and prevent slaughter of cows and calves and other draught and milk cattle. Hence the Union government has to intervene in this issue.
> 
> According to principles 1, 2 & 3 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to which India is a signatory state, livestock keepers are creators of breeds and custodians of animal genetic resources for food and agriculture; livestock keepers and the sustainable use of traditional breeds are dependent on the conservation of their respective ecosystems; traditional breeds represent collective property, they are the products of indigenous knowledge and the cultural expression of livestock keepers.
> 
> **Why is there so much opposition to jallikattu?**
> 
> There are two angles to the opposition.
> 
> First is the urban disconnect with rural India and all that it entails. 
>
> Policies are made by city folk. If we look at media reports over the last decade or so, every headline screams about injuries in a jallikattu event. The focus of the urban editors and reporters has always been on sensationalizing news and grabbing eyeballs. Fed with this constant diet over a decade, it’s no surprise that so many internet warriors are shouting about jallikattu.
> 
> In a year, there are 10,000 instances of a bull leaving the vaadi vaasal (gate) during jallikattu. Of the thousands of players who take part, hardly 50-100 get injured in a year, and deaths are much much less. The number of villagers who lose their lives to snake bites is easily a few hundred a year.
> 
> The second group is the dairy lobby, which wants all native breeds to be eradicated. Events like jallikattu throw a spanner in their plans of creating commercial dairy farms with imported breeds just like in the West.
> 
> Beef exporters also benefit from a ban on jallikattu and other events. Farmers bring their cattle to be sold in weekly/monthly and annual shandies. Brokers will take the cattle from the farmers and hold them to be displayed to prospective buyers. Buyers fall into 3-4 categories: (1) The jallikattu enthusiast who will buy the bulls and male calves mostly; (2) Buyers of oxen for farming/transport; (3) Buyers of cows for breeding and household usage; (4) Beef traders who are mostly if not all agents of export companies and slaughter houses based in Kerala. They buy all cattle as they are only interested in meat.
> 
> When a ban on jallikattu is in place, the simple supply-demand equation gets skewed. There are no takers in the first category, which means the bulls will only sought by the fourth category i.e. beef traders. With no demand from jallikattu enthusiasts, the price of such prized bulls falls to rock bottom. By killing the market for bulls to be used in jallikattu, the animal rights activists are directly responsible for sending them to slaughter. There is a huge demand for Bos Indicusvariety beef in the Gulf, Malaysia and Western countries. It is considered an exotic and healthy meat, just like country chicken.
>
> **Does it harm the bull?**
> 
> It is said that cruelty is meted out to animals by giving them alcohol, prodding and twisting their tails etc, that organisers beat the bulls, stuffing something pungent in their nostrils, confine them in a dark, suffocating place in order to enrage them.
> 
> The reality is different. Amidst all the regulations and scrutiny, which bull owner will risk giving alcohol to the bulls? Glucose water is given to them for stamina. Out of the 10,000 instances of bulls let out a year, the anti-jallikattu activists have produced images/videos of may be 7-8 bulls where an offence might have taken place. They have the power to identify the owner and take action against him under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Each bull is registered with the authorities, with photographs as well as the owner’s information.
> The sport consists of holding on to the hump of the bull and running along with it for a given distance usually about 20-30 meters which is covered in barely 10-20 seconds
>
> Every rule has an exception. We regulate to curtail the exceptions, but not to end the sport. The approach of the activists from day one has been to end jallikattu at any cost.
> 
> **Are there other means of conserving the breeds?**
> 
> Each breed has evolved over several millennia and in a distinct way. One method of breed conservation will not work in another area, with another breed. Every place in the world where indigenous people have lived with their livestock, there are celebratory showcase events post-harvest like kambala buffalo water racing in the Dakshin Kannada region, Ongole stone pulling in central and coastal Andhra, rekla races in western Tamil Nadu and Theni, bailgada in Maharashtra with the Killari breed. Each event has evolved locally and has stood the test of time. In-situ conservation is the best method for conserving any breed. The lifetime and health of the species is extended only due to such events.
> .
> 
> **A ban will be fatal**
> 
> Under the Convention on Biological Diversity and heritage status practices worldwide, it is customary that these ancient traditional practices are left as they are but with rules to organise and regulate them. If we lose our breeds and import foreign breeds, multinational commercial companies will dominate the dairy industry in India. The livelihood of millions in rural India is at stake here.
>

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) supports traditional practices to keep the chain intact and thus enable conservation of native breeds. As an ancient nation with an ancient practice going back millennia, jallikattu should be preserved. There is no torture of any animal of any sort that takes place during the sport and the evidence of this can be seen from live media telecasts. The time a bull spends engaged in the sport is less than 30 seconds. Rules have to be implemented to enhance the safety of the animals and men.

Frugal Fitness 101 : Or how I managed to wear the same size pants for a decade.,82,50cg6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/50cg6d/frugal_fitness_101_or_how_i_managed_to_wear_the/,61,1472608443.0,"Hello Randians. I have seen, over the past few weeks, many posts on this forum asking for advice on how to eat healthy, how to become fitter and how to lead a healthier and cleaner life. As someone with an active interest in fitness and some degree of success in losing weight and keeping it off as well, I thought I would initiate a discussion to share my two cents on this, share some of my wisdom and in the process learn something from the hive mind as well. First off, I am not a fitness trainer, nor am I an expert in nutrition. I am not an athlete or someone with an extraordinary level of fitness. I have no six pack, I have no bulging muscles, I am not a gym rat and I certainly do not have the best genes in the world. I am merely someone who has successfully kept weight gain at bay, leads a physically active lifestyle and somebody who has made sure that the waist measurement of his trousers has remained the same over the past ten years (34 :D). I have been exercising and leading an active lifestyle over the last ten years and I hope to share my wisdom with you. I will structure this post to broadly address the following points.

1)	The benefits of being fit and leading a physically active lifestyle.

2)	Goals or what one must aim for.

3)	What can one do to get fit and remain fit.

4)	Diet and lifestyle.

**The benefits of being fit and leading a physically active lifestyle** – The most obvious benefit of being in shape is, of course, a longer and healthier life. Your immune system is stronger and you fall sick less often than others. You look good and you feel good. Clothes fit you better when your body is well proportioned, and you look more attractive to the opposite sex.  You are also happier because your body is producing all those endorphins that give you a natural high. If you are a man, your testosterone production too is increased, resulting in more energy, confidence and drive. Your sex drive goes through the roof and in general, you lead a better life. If not anything else, being in shape makes sure that when everything else is going wrong in your life, [you can still go to the mirror and feel good about what you see](http://tinymuscles.com/2010/you-know-you-look-at-yourself-in-the-mirror/). Finally, there is no better feeling in the world than the feeling of having exerted your muscles and earned your night’s sleep. 

**Goals or what one must aim for** – Now that we have gotten the question of why we must be fit out of the way, let us move on to what we can realistically hope to achieve. The first thing to realise is that not everybody can get a six pack, or look like [Hrithik](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/hrithik-roshan-rediscovers-athleticism-with-kris-gethin.html). In fact, six pack abs are something that is achieved through reduction in body fat percentage and not by working out obsessively. Besides, for actors and models, their body is literally their profession and some work out upwards of six hours a day. This is neither realistic not desirable for the vast majority of us. What we should aim for is to be [lean](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/23/ff/1e/23ff1e86b38067f6674d5a9484c98d5a.jpg), [physically fit](http://lh6.ggpht.com/horatiosalt/R5YjySNWb5I/AAAAAAAAAeE/luT-5gQFmbU/s800/federer+no+shirt_thumb%5B1%5D) and to be able to exert ourselves if required with the minimum of discomfort. In my opinion, the best physiques are those of fast bowlers. [Lean](http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/image/163823.html?object=40560;page=2;dir=next;), [rangy](http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/m/l/y/2/image.related.articleLeadNarrow.300x0.1mm7c.png/1319753116963.jpg) and well proportioned, some of these men will rank among the fittest of athletes. You would be surprised to know that none of them spent their lives in the gym. To fill out a T shirt or to be able to wear a slim fit shirt, and to be able to run a mile without too much discomfort is what we must aim for. 

**What can one do to get fit and remain fit** – The human body is a well-oiled machine that runs on food intake and metabolism. Metabolism, for the noobs, is the process by which food is broken down and converted to energy. Throughout our lives, the rate at which our metabolism works fluctuates. Upto the age of 22-23, the human body is growing which means that the metabolic rate is pretty high and whatever you eat will be broken down into fuel. The age of 22 is when the human body first starts slowing down, and it no longer requires as much food intake as before. This is perhaps when people first start to put on weight. A sedentary job after college, unhealthy food habits fueled by disposable income and a lack of exercise results in many people ballooning up, seemingly with no control over their own lives. It does not have to be so. After this, the next big drop in metabolic rate is at the age of 30-32.  The pressures of work, and a sedentary lifestyle at this age is the main contributor to many of the lifestyle diseases that afflict us today. Losing weight at this age is near impossible because a slowing metabolism requires a large amount of exercise to lose weight as compared to just a few years before. Again, these are merely my observations and if anyone with relevant knowledge wants to correct me, they are welcome to do so.
Any exercise program, in order to be effective, has to include the following basics. It has to include a basic series of stretches and looseners.  It has to work out muscles in the limbs such as the arms and the legs, as well as the core. And finally, it must also include a cardiovascular exercise to ensure that you get your heart rate pumping and your lungs get a good workout. It is important to have ALL of these components in your exercise regimen in order to have a complete, holistic workout. Cardio alone will not lead to weight loss beyond a point, and you will end up being skinnyfat. Similarly, working out the muscles of the upper body and the limbs alone will also be counterproductive. Thus it is necessary to have a balanced workout to maximize the benefits of your exercise program. Any exercise regimen that provides all of these basics will transform your body and put you onto the path to physical fitness. 
The exercise program that I have been following for the past ten years and that recommend strongly is the [5BX](http://www.runnersworld.com/sweat-science/the-fighter-pilot-fitness-program) program for men. Originally conceived to keep fighter pilots in the Royal Canadian Air Force fighting fit. it has now been recognised as a complete fitness program for just about anyone. It consists of five basic exercises (Hence 5BX) that incorporate all of the above in one compact twenty minute package. The first exercise is to stretch and loosen the body. The second is a series of crunches that target the abs, core and the thighs. The third is a type of plank exercise that strengths the core and the back. The fourth exercise consists of pushups, targeting the upper body and the arms. Finally, you have a cardiovascular exercise where you can either choose between a stationary run and actual running (depending on access to a running track). The exercise program has many levels from 1 to 6, with level 1 being the easiest and 6 being the toughest. The lower levels are pretty simple and you might wonder if it is effective at all, but don’t be fooled. At the higher levels, the 5BX program is a killer that will leave you gasping for breath from the exertion. And the best part? It only takes 11 minutes a day and can be done pretty much anywhere. More information is available about this program on the internet. I strongly urge you to take a look at it. This program is all you will need to become fit, stay fit and remain fit. I’ve been following this program for ten years now and it has made me fit enough to run ten kilometers under 50 minutes with virtually zero prep. I ran a half marathon in two and a half hours with only minimal training. I run a mile in six minutes and thirty seconds. I am as lean today, as I was at the age of 18. I can still wear the same pair of jeans that I wore ten years ago. What do I credit this to? The 5BX program. There is no need for expensive gym equipment and even more expensive gym memberships. I have worked out at a gym for a year and I came back to this program because I still found it better suited for my needs than the gym. The only thing to keep in mind is that physical fitness is an ultra-long term goal, and you will only achieve your goals if you stick at it.  

**Note**: The 5BX program is exclusively for men. For women, there is a complementary program called the XBX or Ten Basic Exercises that is designed exclusively for women. 

**Diet and Lifestyle** – All of the above is of no use if you do not eat healthy and take care of your body. It goes without saying that smoking is harmful. Drinking is great in moderation. Avoid drugs, even something as harmless as marijuana. Eat well, but in moderation. Personally, I have never dieted in my life. I still eat junk food like hamburgers and pizzas, only in moderation. Try to have a good, large breakfast, a moderate lunch and alight dinner. Walk as much as you can. I am lucky that I stay in a university campus and can easily get 6-8 km of walking a day. But even otherwise, make the effort to walk instead of taking a ride. You have no idea how much exercise you can get from merely incorporating 10000 steps a day into your routine. Take the stairs, play a sport, walk to the market, go dancing (for those of you with SOs), simply be physically active.  All this contributes in micro-quantities towards a healthier life. And finally, make sure you get 8 hours of sleep a day. This can make the difference between a day filled with energy and one filled with lethargy. A lot of this merely is a reiteration of the good habits that the Adarsh Balak comics mock, but they are called good habits for a reason.  So there you have it. Fitness is something that our ancestors never gave a thought about because it was incorporated into their lifestyles. Now, it is a choice that we have to make. 
If you can add anything to this post, please do so in the comments. We can all help each other out regarding questions of diet and exercise. 

**TL;DR** – Stay active and try out this thing called the 5BX plan.

"[SERIOUS] Parents of small kids, what academic route have you planned for them given the shitty options in our education system?",132,4b7hpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4b7hpm/serious_parents_of_small_kids_what_academic_route/,100,1458509227.0,"Forgive me if this borders on ranting. I am have a 6 year old son. He has a 100 mark exam tomorrow and these are some intense shower-thoughts.

I was an academic high-flyer and so were my parents. They were firm with me but gave me whatever freedom I asked for so I have no regrets about my upbringing. It was just another academically-intense neighborhood but I had plenty of access to a nice library and sports activities, so that was enough diversions from studies. End of the day, I think I would recommend my academic phases to others. (I did run into many several assholes in the form of teachers/professors but not in the manner of breaking me). I travelled all over, retain a strong love of learning even now and experienced good things in life.

My kid is 6 and studies in an ICSE school, class 1. Till age 3 he was in the US, where I got him several books from the library each week. During our daily walks, he was able to identify all the car logos, and from the license plates learnt to count till 1000. We moved to India midway and he joined LKG in a CBSE school. He had never held a pencil till then and his LKG classwork would be write single-digit numbers(0 to 9) 48 times on a page(Grid of 6x8). He could never grasp why he should get stuck on the same number when he could so easily move on. Pretty much, all his subjects were about repetition and he lost it. Bitch teacher gave him 5/50 in Maths in the annual exam and asked us to make him repeat LKG or take him elsewhere. We took him out and put him in a Montessori for UKG. He enjoyed it but did nothing in class, but thats how Montessori worked and that year he became a very proficient reader, blasting through story books.

We moved cities and put him in ICSE for Class 1. He suffered initially and made slow progress in writing. He grasps English fluently, understands most concepts in Math, me and wife spend a lot of time using the computer to teach him instead of the stupid textbooks. He is behind other kids in terms of lifetime hours spent writing, so while he is a voracious reader(into Enid Blyton, Roald Dahl) and fairly smart his grades are still close to bottom of the class.

Now he has a 2 hour exam tomorrow. In my lifetime, the first time I ever had a 100 mark test was in Class 6. My wife's friend put her kid into the state syllabus which is pretty dilute and hopeless saying she just wants her kid to live like a kid.

This is where we are at: Do we prepare him for the real world by letting him go through an intensive early-childhood curriculum? We have cut off TV, tablets, screens - given our kids love of reading, play with them as much as we can, give them the gift of time, enhance their studies with software. (So far we have never spent more than Rs.800 on our kids birthdays). I try to torrent/read every child-raising book I can get off the internet. We do all this because:

* School fees cost a bomb

* Quality of teachers are utter shit-ass. Typically most parents re-teach their kids and some try to send for extra coaching programs.

* Seats in good quality wholesome schools are rarer than an honest political party

* Difficult to find playmates in our locality who are not spoilt brats(addicted to junk food and devices, tantrum throwing monsters)

The other choice is to put kids in a non-CBSE school in Tamil Nadu, which means less academic stress but a shitty curriculum, half-literate teachers who know jackshit, maverick kids from mostly low-income homes and less-educated parents. I dont want to go for this option because I am not sure how kids raised with low-expectations turn out when they reach ages of 10-13: do they have enough internal control to deal with their hormones, gadgets, attention-deficiency as well as work on their academic drawbacks?

**TL:DR;** Choice 1: Let kids face early childhood pressure, supplement with parental attention/care 

Choice 2: Let kids grow in a chalta-hai academic environment and peers, get them to step up their game to face the real world once they reach 10+ years of age.

###Headline Stories

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

* What’s the best place to work? If you ask your neighbourhood aunty, she will answer TCS and follow it up by proudly mentioning that her son works there as well. Thankfully, there are better ways to answer that question. The 13th edition of the largest annual survey of workplace culture in corporate India was [published](http://www.firstpost.com/business/google-is-indias-best-company-to-work-with-amex-second-best-survey-2871512.html) last week. After grilling about 1.55 lakh employees across India, the top 3 best places to work are Google India, American Express and Ujjivan Financial Services, which is an Indian microfinance company that just had a blockbuster IPO (making employees with stock options very, very rich).

* In order to not fall off your chair, just remember to read the word DEPUTY in this next sentence. New RBI Deputy Governor appointed. N. Vishwanathan, who has been an RBI insider for three decades now, was [appointed](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/rbis-deputy-governor-vishwanathan-takes-080454293.html) as one of the four deputy governors at the central bank and has been tasked with overseeing banking and financial sector regulations.

* People tend to think that they can get away with a lot of insane things after a couple of shots. After all, they don’t call it liquid courage for nothing. But apparently, when you just own the entire liquor company, your idea of the things that you can get away with also includes diverting funds worth ₹1,225 crore. Vijay Mallya’s old liquor company, United Spirits has [alleged](http://scroll.in/latest/811507/vijay-mallya-denies-united-spirits-limiteds-allegation-that-he-diverted-funds-worth-rs-1225-crore) that Mallya illegally diverted ₹1,225 crore of funds from the company to benefit his other companies such as the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines and his Force India Formula One team. Mallya, however, insists that he did no such thing.

* After the tremendous success of Air India, the government is looking to replicate the success and is likely to [launch](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/new-airline-to-connect-capitals-in-northeast-likely/articleshow/53107292.cms) one more airline specifically for the northeast region. Headquartered in Guwahati, Assam, the new airline will start with a capital of ₹150 crore and is intended to increase connectivity in the northeast.

###Footnote Stories

Millions of frustrated math students in schools across India have complained a million times about how nobody is ever going to use pythagorean theorems in real life. And how schools should teach something that people actually use in real life, like how to pay your taxes. Well, the Income Tax Department has taken that complaint to heart. As part of an effort to create a responsible taxpaying society, tax officials are set to [visit](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/i-t-officials-set-to-give-moral-science-lessons-in-schools/articleshow/53164515.cms) schools armed with powerpoints and statistics to teach kids all about taxes including how black money and tax evasion harms the economy. If civics doesn’t put the kids to sleep, now we’ve got backup.

People love freedom. Mostly because it has the word free in it. But Freedom 251 comes at a price. And that price is about ₹50,000 crore. Ringing Bells, the company behind the famous Freedom 251 smartphones that cost ₹251, is [asking](http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/report-wait-what-freedom-251-maker-ringing-bells-asks-for-rs-50000-crore-from-government-2232148) the Prime Minister for ₹50,000 crore under the Digital India initiative. Currently, the company faces a loss of up to ₹270 per unit. Given the funds, the company has promised to put a smartphone in the hands of over 750 million Indians.

Indian nutritional problems analyzed.,88,3v54ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3v54ir/indian_nutritional_problems_analyzed/,98,1449093220.0,"[Taken from this forum post](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=135993061)

I’ve done a lot of research about the nutrition problems affecting India and here is a list that summarizes all of them. Desi brahs, hope this helps you.

Diet problems:

1) Vegetarian diet
-a. Zinc deficiency
-b. Iron deficiency
-- i. Anemia
-- ii. Thyroid issues
-c. Vitamin B12 deficiency
-d. Vitamin D deficiency
-e. Vitamin A deficiency
-f. High phytate intake

2) Poorly balanced (even non vegetarian diet)
-a. High carbs (>60%)
-b. Low protein (<15% usually around 10% for pure veggies)
-c. Bad fat intake
-- i. Either high fat or low fat diet (depends on region) and most of this could be saturated fat or sometimes trans fat.
-- ii. Diet is typically very high in Omega-6 and VERY low in Omega-3 (much lower than the western average).
-- iii. In south india, ghee (mostly saturated fat) and vegetable oil (sunflower oil (high omega -6) or something worse like coconut oil/groundnut oil (high saturated fats)) are used.
-- iv. Most people haven’t even heard of flaxseed and most don’t eat fish (both good sources of Omega-3s).

3) Poor intake of food groups
-a. Dairy products
-- i. Typically only 250 ml of milk (high fat or 2%) every day
-- ii. Around 200 grams of yogurt every day, made from the same milk as above
-- iii. Cheese is not at all a part of Indian cuisine. We only have paneer (Indian cottage cheese) which is high in fat. And only north Indian cuisine uses paneer. South Indians usually don’t eat it.
-- iv. If eggetarian, egg intake is very low, like 1 egg a week or worse. Otherwise NO egg intake at all. Probably causes:
---a) Biotin deficiency
---b) Choline deficiency
--v. Calcium deficiency and Vitamin D deficiencies are very common
-b. Protein/fat sources
-- i. Abysmal nut intake (nuts eaten once a month or worse and only as part of a cooked dish or sometimes eaten as a snack(like peanuts))
-- ii. Mostly peanuts are eaten. Almonds are eaten a little less often. Other nuts are much more expensive and hence not eaten.
-- iii. Even though vegetable oils are used, due to them being labeled “fats”, people tend reduce their intake of these essential fats.
-- iv. As a result of the above two, Vitamin E intake is very low.
-- v. Even those eating non vegetarian food do so only once or twice a week.
-- vi. Non vegetarian food is seen as a delicacy.
-- vii. Fish (source of Omega-3s, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin B12, choline) or chicken is eaten but not with enough frequency to have much benefit.
-- viii. Red meat is usually avoided (good source of iron, zinc, vitamin B12 and protein).
-c. Fruits/Vegetables
-- i. Although many people are vegetarians, they don’t deserve to call themselves so. Fruit intake is pathetic. Most people do not eat any fruits at all, and those who feel the need to, eat only one or two types of fruits and only a single fruit a day if at all.
-- ii. Fruits like grapes, strawberries, blackcurrants, berries, dates etc. are expensive in comparison to the local fruits and hence are almost never eaten in most families.
-- iii. There isn’t a concept of desserts so fruit salads are unheard of in traditional cuisine
-- iv. There are many different types of vegetables available but most people tend to eat a restricted set of vegetables. Green leafy vegetables may not be eaten regularly. Magnesium deficiency may be possible (happened to me)

4) Poor quality carbohydrates
-a. Most of the carbs have very high glycemic indices
-b. North Indian diet has better quality carbohydrates if whole wheat is used for chapattis etc.
-c. Sometimes refined flour is used which lacks nutrients and fiber
-d. If bread is eaten, it is typically white.
-e. South Indian diet is particularly bad
-- i. Medium grain white rice is staple
-- ii. Tends to have low fiber
-- iii. Low satiety and hence people eat a LOT more than they should in order to feel full (firsthand experience)
-- iv. EVERY damned dish is mixed with rice. Even rasam (which is basically a soup like concoction) is poured on top of rice which has little effect on the carb to protein ratio as it is mostly water.
-- v. Rice is typically overcooked (as undercooked or correctly cooked rice is considered a sign of poverty). This raises the glycemic index to >90!
-- vi. Daily glycemic load is around 200! That’s twice the recommended value! And keep in mind this is for TRADITIONAL food as people have been eating for generations.
-- vii. Causes HUGE blood sugar spikes followed by sudden drops. Blood sugar destroys skin. Causes people to feel tired after meals and even throughout the day.
-- viii. Other dishes like breakfast and snacks are ALL basically made from pastes of rice and some dal. Example: Idli, dosa etc which have UNBELIEVABLY high glycemic indices like 95+. This dishes as with most others require almost no chewing.
-- ix. Higher prevalence of zinc deficiency than the north because of a combination of factors such as no beans (except green beans) or peas in the traditional cuisine (like kidney beans, chickpeas, lima beans etc), no nuts etc.

Lifestyle/Traditions:

1) Most people get no form of exercise
2) Academic study is given prime importance in schools resulting in decreased time and interest for sports
3) People do not even walk all that much
4) Low sunlight exposure because most people tend to avoid the sun.
5) Both my parents are highly Vitamin D deficient (6 ng/ml normal value >50). And so am I (15 ng/ml).
6) This is widespread.
7) People unwilling to accept that their diet and lifestyle is bad
8) As a result people tend to have low standards of what an “average” person should look like so anyone with excess fat or a ****ty physique is considered “normal”. Most people are super weak as well as fatty.

Effects:

1) Possible pregnancy complications or birth defects due to deficiencies in the mother (typically iron and zinc deficiency)
2) Poor development during early childhood possible (but this is more of a problem in poorer areas)
3) Delayed puberty or slow mainly due to zinc deficiency
4) Poor stamina due to widespread prevalence of anemia (More so in south india)
5) Severe deficiencies may result in stunted growth
6) Zinc + Vitamin D + essential fat deficiencies = POOR testosterone
7) High carb diet causes insulin resistance (pre-diabetes)
8) Many people have acanthosis nigricans like darkening of elbows, knees etc (indicative of insulin resistance)
9) Poor lipid profile (typically very low HDL (30 ish), high triglycerides)
10) Poor skin tone (oily/dry/acne/imperfections/dull)
11) Poor hair quality (Dry/frizzy/thin/brittle etc)
12) Because the body is bombarded by high glycemic foods, the resulting insulin spike could possibly cause a significant cortisol spike. Sugar->Insulin->Cortisol->Sugar->…
13) As a result abdominal (visceral) obesity is RAMPANT. The skinny fat look is almost SURE to occur in most people eating like this
14) Low lean muscle mass due to low protein and hormonal imbalances
15) All this fat storage and related hormone imbalances cause increased estradiol levels in men or testosterone levels in women. Mean tend to look effeminate (fat stored in all the “wrong” areas like butt, chest, face etc). Women may face increased body hair due to hirsutism (PCOS).
16) Zinc inhibits testosterone-> estradiol conversion as well as testosterone-> DHT conversion. DHT is mainly related to libido and excess levels could cause hair loss and balding as well as extreme horniness which doesn’t help the low zinc situation.
17) India has the highest number of diabetes patients in the world.
18) Heart diseases are common.
19) Poor nutrition causes low IQ but this mostly affects the poorer classes.
20) Worst of all, people have been eating like this for ages and this results in poor quality offspring (low birth weight, skinny fat baby syndrome etc) and these traits get passed on to each successive generation.
21) Hypothyroidism is common (related to low iron), results in edema, facial puffiness, eyelid puffiness, hair loss etc.

Solutions:

1) DO NOT EAT TRADITIONAL INDIAN FOOD
2) DO NOT EAT TRADITIONAL INDIAN FOOD
3) Get your blood tested to check for Vitamin D, Calcium, Thyroid hormones, Zinc, Copper, Testosterone, Estradiol, Vitamin B12 and maybe others you may want.
4) Take a quality multivitamin to fill up any possible nutritional gaps
5) Eat a balanced diet (DUH!)
6) If any deficiencies are found, fix them. ZMA usually helps most Indian dudes.
7) Use a quality protein powder (whey/casein/protein mix etc)
8) Creatine also helps
9) Once you eat right and cure all your deficiencies, have your blood checked again. In all likelihood, your values will be in range and your hormones will balance out. You will look and feel a whole lot better
10) Hit the gym!

Indian meal plans for bodybuilding - in India?,44,6vi4wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6vi4wd/indian_meal_plans_for_bodybuilding_in_india/,3,1503513788.0,"tl;dr—I'm not Indian, but I have lived in India before (small town in Kerala, 4 years) and am planning to stay in Pune for at least a few months later this year. I will only be working part-time online, so I would like to spend a good deal of my free time ""getting in shape."" When I look for information or subscription services related to healthy meals targeted toward audiences in India, the majority seems to be Western food. I prefer veg Indian food, though. What are your suggestions?

EDIT: Advice along [these lines](http://www.azadsinghfitness.com/blog/punjabi-food-for-fitness/) would be awesome!

More about me: I'm a guy from the US. In January, I left the US with the goals of escaping Trump and saving money, and because I prefer living in Asia (I lived in Japan for a year as a teenager, Kerala in my late 20s, and currently staying in Vietnam—love it here).

I was adopted from Korea, so basically, I'm a white guy in an East Asian body, and also a body that seems to maintain the same weight whether I cook vegan food for myself in the US or eat out for every meal here in Vietnam. (1.76m, 60kg, ""skinny-fat"")

I have always found it difficult to stick to exercise regimens as I have never been athletic or one to enjoy sports. However, this year, I discovered I enjoy cycling quite a bit and my city bike is currently my cardio machine and transportation here in Vietnam. I am considering getting into kettlebell exercises, so then my next thought was how to optimize my diet.

During my previous stay in India, I was living on a veg campus (not a college campus, but I don't really want to discuss it in detail) and all meals were prepared by the staff. I am not vegetarian, but when it comes to Indian food, I prefer veg over non-veg (and North Indian over South Indian, except dry upma). The only thing is that a vegetarian Indian diet is essentially all carbs and maybe a few grams of protein.

I would prefer to find a meal subscription service or a hire a cook if I can. But when I Google about this, I either find lists of ingredients (useless because I am not just going to eat boiled chana and raw almonds all day), or Western-style meal plans / recipes (why would I want to eat oatmeal in India? and oatmeal is disgusting anyway). Any suggestions on how to adapt ""real Indian food"" for this purpose? TIA!",7

**Mergers and Acquisitions**

Generally, we have found that entrepreneurs are very knowledgable about their particular business, but they’re very shallow in their knowledge about business practices that help drive value and efficiency.” – John McNamara

**RIP**

This section is dedicated to those who couldn’t make it. Those who tried, but failed. Those who raised, but burned. Those who stood, but had to sit.

* No news so far about a startup closing doors. A good news maybe.

We think that the government does not invest in a social infrastructure to develop sports and the media does not pay attention to it. While that is true and these organisations can do better, that's not the whole truth.

India has so many problems that need attention, that sports often comes off as a luxury, would you allocate money to feed the millions who are starving or make sure every college has an asphalt track. It's easy for the government to turn a blind eye toward this.

News media, covers sports all the time, they just don't have anything to say. All newspapers have a sports section, people literally read only the sports section, that's why those pages are in colour. 

**Now, what's the real problem?**

The problem is PEOPLE don't care about sports, we only do, once every four sporting years, during Olympics or world cups, when we lament about our dismal performance. This is our national time pass, we are not really concerned about improving the state of affairs, we just love to complain. 

This is the real issue. None of us play any game or sport. Look at the people in your friends circles, none of them play any sport professionally, they are just pursuing a hobby or they only played at school or college, probably making it to the state, district level, before being talked out of it, to join the rest of us in pursuit of jobs that all of us hate.

And the people who do play, at national level, mostly do it to secure cushy govt jobs or admissions via sports quota. Clearly, there's a lack of serious contenders. Because it is hard. You can be sub-par at academics, and still land a good job. That doesn't extend to sports. If you are not the best, you cannot put food on the table, and the prospects of growth is limited, once a sportsperson is out of form or suffers an injury, he/she is finished. The window of opportunity to make money or obtain fame is narrow. 

###Sports does not pay.

The solution is to make sports 1)cool and 2)lucrative. Cricket is popular because people think its cool, and those who are smitten by it and who pursue it, don't drop out because of how big you can make if you do. 

The solution is to participate, if you are good play, if you're not follow. Make noise. Buy tickets to lesser loved sporting events.

PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,41,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,1461362094.0,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs",30,3huilc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3huilc/r_updated_wiki_rules_flairs/,98,1440193031.0,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki. 

#Mobile Flairs
* AskIndia: [Ask], [AS], [Askindia],[Help]
* Sports: [SP]
* Technology: [TECH],[TE]
* Food: [FO], [Food]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political]
* Politics: [P], [Politics]",7

Hey Reddit India. Need some fitness advice/tips.,13,54ph4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/54ph4n/hey_reddit_india_need_some_fitness_advicetips/,24,1474989754.0,"This will be a long post, apologies in advance. I've been a lurker here for quite a while. Figured this is the best place to get a few pointers. I took up running a couple of years back, my weight peaking at around 89 kgs. Today I weigh around 70 kgs. I didn't change my diet while doing this. Still ate the same amount, still drank the same amount. Just made sure I ran for 4kms five days a week. Before I put on all the weight I was quite skinny. Now that I'm going that way again a lot of people have been saying I've become way too thin and look emaciated. I don't really agree with them because I feel great. My stamina has improved and I've started playing sports again. And I definitely don't look emaciated. But it does bother me enough to contemplate stopping running altogether. I decided to start working out to compliment the running. Figured some muscle would help. I have noticed a slight difference since joining the gym (slight muscle gain and more fat loss)

 Here's the problem. A lot of people in the gym are these beefed up replicas of Hercules or Achilles, okay not that good but you get the point. Really bulky muscular guys. I don't really want that.  I want some advice on how to get lean muscle. Types of workout routines. What I should eat. What I shouldn't. I'm really bad at sticking to a diet but my meals are usually a healthy mix of veg/non veg. But if something helps i will definitely give it a shot. Is there anything i should really avoid apart from the usual junk food?

This is the first time I've joined the gym and I've been relying solely on YouTube to learn different exercises. So any advice would be really really appreciated. 

Again sorry about the long post.",7

It is my **Mother's 65th** birthday next *October* and as per usual, I am in charge of researching our next destination. We really love to split our trip into 2 or to be in more than one place as opposed to just visiting 1 major city.


**INDIA** is high on my list of where to go. I am really trying to make it happen. Ideally, I am imagining;


1. Visiting big interesting Indian city or two, markets, temples, food, factories, history, etc. 

2.  One week along beaches/beach towns to end the trip relaxed. 


I'm in it for the long haul, and will be checking in for the next few weeks/months and will probably comment back to you just so you know! 



4 Adults (72, 65, 29, 24)

~14-18 Days (Roughly - can be more or less)

~$10-15,000 (Roughly - can be more or less)

*Yes*: Food, Alcohol, Warmer Weather (20C/68F+), Culture, Live Music, Animals, Beaches, History

*No*: ~~Extreme Elevation (heart problems), Extreme Sports(that being said, still Zip-lined in Costa Rica), Can't do Japan or Nepal.~~ 

Thanks for taking the time to read! I'd love to hear any suggestions you have.

**Mergers and Acquisitions**

Generally, we have found that entrepreneurs are very knowledgeable about their particular business, but they’re very shallow in their knowledge about business practices that help drive value and efficiency.” – John McNamara

*“[L&T is] my life and I have considered it as a temple with priority beyond my wife and children,”* - A. M. Naik, Executive Chairman of Larsen & Toubro, India’s largest engineering and construction company. Naik, who has worked at L&T for 52 years, will soon be [retiring](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/l-t-is-my-life-will-ensure-it-remains-in-strong-hands-naik-116071000259_1.html) and passing on the baton to a successor. But “priority beyond my wife and children”? Sounds like Mr. Naik will be sleeping on the couch for a while.

###Headline Stories

***

**Food (Wastage, Inflation)**

Shin Chan used to separate out *shimla mirch* from his meals and throw them in the trash because he didn’t like them. And also because he didn’t understand the economics of food wastage and inflation in modern India. A review by Economic Times last week [reported](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/food-wastage-can-cost-a-family-rs-80-lakh/articleshow/53127874.cms) that if the average family reduces food wastage by half and invested the savings at 10% returns, it can add up to ₹21 lakh in 30 years. However, that is not a static number since food prices tend to rise with inflation. And the inflation numbers for June [back](http://www.firstpost.com/business/cpi-inflation-at-5-77-should-ring-alarm-bells-for-new-rbi-governor-2890602.html) that claim. Food inflation was at 7.79% in June, up from 7.47% in May. Specifically, inflation in vegetables was about 14% in June, up from about 10% in May. So the next time your mother tells you to eat your vegetables, just pinch your nose and eat those godforsaken things that masquerade around as food. While that number only looks at food prices, consumer inflation which looks at prices in general stayed pretty much the same at 5.77%. Far from being a reason to pop open the champagne, “pretty much the same” still means a 22-month high. That 5.77% number should ring alarm bells for the RBI because if it crosses 6%, the RBI is required to explain to the government why it failed at keeping inflation in check. 

  

**The Business Of Cricket**

Baba Karl Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. But in India, you could easily replace religion with cricket in that sentence and it would still stand true. With cows being the only thing more sacred that cricket in India, all that religious obsession over cricket has made gods out of cricketers. And cricketers have raked in the money as they’ve turned themselves into a brand. Just a short list of businesses that Virat Kohli owns partly or entirely includes a chain of fitness centers, a clothing line, a tennis team, a football team, a wrestling team and a sport-based social network. And he’s adding one more to that list. Mr. Kohli is now a co-owner of his own [fanclub](http://yourstory.com/2016/05/virat-kohli-fanbox-privyplex/) called ‘Virat FanBox’ that sells a branded edition of Moto G smartphone that comes preloaded with his app that gives users exclusive access to him. With a price tag of ₹16,999, Virat FanBox also gets you a signed miniature cricket bat and one-year subscription to his fanclub. And of course, it has to come in a box, otherwise the name wouldn’t make sense. Time for a confession - that was news in May, not last week. Last Week In Indian Economy, bringing you week-old, and sometimes even months-old stale and smelly news since 2016. More recently though, last week Dhoni’s apparel and footwear brand Seven [marked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/dhonis-brand-seven-grosses-over-2-5-million-in-three-months/articleshow/53221126.cms) a milestone of $2.5 million in sales just three months after launching. 

  

**Gotta Catch ‘Em All!**

It started with Angry Birds. Then came Flappy Bird. And now we don’t exactly have another bird, but we have Pokemon Go. The augmented reality mobile gaming app has instantly catapulted to so much popularity that it is now bigger than Tinder and Twitter. The internet managed to give it the hug of death as well. With more than 15 million (official) [downloads](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pokemon-nintendo-business-implications-augmented-000000901.html) from 26 countries, the mobile game had to stop new players from signing up because the traffic had pushed its servers over the edge. Perhaps more noteworthy is the fact that it has managed to do the impossible. It’s managed to bring out hordes of nerds from underground basements to open-air gardens and parks, many of whom are just finding out that they are allergic to sunlight. It’s also managed to bring the stock of Nintendo up by 106% in the past two weeks. Nintendo owns 32% of The Pokemon Company, which is reportedly [making](http://www.wsj.com/articles/pokemon-chasing-investors-send-nintendo-shares-soaring-1468228206) an estimated $1.6 million per day in revenues from the game. For Nintendo, this couldn’t have come at a better time - the company’s profits fell by 61% last year due to weak sales of its console Wii U.

  

**Let The Games Begin! Again.**

The earnings season is here again. Which means newspapers don’t have to worry about filling empty space anymore. This earnings season was kicked off by three high profile names - Infosys, TCS and Reliance. As oil prices recover in the global market, petrochemical major Reliance [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/ril-q1-beats-estimates-profit4-grm-surges-to-361150bbl_7047161.html) a 4.4% increase in net profits beating expectations. The company’s currently busy preparing for a commercial launch of Reliance Jio, it’s foray into the telecom business. Moving over to names in the IT industry that reported earnings - When Donald Trump rants about foreigners stealing American jobs, this is part of what he’s unknowingly referring to. Both IT companies, TCS and Infosys are in the business of helping multinational corporations outsource their work and business is booming. But only for one of them. TCS [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tcs-q1-results-idINKCN0ZU15T) a better-than-expected 11% rise in net profit but dalal street had no love for the stock which remained flat. Perhaps due to fears over Brexit since the UK contributes 15% to the company’s revenue while the rest of Europe adds another 12%. On the other hand, while Infosys did post a 13% rise in profits, but it [lowered](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/infosys-posts-lacklustre-q1-result-slashes-outlook-2917009/) its predictions of the profit it might report throughout the rest of the year. Definitely no love for the stock which is down over 8%.

* Former RBI Governor D. Subbarao’s memoir called “Who moved my interest rate?” hit the stands last week. In the tell-all book that may cause some embarrassment to prominent leaders in the government, Subbarao [gives](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/d-subbaraos-memoirs-manmohan-singh-ignored-finance-minister-on-subbarao-term/article8850380.ece) all the dirty details of his stressful relationships with then finance ministers P. Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee. Since this book comes 3 years after his term as Governor ended, all we have to do now is wait 3 years for Raghuram Rajan (or “R3” as the social media calls him) to write a book revealing the real reason behind his resignation. Mark your calendars for 2019. 
  

* Recent research reports [indicate](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/earn/which-it-jobs-will-survive-automation-find-out/articleshow/53127553.cms) that Indian IT and Services industry is scheduled to lose about 6.4 lakh low-skilled jobs to automation over the next five years. Ugh, not another robots are taking over our jobs story. Although all the jobs at risk are at the bottom of the pyramid, this is alarming since the $160 billion IT industry is one of India’s biggest employers. We already have an R3, won’t be long before we get an R2-D2 as well. 
  

* Air India is certainly not a private sector airliner. But a lot of bureaucrats treat Air India like their own private airliner. Part of that is because they’re mandated by law to travel by Air India. That might be changing soon. In a potential policy change, bureaucrats may be [allowed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-may-lose-privilege-of-being-sole-carrier-of-government-staff-if-cabinet-note-goes-through/articleshow/53144940.cms) to choose the airline that offers the lowest fare rather than having to travel on Air India. So, Air India may lose the privilege of being sole carrier of government babus. Although, was it really a privilege before this? 
  
* You know how the bad guys in every movie always carry black suitcases full of cash to a drug deal? How much cash do you reckon is inside those suitcases? Well, if the government gets to decide, no more than ₹3 lakh. The government is considering a ban on cash [transactions](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ban-cash-transactions-of-above-rs-3-lakh-to-curb-black-money-top-court-told-1431507) of more than ₹3 lakh. Another measure under consideration seeks to ban holding more than ₹15 lakh in cash at any time.

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon.

"Is Jallikkattu as practiced today, animal abuse?",4,5q6yxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5q6yxk/is_jallikkattu_as_practiced_today_animal_abuse/,6,1485418103.0,"A link to the report by Animal Welfare Board of India member and animal welfare advocate Manoj Oswal (credit to upload by Firstpost.com):

https://www.scribd.com/document/337518407/Report-on-Jalikattu

Summary of report: Bulls were injured not during the actual act of being tamed in the arena. They were injured in transportation to the arena (ropes through nose), in the tunnel leading to the arena (provoked and hurt to get them to go into the arena), and after the official bull-taming was over (by spectators who wanted a piece of the action and chased them around).

1. Transport to Jallikkattu venue: Bulls were brought to the venue in tempos and were tied to the sides of the tempos with ropes through their noses. Many bulls were injured just en route to the venue.

2. Health Inspection at venue: Many injured bulls were passed through inspection. 

3. Animal holding area: All bulls were grouped standing together waiting for hours to get into the arena with no rest, and little water or food.

4. Tunnel leading to arena: Bulls enter the arena using a gate called vaadi vaasal. They went to the vaasal through a narrow tunnel-like area. They could sense noise and a large crowd and didn't want to go on, but were forced to go by people lined up on both sides of the tunnel who tormented it to get it to move. People in front of it pulled it forward with fingers through the nostrils. People behind the bull inserted sticks in the bull's anus.

5. Actual bull taming: In practice only 1 in 5 bulls were even handled by the bull tamers.

6. Post bull-taming, run to open end of arena: Hundreds of spectators waited for the bull at the open end of the arena to try their own hands at taming the bulls that escaped the official tamers. Quote: The bull once has been beaten up by crowd or if it managed to escape, it would run on to the road or into the village. The very system is such that the bull has to run into the village and rampage for its life. The crowd is least interested in the arena, they seem to have come to capture the bull themselves. This is quite evident from the fact that 80-90% of the spectators are on the open end of the arena where they can attack the bull themselves.

Two articles on this subject worth reading:

http://www.firstpost.com/india/jallikattu-debate-not-about-tamil-pride-anymore-its-now-a-fight-between-state-and-supreme-court-3219954.html

http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/here-s-idea-save-jallikattu-official-whose-report-got-it-banned-56293

Choice quote from the second article: Highlighting the fact that very few participants die or are injured in jallikattu, Manoj points to statistics to show that it’s mostly spectators who are victims in the sport as they are not trained.

India's failure in the Olympics and some thoughts. Let's stop looking within and look out the window a bit.,3,4wu3sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4wu3sd/indias_failure_in_the_olympics_and_some_thoughts/,8,1470741929.0,"Instead of looking within, let's look outside for a while. 

China repeatedly wins a huge number of medals in Olympics. But have you looked at the kind of sports where they gather a huge number of those medals? Synchronized Diving, Weightlifting, Badminton, Shooting, Table Tennis. Most of these are obscure sports when compared to the rest of the world. Not saying they don't do it in the common sports. But it's been a little trick in their books for a while, it seems.

China recruits elite foreign coaches for training their athletes. These cost a big amount but they do it. How many of our Indian athletes are trained by actual Olympic champions? Not many right? China also trains their athletes in foreign countries for long terms. For example, their Olympic swimmers are all trained in Australia. They have won several Golds before. 

US and China train promising kids right from their youngest possible age. It shouldn't surprise you to see a 5 year old Chinese kid dedicating all his life to be an Olympic athlete. How many of our Indian 5 year old do that? Let alone get spotted in the first instance? Don't most Indian kids swim at that age just for recreation? 

The sports culture in US and China and a lot of other Medal owning countries is huge. Kids in India are trained to be better brides or grooms but kids in these countries are spotted and trained to be better in the talent they own. It shouldn't surprise you to see a 10 year old Chinese or American kid being trained in a foreign country because their home country knows this kid is going to break records in the future. In India, if a little girl manages to cook some tea, she is adored and appreciated as a promising future bride. An Indian 5 year old kid boy who might be amazing in football but doing exceptionally well in studies would instead be pushed for his studies. Not necessarily a bad thing but he probably was much much better suited for his football skills than his studies.

For example, in Weightlifting, China has an extremely effective system of developing athletes from childhood through adulthood. They get paid a wage, they win big money from competitions. They have elite coaches at each stage of their career who are specifically suited to the needs of the athlete at that time, from instilling technical discipline as youths before lifters from most other countries have ever touched a barbell, to developing top level strength and shoring up weaknesses as seniors who've been lifting for twice as long as most other countries' lifters.

They have their education, accommodation, food, international travel etc paid for.

And then comes the infrastructure. Which includes training facilities, performance enhancing drugs, nutrition, and everything related. The Indian sports culture never took off due to the horribly imbalanced and horribly pathetic economy. With a huge population like ours, it would have been technically easier to get a bigger number of athletes but most go unheard of because of population overshadowing everything. A huge population and a world class economy would have made India the top guys in medal tally like the Olympics. 

If you side step a bit, you will see China and the US repeatedly winning Academics Olympiads too. Take a look at the medal tally for US, China and Russia in International Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy Olympiads. Hell, they have broken records there too. The Indians who do well in these International Academic Olympiads are lower in the tally but they are also the ones who get AIR in top 10 in IIT JEE or the Medical Entrances. Those kids from the US, China or Russia are exceptionally brilliant just like our Indians but they have been trained exclusively for these Olympiads for years. Indians train too but the only exclusive training we get is the regular Olympiad camp held for a month or so. 

African countries do well in athletics because of several reasons driven by the fact that they are genetically physically very fast and agile. 

I might have very little info in here but it's just a thought.",7

-----------------------------------
In December 2015, President Obama signed the Microbeads Free Waters Act, banning the use of plastic microbeads used as exfoliants in personal care products. As a previous director of the organization that first helped uncover this issue, I continue to be astonished by the massive amounts of plastic pollution that originate from a seemingly innocent act: washing our collective faces.

Winning on microbeads took a huge, national coalition of NGOs with a united strategic plan. The next iteration of that work has a new target: microfibers that come from washing synthetic clothing in washing machines.  

Oceanic gyres tend to eviscerate big plastics into smaller bits, and washing machines do the same — and even more efficiently. When you wash clothing made from synthetic materials such as polyester, tiny particles of plastic called microfibers are washed down the drain with the washing machine effluent. Microfiber pollution is one of the biggest sources of primary microplastic pollution. In a recent International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) report, washing clothing was found to be responsible for 33 percent of primary microplastic releases into the environment. Compare that to the effect of microbeads, which were banned for their paltry 2 percent contribution to watershed microplastic pollution.

For clothing brands, microfiber pollution represents an existential threat to their bottom line, and for outdoor companies, their pro-environment reputations.

**When you wash clothing made from synthetic materials such as polyester, tiny particles of plastic called microfibers are washed down the drain with the washing machine effluent.**

Why? Because fossil-fuel-derived, plastic textiles are becoming the go-to fabric of choice for sports and active lifestyle brands due to their performance attributes. Already, 60 percent of all clothing on earth is made of polyester, with even higher occurrences in activewear brands. But whether it’s yoga pants, fleece jackets or underwear, plastic clothes are the new normal — and are shedding massive amounts of persistent plastic pollutants into our shared waters and soil. Unfortunately, with increasing demand for synthetic fabrics, the problem is at risk of getting even worse.  

To give an idea of scale, it’s estimated more than 1.4 million trillion fibers are awash in the ocean, a number derived by George Leonard, chief scientist for the Ocean Conservancy, based on an extrapolation from existing data. Now, consider that government data shows more than 103 million washing machines are in the United States doing an average of eight to 10 loads of laundry per week. According to the scientific literature, each load can release between 1,900 fibers per load, to as many as 250,000 per fleece jacket, per wash.

**Microfibers are a huge source of pollution, but are they dangerous?**

It’s seriously doubtful we’re going to see a scientific study that demonstrates that animals eating plastic is a good thing. As such, many scientists agree there is cause for alarm and that a solution must be found.

What we do know is that plankton, mussels and clams eat fibers and can cause gut impaction and other serious digestive tract problems. We know one in four fish procured from a fish market in California has evidence of microfiber ingestion. We also know microfibers will attract and concentrate (up to a million times greater toxicity) other chemical pollutants present in water, and that after ingestion these toxins can leach from the plastic into an organism’s tissues. Some clothing is also treated with dangerous chemicals that will desorb into water over time as well.  

So, although we don’t know the ultimate human health connection implications yet from eating sea life, we know that larger organisms eat smaller ones, and that pollutants thus magnify up the food chain.

**So what are clothing brands doing about it?**

Forward-thinking brands have acknowledged microfiber pollution is real, and apparel company Patagonia has commissioned a study to look at their products’ contributions to the problem. But few brands have made any significant progress on mitigating their products’ impact on the environment. 

In the six years since the first seminal study demonstrating microfiber pollution was published, no clothing company has abandoned synthetic fibers for use in their products. Instead, we’ve seen an increased use of synthetic textiles, especially polyester. Brands love polyester and other synthetics for their performance attributes: they repel water, wick sweat, and the fabric stretches without getting stretched out. Although cheap to produce, polyester is twice as carbon-intensive than the next most carbon-intensive material, cotton.

Some brands, recognizing a way to solve the carbon problem, thought making clothing out of recycled plastic water and soda bottles would be a good idea. This became an overall trend for ""green activewear"" brands to tell a sustainability story. Although these efforts are well-intentioned, the effect on water and soil remains the same with regard to microfiber pollution.

It’s clear that many concerned companies examining the microplastics problem associated with clothes are still in the ‘head scratching’ phase.
As is often the case with so many environmental problems, the first solutions are ones that encourage individual actions and technical quick fixes over more complicated, systemic interventions. Although we at The Story of Stuff Project absolutely appreciate innovation and individuals’ desire to ""do good"" in the world, we’ve been in the environmental advocacy sphere long enough to be skeptical of ""sexy"" tech fixes that attempt to frame an issue as being solved ""if we all just do our part.""

Here are my thoughts on some solutions proposed so far:  

**Wash your synthetic clothes less**: We have to clean clothes eventually, which seems to indicate that clothing brands are still OK with some amount of fibers going into the environment. This strategy doesn’t address the systemic problem and places the burden on the consumer.

**Put a filter in a washing machine**: Again, this is the clothing industry looking for another industry to solve its problem. Technically, it’s difficult to put a filter inside a washing machine because the fibers it catches are so fine they end up stopping the machine from draining properly. This observation comes directly from the mouths of product developers at General Electric, with whom I’ve spoken at length.

**Put a filter outside of the washing machine**: 
This could work, but how on earth would you ever enforce it? This task seems just as hard as campaigning against all textile manufacturers, and again, it puts the burden on the public, not the producer.

**Use a filter bag inside the machine**: Recently, there has been a lot in the press around the Guppy Friend, a bag designed to stop microfiber solution by washing synthetic fabrics within the bag. This is a pretty cool stop-gap measure that allows citizens to ""do something."" I’d like this better if industry was subsidizing the cost of the bag and giving it away at point of purchase, rather than ""hoping"" people will buy them.
**
Put a fiber collector or innovative detergent in the machine**: This may have some promise, but again, how could anyone enforce this? Maybe a detergent could be invented that works as a coagulating agent that grabs all the fibers and leaves a ball of fibers at the end of a cycle. I’m spitballing, but if such a thing could be invented, you’d have to legislate that all detergent sold does this — and we’d need clothing companies to pay for the R&D that creates the product and support the legislative battle to pass the policy. Judging by how hard plastic-microbeads-loving companies fought common sense legislation, this would be very difficult to achieve.

**Stop using synthetic fabrics**: There are fabrics from natural sources that could be used more widely — bamboo, for example, can be spun into fabric in a closed loop system (where chemicals used to break down the cellulosic fiber into a usable form are captured, re-used and never enter the environment). Bamboo has a lot of pluses, and also has many of the performance attributes that polyester does.

**Update all developed country sewage treatment to tertiary filtration with the final effluent treated by cloth filters before it’s discharged**: Yes, this ultimately could stop fibers from getting into watersheds but it would require billions of dollars of infrastructure spending, and it raises other issues, such as what to do about biosolids. The only way to make this work equitably would be to pass laws that require clothing manufacturers to pay a portion of their revenue, based on size, to a fund the updates the treatment process and offset the loss of revenue derived from selling fertilizers. There are several jurisdictional barriers to work through, but what concerns me most is that eventually, a litigation-oriented nonprofit likely will sue wastewater agencies for discharging plastic fibers in violation of the Clean Water Act or some other nuanced legal theory.

**Coat textiles with a treatment that prevents shedding**: This is an interesting idea some clothing brands are assessing. Many questions remain, namely: How long would a coating last? Is the coating environmentally benign? However difficult, this is the solution I like the most so far, because it puts the burden of solving the pollution problem on the front end and on the industry responsible for creating the problem in the first place.

It’s clear that many concerned companies examining the microplastics problem associated with clothes are still in the ""head scratching"" phase. No clothing brand intended for their synthetic products to be discharged into the environment. Now that they know, they must step up and tackle the problem. As advocates and concerned citizens, we must work hard to listen to the brands but also to guide their proposed solutions and push for systemic fixes.

**Mergers and Acquisitions**

Generally, we have found that entrepreneurs are very knowledgable about their particular business, but they’re very shallow in their knowledge about business practices that help drive value and efficiency.” – John McNamara

Since my high school, photography is something that has always interested me and made my eyes sparkle in a unexplainable way. Everytime I scroll through Instagram, there is a cry inside me to try to make it as a photographer.

Moreover, as I'm jobless and the chances of getting an engineering job seems slim I am wondering if it is too late to listen to what has driven me since childhood.

Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications and courses are needed to be competent?
Or is the risk that I'm taking too huge and should I just stick to finding an engineering job?",8

He messed it up very badly.

My brother got irritated and broght him home and beat the shit out of him.

Now my brother was asking me to suggest some course or some work so that he is more engaged or busy with that.

Can you please provide what a completed 10th class student can do and what kind of opportunities helps him grow better?

My suggestions:
1. Typing institute
2. ITI
3. Any vocational course

Any suggestions you people got?

How to deal with corrupt misbehaving customs officers at the airport?,22,4fnw6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fnw6k/how_to_deal_with_corrupt_misbehaving_customs/,14,1461195081.0,"I am not an indian but I am posting on this sub because I know people in india also have to deal with same type of corruption.  I am currently studying in a foreign country and once per year I get a chance to see my family. Last time when I went back home I had two laptops with me. One of them was my personal laptop and the other one of my university(which I have to return back at the end of my degree). Some people had told me that they are not going to charge you tax if they are used laptops. But when I arrived at the airport they asked me to pay tax on the laptops. They asked me to pay 50 dollar import tax on the 2nd laptop. I told them that they were not new laptops but used ones. While I was talking to one of the officers another guy came from behind and started shouting at me. ""WHAT IS THIS ? OPEN YOUR SUITCASE. WHAT IS THAT ? WE KNOW YOU HAVE TWO MOBILES ALSO..."" . I realized later that they were only trying to pressure me into bribing them. Of course, I did not bribe them but I ended up paying 50 dollars on something I did not even own. Keep in mind that I am a student and 50 dollars is a lot of money for me. I come from a middle class family and my scholarship pays for my university.

This year I am traveling again. Of course, this time I will not take two laptops with me but I have to take some candies and presents for my family. I wanted to take a lot of presents for my mother but because of this type of behavior I am scared of taking anything. Is there any way to deal with these people without losing your hard earned money ? The presents I am going to take will be around 2000 rupees(which is the limit). Could be a bit more than 2000 rupees. How should I respond if they behave like that again ?",8

* Where should I have the film processed? Can I have it done via mail order in India?

What are photography laws in India for public places?,39,3toad9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3toad9/what_are_photography_laws_in_india_for_public/,27,1448124820.0,"I just got into an argument with my friends who were under the impression that it is illegal to take photographs of a person without their permission even in a public place. I was dazed by their belief and their view of morality regarding that. Shortly after they withdrew from the conversation, refusing to talk further and leaving me frustrated.

 I could find only a little information concerning the matter on internet. And I have a lot of questions now. There doesn't seem to be any unified concrete law for photography. If there is one please let me know. 

An important article I found [here](http://blog.sujitshetty.com/2009/04/photographers-rights-in-india.html) has this information
>Passengers are now also permitted to take photographs from inside an aircraft while in flight or landing/take off at civil aerodromes. 

Which reminds me of the [arrest of 3 for taking picture of air hostesses](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/hindu-mahasabha-functionary-among-3-arrested-for-taking-pictures-of-air-hostesses-in-indigo-flight/)

Now I am not saying whether it was morally justified to take her photos when she clearly objected, but I am questioning whether it is illegal. So if I go to a public park and take a photo of a woman, does she have the power to put me into jail if I don't delete the photos on her request?

In the aforementioned case, the persons were charged under *IPC Section 354*(assault or criminal force to **woman** with intent to outrage her modesty) and under the *Sexual Harassment of* ***Women*** *at Workplace* (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act. 

This brings me to another question, is taking pictures of a woman without consent an act of sexual harassment? And what would have been the charges if the flight attendant was a man instead of a woman?

I was reading a thread a few days ago where I read about a fellow redditor posting from a village, where he runs a business. It was interesting to learn that /r/india's users aren't just city dwellers. 

So I thought, why not start a thread where each week we post pictures based on a particular theme. /u/PiedPiperOfKremlin and I discussed a bit and decided to keep it as candid as possible.

I don't want to keep any strict rules or anything, but please avoid filters, photoshop effects or any touch ups. This isn't a photography contest but just a way for us to visually share our surroundings.

I'll keep today's theme simple. 

""The view from your window or balcony at home""

Hopefully this kicks off and turns into a regular weekly thread.

I am an engineering student, currently in 2nd year CSE(computer science). I was pathetically poor in maths but had a thing for computers and was technologically gifted from a young age. This lead to me joining diploma in Computer tech. straight after my 10th. I fared well in diploma. Although my marksheet says something else, I enjoyed studying. The obvious choice after diploma was B.E. . My mom teaches herself in one of the best engineering colleges here in Nagpur. She insisted I take up CSE as its the best branch out of all the computer branches. After consulting some other people, all the roads pointed to CSE. I joined classes 4 weeks ago (direct second year from poly). At first things were OK . Then after a few days I realized CSE students wont be taught any PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE APART FROM C!

I know computer pros will think thats the only thing you need to ""learn"" and wherever you get employed, the company will train you about everything. But I am not interested in a job. My dad has a sprawling real estate biz spanning 5 states. But neither do I intend to join him. 

Basically, I cant study theory subjects for 3 years. I just cant no matter what I do. Nor do I want to. But my parents wont allow me to quit on anything. So I cant just cancel my admission.

I am very interested in photography. Been reading on google for the past month but not knowing anyone from this field is making me skeptical  about everything on the net.The most I got from the net was, a photographer is only as good as his camera. I want to know what can I do to gradually start a photography carreer. I need something that I can continue parallel to BE.

Please reddit, I need help. I am so confused right now, I dont even know why I wrote this.

EDIT:
People, I didnt say I dont wanna continue BE. I *cant* quit doing BE. I just want some pointers how I can be more serious with my photography. I was expecting things like, you can start by giving your pics to the news paper or something, not a discussion about why I am whining about my studies. *typically reddit* 

Again, I respect my course, and I dont wanna quit it. Read the TL;DR guyz. I just want photography to help me get through this.

However, you can take your hipsterishness to new levels and start shooting real film and develop it yourself. The equipment is cheap, film is not. There's plenty of places you can get the film developed/scanned, and if you plan to develop it yourself, you can still get chemicals (although the choice is getting more and more limited). 

Black and White photography is more fun. The results are different from your average digi shots (even with your digicam's Black and White setting) and it's easy to develop at home. And the photos look great.. More dramatic. 

Color film (Negatives) will still get you better shots than your point and shoot, but since you're not instant feedback you never know if you got the shot or not (This holds a certain appeal to people - The waiting part). 

Then you have Color Slide Film which is tougher to shoot than film (harder to get exposure right), but the colors and sharpness is insane and you get to see the photos right there on the strip (Negatives are, well, negatives).

Fun Activity: Dig out the old film camera in your house, buy some Kodak Gold film (Rs100) and shoot around. Punch yourself everytime you look at the camera's back after taking a shot.

Why do people spend years preparing for civil service exams?,78,bh942l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bh942l/why_do_people_spend_years_preparing_for_civil/,73,1556230386.0,"A few months back I visited my friend who was preparing for civil service exams. The guy was preparing for the fourth consecutive year and I feel even this year he couldn't clear it so probably he would prepare again. It has been four years since we graduated from college and it is extremely difficult for me to understand how people can trade the prime years of there life for just preparing for an exam.

There is one thing called passion. I understand someone who is very passionate about say Programming, Photography, Acting etc and spends years trying to build a product, improve his photography or get a good acting role respectively. It is because these people probably are doing what they like and there is no better way of spending your 20s in my opinion. 

But preparing for civil services for such a long amount of time seems like a complete waste of time to me. People don't know what it is like to be an IAS/IPS/IES etc. They are spending so many years in their youth cramming for an exam without even knowing what it is like to be one of those things. And during this time most people have absolutely no life. I asked my friend about his daily routine and what he does on weekends etc and I was surprised how he could spend these years like that which were devoid of much human interaction, adventure, traveling, making money or doing anything that you would have good memories about down the line.

By the way, I am not questioning civil services or people preparing for that. There is nothing wrong with that. I am just asking why people continue doing it for so long when they fail the first one or two times when they don't even know if they'd like the actual job or not. I feel it is an utter waste of time even if you become an IAS after say your sixth attempt by which time you'd have spent six most prime years of your life doing absolutely nothing.",8

does it ever happen to you? I get obsessed about new hobbies for a while and then I stop them,3,bykzgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bykzgg/does_it_ever_happen_to_you_i_get_obsessed_about/,5,1560120784.0,"I am noticing a pattern with myself. I feel like I want to try new things, initially I spend lot of time researching, how to start, what all things to buy etc.. once I buy those things, it slowly fades away. I don't even feel like I am interested in those. 

I have wasted a lot of time. But moreover I feel bad about my behaviour. Here are some things I tried in the last year and how I wasted money

1. Bought an expensive guitar. Thought I will learn guitar, so bought Yamaha F310. I spent a month researching which guitar to buy, which sites to follow to learn guitar etc. I didn;t even practise for a week. Now it is gathering dust.

2. Photography. Everyone suggested don't buy an expensive camera. But I thought, photography is the one. Bought an expensive Nikon 7 series DSLR. Played around it for a month. But thats it. Now, I dont even feel like taking photos. 

3. Books. I don't read books at all. So I thought I will start reading and develop this hobby. This interest also peaked when there was a thread on randia in book suggestions. I bought most of the books which were suggested in that thread (close to 20 I think). Till today I haven't moved past first chapter of a book.

4. Drones. They were all craze last year. Bought DJI Spark and never really used it. Sold it off OLX after 6 months, bearing heavy losses. 

5. Online Mooc courses. Signed up, but never completed. Good thing coursera charges monthly basis and you can cancel anytime you want to.

6. Drawing / Doodling. Thought I will try this as a hobby. Bought so many learning material, books, sheets, pencils etc etc. In this list, this prolly is the least expensive one.

7. I guess you get the gist now. So I will just mention things: carpentry, cooking, play station 4 (though sold it off quickly with minimal loss), bicycle, skateboard, gym membership, home gym equipments, arduino electronic kits, trekking materials 

all of these have a same pattern:

1. first I find about or learn about something new on reddit or from some people trying it out. It could be entirely a new thing which I never heard of OR some thing which I never tried earlier.

2. Next I spend insane amount of time researching it. Sometimes this goes over months. (e.g. for camera, drone etc). I try to read online about each and every thing. Product related or user experiences. Sometimes I have even made notes on these things

3. I spend money, get the things which are required. 

4. I try out for couple of days to couple of weeks. Then I completely stop. 

5. Post this period, I don't even feel like thinking about or learning.

5. I feel so guilty of this, I avoid encountering those things. For example, most of the stuff is hidden or kept away in cupboard so that I don't look at them everyday. I avoid whatsapp / telegram related groups, like photography groups etc completely. 

6. Then I find something new to obsess about and the whole thing repeats. 

Does this happen with any of you here?",8

I failed 12th last year and lost an opportunity to go to a pretty good university in the Netherlands (I was conditionally accepted)
I'm stuck at home for the past year, a vegetable, gained back the 10kgs I lost.
The thing is that I can't really stick to a single interest. I get bored easily and I'm interested in almost every single out there. I'm primarily into coding both frontend and backend but at the same time I'm into photography, music production, illustration, filmmaking, electronics to an extent where I wanted to build an electric bike. I'm clear that I want to code for a living but all of these other interests of mine randomly distract me to a point where I can't focus on anything. I've failed my retake and my final attempt to pass 12th grade is next week and I'm really not that prepared. 
I'm retaking 3 subjects. Maths, physics and computer science. Subjects I like but due to how misinformed I was I took them at the higher level. (Like maths higher level is basically university level maths). I survived for almost 2 years and broke down during the last few months of my initial boards.

I don't believe any university level education is required for what I want to do. I don't want to work for any company in the IT sector after seeing what my parents have been through and also stuff they do there is not what I'm interested in. I want to be self employed either as a freelancer or a company of my own, and that's something that has resonated with me for a long time.

I'm at a very confusing point in life. Uncles, Aunties, Chachas, Mamis, all have some opinion or other. Thought I'd get some (more) advice from this community!

Here's my bio data:
+ BOARDS: CBSE, Delhi, 95.4 aggregate, 95.5 best of four. (PCM, English Elective, CS)
+ JEE Main: CRL 82k, nor writing advance.
+ BITSAT: 210 marks.
+ COMEDK: 7452 CRL

Now, here's my interests and the skills I think I possess:
+ Love the outdoors, really love it. And not just in that urban instagram sense. I'd like to learn more about the environment, how everything supports everything else. All that.
+ I'm good at expressing myself, and not scared of crowds, or of interacting with complete strangers. I really enjoy conversing with people.
+ I'm good at digital art. Have done some freelance work. Also decent at photography, but I only take pictures to manipulate for my art.
+ I love Mathematics and Computers, and to a great extent Physics.

Finally, here's the options I think I have at this point, and these are the ones I really like:
1. B.Sc in Mathematics or Statistics ( from DU )
2. B.Sc in Geology ( from DU )
3. Civil Engineering ( from some college in Bangalore )
4. Environmental Engineering ( from DTU, might get this in spot round )
5. Take a drop, prepare for JEE properly. ( I had given up coaching in June last year )

As you can probably tell, I'm pretty confused about what to do. I am not so sure about taking a drop as it is a huge investment, of both time and money. And I don't know how much I'll improve my rank.

About B.Sc, people say it isn't good enough for going into the job market.

I'd like to know the career prospects of all the options I'm considering. Please also tell me if I should be thinking about any other options. Any other advice that might help is also appreciated.

Thanks a lot for your time!

Reddit India Recap of 2018,213,ab62uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ab62uu/reddit_india_recap_of_2018/,31,1546281792.0,"Welcome to the first ever installment of a year in review of this subreddit where we look at some of the best and most influential events and posts of this year. 

2018 has been quite a rollercoaster of a year for this subreddit as well as the country! With one of the highest growth rates ever of this subreddit. We grew from just above 100K subscribers to now more than the 1.6L magic number of subscribers. 

The year saw landmarks Supreme Court judgements in India, most importantly the striking of Section 377 of the IPC criminalizing gay sex. We have had many amazing posts this year which go from the entire subreddit grouping together to help people in Kerala with the largest donation drive ever on this subreddit with verified donations over ₹7,00,000 to paying college fees of a user who couldn't afford to. 

Here are some highlights in **no particular order** which made up this year of r/india: 

* [The massive Kerala donation drive started](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/981o7s/will_donate_thrice_the_number_of_upvotes_amount/) by /u/TheBeginnerr to match the donations to the upvotes of the thread inspired hundreds of Redditors to donate to the Kerala Disaster Relief Fund.  

* [Hindustan pencils responding to a request by a mother](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7k0muz/a_mother_wrote_to_hindustan_pencils_about_her/) sends special sharpeners created to be used by left-handed people with ease.

And the [beautiful image of a son no longer being considered a criminal](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9dt64s/if_you_are_not_moved_by_this_picture_i_wish_i_had/) became one of the highest voted posts of this year. 

* Among the many historical posts, r/india particularly loved the pictures of [three women training to be doctors (1885)](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7mczx1/an_indian_woman_a_japanese_woman_and_a_syrian/),  [historical photos of Bhagat Singh posted on the day of his death anniversary](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/86h70i/87_years_ago_today_shaheed_bhagat_singh_was/),  a [smog-free New Delhi from the 1950s](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9wow0r/new_delhi_in_1950s_clean_air_without_smog/), [a French boy introducing himself to Indian soldiers during the First World War](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7x16j8/a_french_boy_introduces_himself_to_indian/) and [Prof. C.V Raman teaching in 1960s](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9d7nxf/1960s_physicist_cvraman_teaching_in_class/).

Broke up 30! What next???,12,al2pdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/al2pdh/broke_up_30_what_next/,12,1548813778.0,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

Need of advice from married people on choosing a life partner,13,ad5bax,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ad5bax/need_of_advice_from_married_people_on_choosing_a/,22,1546807714.0,"_TL;DR_ Would you settle and make best out of what you have got or would you take risk and try harder? Not that I will blindly follow one's advice but it will help me to take good decision.

I'm from middle class who is an introvert, well groomed, fit and active. Having varied interests and hobbies keeps me occupied esp., travelling, trekking and photography. Working in a small IT startup I earn enough to live a comfortable life.

My parents have been trying to get me married for the past 3 years. Coming from a small city, my family is moderately conservative. They definitely want a bride in same caste and matching horroscope. Most preferably in same city so that they can know well about bride's family background. We are signed up in matrimonial sites also. The selection process is usually this: my parents check for kundli match and girl's family, out of which I choose one that's looking good, then if both families agree do we have a meeting in a temple. That's when I look for matching personality.

Parents are dissatisfied and already tired of me as I'm picky. They expect me to choose the one just with good family and kundli match. They don't care about personality and the appearance. Met couple of potential bride vis a vis with family in a temple who were good looking but are boring ""family girls"" who doesn't have passion for anything nor did they show interest in what I do. So we didn't proceed.

Recently I met similar one. We talked for 15 mins. It was me talking most of the time. She asked about my job, do I own car, can I cook. I try to understand her from her daily activities. She was like home-to-work, work-to-home in weekdays and may visit malls in the weekends if not visiting hometown. There wasn't much of similarities other than both of us are in software industry. Her realtive was rushing to end this talk and she didn't have anything to talk. Their family and girl instantly showed their interest to proceed. I held my parents, who were also interested, and said we'll go home and reply.

It was difficult for me to decide life partner within few minutes. I want to know many other things including whether she can keep herself healthy and fit in the future, whether she is interested to accompany me for weekend trips, etc. Made my parents to call them and ask for a casual meeting in a public place. They refused and will allow further talks only if I say yes. Pretty conservative and probably they fear I might reject after the talk and it'll be a shame for them.

I'm gonna hit 30 soon. It's considered past marriageable age by many. So, fewer opportunities. Also skewed sex ratio! I'm confused shall I settle for this (like [Bojack says](https://youtu.be/cTAi_3HWKHQ) ) or take risk and look out further. I appreciate your advice.

_EDIT:_ To provide better context, I don't have much of social circle. There are few male friends with whom I hangout occasionally and travel. They also don't have girlfriends. Actually they don't care about it. My introversion wasn't helpful to find a life partner.
I have had couple of relationships in the past whom I met through dating apps. They lasted few months to a year. If it were strong, I would be determined to marry irrespective of parents' approval. But no. Time is ticking more loudly now.",8

Majority of my usage is streaming, texting, photography and social media. My usage is also rough

My requirements are:
1) Good lasting battery
2) Good build quality, durable
3) No lags

Also, what advantages do Stock Android offer over Color OS and vice versa?

I think while Google may not have added the Indian cities to their street view coverage, these toy train routes are awesome. I wish Google added more of the scenic mountainous regions in India like Konkan railway, Leh / Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh etc.

Since all these PMs had similar questions and I'm sure many others have similar questions but didn't PM, I'm consolidating them in here. So my thoughts on how candidates should go about getting hired

**My college sucks. I’ll be graduating in a year or two. What to do? What should I learn? What project should I do?**

Firstly, I'll just give a brief rundown of where I see the IT industry heading over the next 5-10 years. I think the 3 safest areas to build your career around are Android, iOS and Javascript. 

I do not see any other mobile OS breaking the dominance of Android or iOS in the next 10 years - the mobile OS wars are over and we are heading into the territory where Windows and OS X are now for the desktop. So learning Java/Android and Swift/iOS are safe bets. I do not see cross platform toolkits (Ionic, Xamarin etc) expanding beyond a niche so you don't need to worry about them. 

For web based apps, Javascript will always be evergreen since it is impossible for browsers to change the HTML/CSS/JS paradigm. And even for serverside, it looks like Node.js (a web framework written in Javascript) will beat out Ruby on Rails (web framework written in Ruby) and Django (a web framework written in Python) eventually. However it isn't clear who'll win the client side framework wars (React? Vue? Angular? Some new framework?) so this is a tricky part. However, client side frameworks are fairly simple and learning one should provide a roadmap to learning all others.

My recommendation - pick either Javascript (Node.js + one of React/Vue/Angular) or Android/Java or iOS/Swift. Keep in mind though that Android/Java and iOS/Swift are more likely to be popular in consumer apps while Javascript (web apps) are more likely to be popular in business apps. Business apps generally quietly make lots and lots and lots of money but consumer apps are more fun to work on. Choose wisely. 

Now you've picked one - what project to do? Pick a hobby you have - music? photography? fitness?. *Make something that you will use everyday in this hobby*. For example, if fitness is your hobby then you can make a fitness goal tracking app. Divide the project into different levels of progression. Level one can be a simple way to log your workouts. Level two can be adding user profiles so you can see your friends workouts. Level three can be adding GPS tracking. Level four can be adding tracking diet. And so on. By the time you go for an interview, this project with all its different modules will be like your baby and you'll be able to spend hours talking about it.

Its important to pick a project where the app you'll build is something you will use. You'll never use a library management system or restaurant order management system so there is no point building these types of apps even though they most commonly show up when you search for ""app ideas"".

**<Insert Story of Company Recruitment Being Terrible/Time in Company Being Terrible>. Can you recommend me good companies?**

This is tricky. Sometimes, especially in big companies, they can be both great and terrible at the same time - because its your manager who usually sets the experience in the company. I can't really recommend but I can give some steps for finding ones. Firstly do not subscribe to cliches like that MNCs = evil, crappy work and startups = force of good, exciting work or Indian companies = all suck, crappy and US companies = amazing, high quality work. They are plenty of well run, great MNCs and plenty of terrible startups and well run Indian companies and crappy US companies . 

Here you'll have to put aside your programming skills and work on your social engineering skills. First, try and identify who'll be your manager. Ask your interviewers who'll be your manager after you are selected. Try and read up on him, web, his blogs, Linkedin etc. Try and see if can use your web stalking skills to find some ex-employees of him. Take them out for coffee or beer and try and get a sense of how they feel like their manager it. It might sound like too much work but its better than spending a year in hell counting down the days to when you can get your job and and move on from your nightmare of a manager.

**Certifications? Yay or nay?**

**NAY NAY NAY A HUNDRED TIMES NAY**. I can't believe we are still asking this question. I have yet to see a certification that actually was helpful. The only companies that seem to care about certifications are the ones that issue them themselves e.g. Cisco. 

**Time gap, failed papers, no degree, marks too low or something else negative. What to do?**

There is little you can do about it. A company will ever have a policy on it (e.g. not hire people without graduate degrees or with supplies) and there is nothing you can do about it OR they will not have a policy on it in which they will almost always hire you if you are good enough since there is a shortage of good CS engineers and all companies are desperate. Just make up some story to explain all these - family could not afford, medical reasons, family emergency etc a bit of white lies is better in this case than brutal honesty (I decided to just play video games all semester).

**Can I work with you?**

I should have written the rant 3 years ago when I was still recruiting :). Unfortunately, about 2 years ago I decided to just keep my business on autopilot mode. This meant transiting out of full time employees to short term contractors. I little over 30 now - have sufficient savings from both working in USA and from my business and will eventually sell my business in 1-2 years so I have no financial urgency to work for the next couple of years. So, I am just taking it easy mostly these days, trying to think of what new adventures await and shitposting on Randia =). ",8

I've been thoroughly incapacitated by depression- which I've had for about five years now- and cannot hold a routine for shit. I'm taking therapy and medication, but depression isn't the only issue apparently, anxiety is a huge problem too.

Who are you to decide what hobby is worth my time? Sounds like you are the kind of person to micro-manage your employees and be on people's shoulders like vedhal is to vikramadithya. Also sounds like you are/will be the kind of parent who does not like what their child is doing and would like him/her to study engineering.

> DumbwitPatra:
> What is your expectation from an employer? How can I, as an employer, assess you and be sure you're unlike the others? Jobs ARE available. But the people aren't knowledgeable enough. Even engineering passouts with 80-85% can't crack simple dynamic programming questions. I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people. If you're one among them, you'll get a job. If you aren't, you need to have visible proof that you have put in efforts to specialize in a particular field. The guy who is leading the AI team in my company is from BBA background. He learnt AI and math from the internet, built some applications and had content that would show his efforts. If you do have something like that, take your idea to a hackathon. You'll have your idea recognized even if you don't win and will get a job. However, I'm not sure if i understood your question right. What are you expecting from your employer and what change do you want to see in the way hiring is done?

Quantitative Aptitude exams. The messages you are sending to your prospective employees are:

* You only care about speed and memorizing power and nothing else about the developer because all your talk of github profiles and other hobbies does not come into play until you see my resume yourself which is usually after all the written rounds.
* For all the talk of being the risk takers in the industry, you don't want to trust your prospective employee so you pass up on a potentially good employee who may not have the best aptitude test taking skills.

What you expect to happen:

* You assume good aptitude problem skills imply good problem solving skills.
* You assume people won't game the aptitude round and learn just enough to pass that round.
* You assume that all the brilliant programmers solve the problems in no time and you are left with a roster of excellent developers.

What usually happens:

* People game the system and just study how to solve the test problems.
* Actually good developers may not have the time to study aptitude problems because, surprise! they are busy learning actual programming. Many good developers get filtered out in the first round due to the lack of knowledge in aptitude.

> I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people.

15 or 20 students per college seems like the right amount of students who are actually passionate about their field. When the stakes are high, Skills go down a few notches. It's the observer effect. As soon as people find out they are being assessed or being watched they don't perform as well.

> What are you expecting from your employer?

* If you want Tom Cruise as your boyfriend, you need to be Cameron Diaz. If you want brilliant developers, you must be a innovating company who offers their weight in salary and/or Resume Value. If I am a good developer, then it is possible I know my worth. I am not going to put up with you for $400 a month or less.

* Stop taking credit for my work. I once heard that my friend got a pat in the back for making the company $12000. He never got a bonus or saw $1 of that money.

* I want you to stop whining and start treating employees like human beings. Pay them a proper wage and give them interesting problems to solve. Automate the boring stuff. Don't ask me to do the documentation manually. Haven't you heard of tools that do the documentation from comments in code?

* Once I am hired. I want a manager who actually understands what I am saying and not some prison warden who intimidates devs to get things done before a very early deadline that they came up with without consulting the devs. This is a sure way to make devs secretly hate you while burning out.

* I want reasonable work-life balance. I am passionate about programming, but I am a human being too.

* More investment into employee training or undergraduate education in the government. I know IT companies lobby a lot, so I expect them to actually put effort to improve the syllabus of colleges to suit what they want in terms of technical knowledge by diverting some money towards education.

Yes but I am not the one whining about not finding good developers. It is the employers looking for good developers but are not willing to pay them a living wage.

> People working as game testers for ₹10000 per month

There is your problem. Why are you not willing to pay more?

I am not personally looking for a job. I have one. It is good but I notice the bad side of IT occasionally. Namely the ""this will do"" attitude from people who expect a lot for less. It's about managing your expectations as an employer when you are asking your employees to manager their expectations of their salary.

I need some help in deciding what to do with my life. Any help would be appreciated.,36,7fxfgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7fxfgw/i_need_some_help_in_deciding_what_to_do_with_my/,22,1511837525.0,"Sorry for this huge wall of text, but I have to be detailed in this because I need some help.

I'm in a very weird situation in life right now and could use some advice. Please be honest. I'll give you a little background about myself without trying to dox me. I am a 25-year-old graphic designer by profession. I graduated from an average college in 2013 with a degree in Journalism (one of the biggest mistakes of my life, especially in terms of the three years I lost). After graduating from college, I was in a tough financial situation, so I had to immediately get a job to support myself. Since I knew the basics of photoshop, I just applied for a job as a graphic designer with an agency and got it. I worked there for 8 months, and quit due to deteriorating mental health. After that, I spent about a year and a half battling that mental condition, which still affects me, and again, got a job as a graphic designer at a startup, due to financial strain. I worked at that job for 6 months (till the company closed down) and then got my current job, which I have been working at for around 1.5 years, again, because I have no other skills. Now, in this 1.5 years + 6 months, is where I properly learned the tools of design and got some idea of how the industry works on the design front. Again, I never had any ambition in this field, I just got into because I had no other skills.

Another thing about my ""career""; Since I said, I took this job out of desperation, I'll be honest with you about my skills. Design doesn't come naturally to me. I have zero thought process on how to design. I have to look at tons of other things (like brochures, ads etc.) to even begin conceptualizing a layout or color scheme. I have come across some seriously talented and dedicated designers and sometimes feels ashamed of myself on how I work. Also, I am not terrible at what I do. I am pretty decent. Especially when I put my heart to it. But over the last few months, my mental issues, lack of confidence and general bleak outlook on life has made my job harder.

Now, I feel, that this job has reached a plateau phase and I have to do something better with my life. I was wondering if I should enroll in National Institute of Design's Graphic Design Post Graduate program. I don't know if it will actually help me learn or improve my life and job prospects in any way, but so far, whatever I do, I learned on the job.

Now some other details. Right now, I get paid 30K a month out of which, if I live an absolutely frugal lifestyle (no eating out in fancy places, no beer, no trips, no shopping), I save around 5K minimum around 10K maximum. I am talking about in terms of savings. If I do plan to enroll, I will only be able to in the 2019-2021 Batch. I feel I will need a year to start properly saving up, get loans, writing all the entrance exams and preparing myself.

Now here are my other concerns. When I look at this roadmap, I will be ""job ready"" only by the age of 29. Which is a very scary thought for me, because I will be sorta back to square one. Another major issue for me is, even though my life is quite bleak, one of the few things in life that keep me going is the woman I love. She is not the kind who will ever pressurize me into marriage (even though her parents will) and she told me, if I am serious about this, she will convince them to wait for me to finish graduating.

I want to know, is this sudden jump worth the risk? Honestly speaking, I feel very depressed and quite often suicidal because of the mediocre life I have led so far, and nothing seems like a happy ending to me. Even thinking of this move, has taken a huge toll on my already deteriorating mental health. I am talking about if this will help me long term in terms of career opportunities. I don't aim to slack off and ""party"" through college if I get in. I am willing to slog to the point of death if this will actually help me.

What would really help me, other than general advice is, if anyone has studied in NID, they could tell me if the course is worth my time and money. Will I actually learn something there? Like I said, I am ready to work my ass off because I know I only have one shot at this and I don't want to botch that. Also, if you do know anyone who studied there, could you please link them to this post, or just ask them?

**Edit:** Hey guys. Sorry, I just saw the post now. Wasn't feeling to well and just wen't to bed after posting. First of all, thanks for taking your time and talking to me. I am sorry that I didn't state much of my technical knowledge and the source of motivation for me to even look up NID.

**Source of motivation:** So, like I mentioned above, I got into design because I HAD to get a job, and the only bankable skill I had was how to use photoshop. Everything else, I learnt on the job, mostly through trial and error. I started feeling a course in design would help me because it will give me a more structured approach into working.  A better understanding of layouts, colors, what works, what doesn't. Honestly, one of the biggest drawbacks I have is, convincing the client of the final design. Like, even when I present it to them, I do it with this weird look showing a huge lack in confidence, and that usually lets them ask me for multiple changes or with them saying they are not happy with the design. The current job I am working at, my boss is my friend from college, and he encourages me a lot to work without thinking of these things, but in the end, when I interact with the clients, this still happens. They say, yeah, the design is okay. Could we have another iteration? My friend is the one who convinces them into accepting the design saying a lot of business jargon. Bottom line is, I always see my work as mediocre and cannot accept it as what it is. I know, a Degree from NID won't immediately have an impact in my thought process, but I fell, I can at least support my self by saying, I do have an idea of what I want to do.

Another question I came across a few times with the answers you people wrote were whether I am looking to study for a bump up in the salary? My answer is primarily no. Yes, overtime I would love a nice paying job, but right now, it's more of me to learn something, because everything I do right now is from looking at other peoples works. I don't know how correct I am when I say this, but I feel that a degree from NID will add that prestigious college stamp, and help me get better opportunities and a better network too. And and some weight to me, mentally, in terms of confidence.

Technical Knowledge and hobbies - Adobe Illustrator (most proficient in this), Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. Hobbies - Photography (very amateur). I can write a bit of content too. But it's not something I would market.

Another weird point (I don't know if it's relevant) is, I am quite well versed in pop culture and ""western culture"" of sorts. The reason I am bringing this up is, I use this as a major influence when I work in terms of design. Many menus and interior decor designs I did for my clients (which they loved), were inspired from this and they said it looks and feels much different from boring things they usually see elsewhere. I mean, it's not a huge skill. Lot of people nowadays are more ""globalized"" and dazzle people with one liners from TV shows and all in their designs, but I just mentioned this, because the agency I work for got a lot of praise from these ""out-of-box-for-india"" style work.",8

* Performance not an issue. My previous phone was a J7 and was satisfied by it's performance. Most of it's usage was for PDFs and the usual social media apps
* Not much into gaming barring one or two football games. 
* Around 15K.   

I'd be joining a private engineering college\(probably IT or CSE\) this July.So, any phone suggestion that might be useful for the course and satisfies more than half of the forementioned criterias will be welcomed.

Thank you. ",8
[R] Why are Indians blindly running after MONEY???,26,5zqaur,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5zqaur/r_why_are_indians_blindly_running_after_money/,99,1489696433.0,"What i dont understand is that why do Indians run for Money!!!. Wherever i look, everyday, i see Indians trying to get squeeze every inch of a penny from customers, trying to sell everything possible. etc. 

The people working for salaries like 50k or even 90k or 1.5L a month, don't actually have a life. to be honest ( MY opinion)

Okay, a person earning 1.5 L a month (like a cousin in delhi does) is extremely busy all the time. I have seen high earning salaried class, going to offices from 7 AM (2 hour drive) , returning at 10pm. Sometimes, they are thrown away to projects in other cities for months at a time. 

And in some places, Saturdays are also working. and on top of that, fierce competition, stress, anxiety. 

I know a person earning 3L a month. He has to go to office at 8am, and he returns at 11pm. He works in exports (Merchandiser). The stress he is in everyday in unbelievable. He suffers from insomnia and panic attacks. Is this MONEY worth your health???

People are dying In exchange for What? MONEY? shit doesnt get more stupid then this. 

Before people start burning me and asking me how i live my life. I basically started from scratch with clear goals in Mind when i made my own company at age of 21
1) Work only 4 hours a day
2) Holidays - 2 atleast in a year
3) No Stress related work
4) Debtfree forever
5) Self-Sustaining income
6) Passive income from investments

Today, even if i dont work, i can live through my life from passive income. Hell, i can live even without passive income. 

And a lot of Indians can live like the way i live. But they choose not to , for one simple reason. MORE MONEY. 

A lot of people i know personally. like 95% of them, live under loans. Car loans, house loans, credit card lines, PC limits, etc. They are basically stuck in a vicious circle of being a spend thrift and then working their asses off to pay the monthly obligations and creating more obligations for themselves for a FAKE future. 

Although when you transfer yourself into a more frugal and acceptable way of living, you will realise that the true happiness if being with your family, spending time with kids, chilling out in the sun and not thinking you will be late for office. And most importantly, being DEBT-FREE. Only after that you can think of creating Self-Sustaining earning for yourselves. 

Just ask yourself few questions and maybe they don't all apply to you, and maybe a few of them do. But if they do, just think why are you doing this? and creating Stress for yourself.
1. Why do you need a phone that costs 40k+?
2. Why do you need to buy a house on loan?
3. Why buy a car on loan? 
4. Why spend what you dont have yet (C.C.)
5. Why work more than 45 Hours a week? 
6. Why you go on a holiday and post pictures on facebook EVERYTIME? (Occasionally its okay)
7. Why do you put pictures of the food you eat on Insta, FB, Twitter??? 
8. Does it feel like, you are travelling to various places just to put pictures on your facebook and insta??? and if it does, why do you do it?
9. Dont you feel that your Job is hindering in doing what you actually LIKE? (Travelling, Hiking, Trekking, Exploring) etc.
10. Even if you can afford the most expensive phones? why do you ACTUALLY need it? have you asked yourself that? 
11. Have you lost touch with various people you loved? and WHY have you? Lack of TIME?
12. Do you want to learn something technical and CANT DO SO EVER? (Guitar, photography, boating, climbing, learning a piano, learning another language)

These are just A FEW of the things, which everyone of you must ask yourself. Because ultimately at the end, We are all going to die, one way or another. And to be brutally honest, a lot of people are going to regret how they lived their life. Not everything is about ""MORE MONEY"". And when you die, most probably you will be forgotten in 50 years. and that too if you become a celebrity. Otherwise, chances are you will be forgotten instantly. 

I have even seen people mentioning a ""BALANCE"". What balance? that you work for 6 days a week for 8 hours a day and then Sunday is a BALANCE? because that shit doesn't sound like a 50/50 balance to me. We sleep around 8 hours a day. And the rest of activities we SHOULD be doing in a day would constitute for around 7-8 hours (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Exercise, Errands). What you are left with is about 8 hours FREE. in which most of you only WORK. Exercise is totally forgotten. and even that 2 hours for exercise is given to work. 

Where is the time for yourself? to contemplate? to think? to feel about yourself? to do things you ACTUALLY want to do? 

I think even working for 4 hours a day is TOO MUCH. and should infact be only 2-3 hours. 

Money is just something the BANKS have created out of thin air, on which they ask you to pay an interest!!!. 

Have you thought about where the INTEREST money comes from which you pay??? . You guessed it, BANKS print them too. There is no Way out of the DEBT system. 

Only changes in your lifestyle and the way you feel about the world can result in self sustainable income and environment , where you can do things you want. 

Think about these things deeply.

Everything looked good - It's a got a nice google map showing currently available bais, interviews, etc. It even has testimonials.

I was going through these, and then I saw something familiar - [Screenshot just in case they delete it.](https://i.imgur.com/hS0XLiS.png)

'Gauri Desai' was a stock photo. How was I sure? Because that [same](http://shethepeople.tv/pune-ensuring-womens-safety-on-new-years-eve/) damn [photo](http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120902/spectrum/main1.htm) comes up [whenever](http://www.jobsforher.com/2015/04/why-are-indian-mothers-leaving-the-workforce/) someone wants to write about [Indian women](https://www.quora.com/topic/Indian-Women) or [their safety.](http://www.amity.edu/PressClippings/PressDetails.asp?id=6708)

So now pretty convinced that Gauri Desai was fake, I did a reverse image search on the others. Some of the results are hilarious, and others just sad.

""Leela Thakur"" is actually [Myleeta Aga,](http://www.adgully.com/exclusive-up-and-close-with-bbc-worldwide-s-myleeta-aga-60254.html) head of BBC's India Business.

""Suresh Kakkar"" is [a blog writer, Dave.](http://shortsforwinter.com/hiking-hunt-lake-trail-whiteshell-provincial-park-manitoba/) (Scroll down for the selfie)

""Rahul's"" photo was taken from an [engagement album.](http://adeptweddingphotography.com/wedding-blog/indian-engagement-party-photography-fort-lauderdale/)

""Anil"" is a [stock photo.](http://www.istockphoto.com/photo/cheerful-young-indian-couple-male-female-embrace-isolated-on-white-3861844)

""Rashmi Pande"" is actually [Harjinder, who migrated to Canada 20 years ago.] (https://diversevoices.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/portrait-11-harjinde-2/) A short interview of hers is on the site, and that's quite interesting.

If the photos are fake and so poorly chosen, I'm pretty sure the testimonials are fake too. I definitely don't trust these guys enough to send someone to my home.

[askindia] Am I really thinking wild? Confused. [career help],20,7gdwwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7gdwwd/askindia_am_i_really_thinking_wild_confused/,7,1511996989.0,"I'm a 27 guy and currently working in a hectic job in a small town away from a big city with no like minded people around me or even friends to hang out. I'm stressed and with a lot of thoughts in my mind. One thought/idea ain't letting me sleep these days. I want to start a photography based business in a nearby big city. I've been in love for photography but since I've started working, I hardly get time. Don't have any like minded people around me, or even if, can't give much time. I've had a small business earlier which was unsuccessful but learnt a lot during college time. Now working for a year has got me a hang of how to deal with people, manage them, get results. 

Now coming back to my idea of photography and filmmaking business, it ain't any disruptive business but something I've loved. I have a small portfolio which ain't much impressive, not of any models in the photos but general landscape, street and travel. I don't intend to be the next fashion photographer either. So the idea is leave this work, get to the nearby city, start a photography firm with initially teaching the basics and advance of photography, not the costly ones but even college students which can afford. Side by side, also lectures from the well knowns in the field who might help me get some traction along with what I've been doing. I plan to get some amount of initial money from home for this. Pick up a few students, with some contacts, get some photography paid jobs. Get those students paid with some margin for me, get more contacts and  follow it up. The jobs I tend to initially get are concerts, photoshoots and even weddings. Photography instruments and cameras can be rented. A lot of things I feel I can do. 

But now the only fear is jumping out of my well paying hectic job at this age for something like this. How much harm will it do to my career if I fail out and if I want to go back to my work life again? How do I see the future when this field is jam packed with every photographer and film maker out there. I don't plan to bring anything different in photography but satisfied clients, good photographs and create a team which can deliver this with me. This all as happiness in what I will do and something belonging to me. 

I also thought of doing this after trying out for mba, as it might give me a cushion. Maybe help me out. But again confusing.

So how wild is this? I need some sane suggestions here, haven't asked my family or friends. 

I've not edited any part of this text, just raw, straight out of my confused mind. Please be gentle, already stressed and confused about all directions in career.

tl;dr: 27yo guy, hectic job, wants to leave for starting a photography business with not much experience and not a disruptive business but something just for happiness. Confused guy.",8

Indian multimedia is horrendous.,105,560z3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/560z3n/indian_multimedia_is_horrendous/,40,1475720860.0,"So I'm part of an multimedia help group. We volunteer, helping people from all over the world with various software, but mostly Photoshop. People will post their images or animations and ask for help or feedback which we assist with. 

Now I've been doing this for more than 8 years and I'm educated in art and multimedia design, and classically trained in print advertising. I'm also a graphic designer. So I know what I'm doing and I know what I'm talking about, as do the other volunteers. 

Now, India. Whenever we get an upload from India it's almost always a case of the following:

1. The work is terrible. Over use of vignette, blur, exposure, saturation. 
2. It's a ridiculous portrait. For example, some guy sitting on the roof of a Ferrari. 
3. It's almost always men of various ages working on images of themselves. Really over-acted poses and stares. Just, shit really, no matter how it's analysed. 
4. Despite the fact that it's a helping forum with clear instructions to post AND ask your questions, Indian work is NEVER posted up with any questions. It's just posted and left like, *""Look at my awesome work!""*

Now I'm not biased or racist or generalising and if you think I am, I couldn't give a shit. This is based on 8 years of experience and the simple, statistical reality of almost all posts that come in to our site from India. No other country's people act this way on our site. Every one else mostly posts reasonably good work of general artistic topics and asks for help on some level. Not Indians. It's always vain, childish trash that none of us volunteers can even begin to understand, and when we offer feedback (which is usually not positive but always polite) we meet incredible resistance. Like how dare we critique work and offer suggestions to work that is posted to our free art critiquing website? It's not a gallery. It's a help and critique site made very clear by all the comments and critique publicly displayed, **as well as** the rules stated upon posting. 

Even if you look at our collective ban list right now. 248 people banned in 8 years. 233 of them registered as being from India. 

So what's up with this, India? How do I better understand what's going on here? How do I help you to help yourselves? Why is your art and photography so self-centred, vain, and forgive me, just plain terrible, and why won't you listen to **free**, professional advice on a free, professional advice website that **you came to**?",8

Firstly, all my flights are booked. This isn't a ""is it safe"" thread :) I am well aware of the dangers and scams. I have done and am doing my research. I know what to wear etc. Thanks for your concern!



I'm flying into New Delhi on the 19th of October, staying for one night then probably heading off to Jaipur the next day. I would rather avoid going to Agra, and want to get out of Delhi ASAP so i'm going to skip the Taj/Save it for next time.




Im hoping to head to Pushkar after that, and then off to Udaipur and Jodhpur, after that I have no sort of sense of where to go next. I want to go in the general direction of the south (Goa, Kerala etc.) I'm hoping to spend 3-4 months travelling around. I should have $2000-2500 AUD to spend (100,488 - 125,606 Rupees) maybe even more. Any advice on time I should spend in certain cities etc. would be greatly appreciated. Im really into photography and video. Really keen on going to markets, trying lots of food, buying clothes, seeing some awesome architecture etc.



Would like some recommendations on: - Doing classes, yoga, massage, cooking etc. where to do them - Buying clothes, places to avoid or places to 'save space' for - Activities (like camel ride in Jaisalmer, which I probably wont be doing this time)



I want to know how to go about money; Should I get out a large amount before I go? Use my card? Are there many ATM's around? Whats a good system to have to avoid getting my money stolen.



Any other advice or anything would be cool. Also if you're going to be in Rajasthan around the same time let me know!

Kota District Collector's letter to the parents of IIT aspirants [NP],183,4i91ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4i91ig/kota_district_collectors_letter_to_the_parents_of/,40,1462632239.0,"Dear Parents,

On behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.

My humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.

It is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.

It is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.

When parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.

Good career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.

There is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one’s child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.

However, I think we all agree that the world too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.

Art, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.

Many of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.

Well, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.

It is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.

Even if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.

However, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child… Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.

I consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

Am I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?

I am sorry. Answer is No… They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

A Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children… Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.

Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth. Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like. One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste. Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents. Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.

All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do.

As they say “Tip of the Iceberg” reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.

Many Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don’t mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for. That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts… your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness.

In return, what the child got was threats of performing still better…psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family. comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors…could be anyone) sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child’ s performance.

We need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times. So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit. I need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them. So the question I tend to hear from you is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways? Not necessarily.

Well let us try to see what all good things they resisted… Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.

Child actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly. Moreover, there is one thing which is certain… Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so..Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so.

They tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful…In case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you.

It may appear strange and extremely annoying… But there is a possibility of your child not liking you… This comes in many forms and shades. Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have…) etc.

So, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?

Answer again is a big No.. Your child does not dislike you… I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo…

Children are parents’ responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so… Parents really think good for their children’s future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good… what is successful… what is the best thing… Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of…

We all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.

I am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in “Right Child Care Practices” and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.

Creating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.
Understanding the needs of the children. There are two extremes in this case…Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise “Your” dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care… Both of them definitely do not work.

Take time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times…Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher.

Allow the child “to be” on his own terms and here I mean especially the child’s engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative. Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.

Spend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the timeâ€¦. It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child. Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him. We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.

Just a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise “Your Dreams” at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises “His/Her” Dreams?

I could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.

Nothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others. Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you.

Be the Best Parent in the World!!!!
I am sure there is no competition there

How do you deal with your friends/relatives who ask you do to something for them just because you are good at it professionally/amateurishly & asking you is cheaper option then hiring someone other professional ?,38,5lsibx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5lsibx/how_do_you_deal_with_your_friendsrelatives_who/,19,1483486475.0,"For instance, I have been asked to do photography at an event by a friend of mine, but I dont want to do since if I shoot I wont get time to enjoy.I suggested some other names but he wants me since apparently likes my photography.

[RANT] Reservation Quotas.,114,3afiny,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3afiny/rant_reservation_quotas/,129,1434767963.0,"Everyday I wake up and regret being born in this country. I gave 3 competitive exams this year for different colleges. I was not selected in any of them. It's okay. I accept it.

Here's the part that grinds my gears. Reservation category. People getting selected on the basis of what their caste is  plain ridiculousness. Let me tell you these competitive exams were design aptitude and Film desgin (Specific area). I know a guy who got selected in a  college, he didn't even know what WHITE BALANCE in camera was until I told him (this was after 2 days of result declaration in which he was selected). The douche has Canon 5Dmark3. ""Photu me background blur ho raha hai, bc FB pe photography page kholo"" type dude. His father is super rich. Owns a jewelery shop.

Reservation quota does injustice with someone who knows better than the aforementioned prick. I am not saying I deserved that seat but.....fuck it man, this all just makes me super sad in general about India. 

Government sectors are not top notch as they should be because pile of reserved pricks got through who were only better taking bribes but nothing else. 

I am going to give entrance for FTII this year. In total 10 seats. In which 5 seats are reserved. Let's see how it goes for me. Considering the current situation at FTII with all the protests and all, this year too there will be no intake, a zero year. If this happens another slap to India's body of work. 2nd consecutive Zero year it will be in FTII.

EDIT:- Hey, I also get the part where I didn't get the seat in unreserved category. I get it. I also accept it. But the 'whining like a little bitch' as some of you are calling is because of the stupid system. That prick with canon 5dmark3 didn't deserved that seat. Bas bc. He said ""jo photu me blur hota hai"" which is  ""SHadow depth of field"" makes me sad.

We are really into our photography and filmmaking and was wandering if there's any restrictions around bringing drones to India and flying them in India.

I've read few articles online saying it is illegal to fly drones in India, and you will lose your drone if you get caught. In some cases you might not even make it past the customs at the airport. Just wanted to find out more about this topic before our trip in August.

Title +

I am a beginner who has never owned or used a telescope before but since last couple of months, I am planning to buy one. My main objective for initial 6-7 months is learning and observing only. I am not into astro-photography as of now, however a couple of moon-shots or Jupiter-shots won't be bad thing. And for that, I am planning to buy a camera attachment accessory too(or whatever it is called). I have read some of the buying guide blogs but frankly speaking, apart from aperture and zoom level, I am not sure which one will be good for my usage. My budget is ~15k and I have these models in my mind: Celestron 114EQ (Rs. 15k), 127EQ (Rs. 17k), 70AZ (Rs 13k), 114EQ (15k).


Cannot visit Tejraj shop Mumbai as I am based in some other state, so above prices are from amazon.in.

>When DC contacted Kanathur inspector P. Asokan in connection with the suicide, he brushed aside the whole incident down saying that the student committed suicide due to ‘love failure’ or a failed relationship.

this is false story. JT had no love failure. in fact he was happy in his own way and never mentioned any relationship issues in our day to day talks. all of jt's friends knew what he was going through at the hands of the principal, A.venugopal (aka hitler of AMET). this is not the first time this man has mistreated students. he was the principal of the department of marine engineering for decades and he exercised his reign of terror relentlessly often threatening students having disciplinary issues with termination of their well earned placements and other job offers as well as personaly humiliating their parents in front of other college officials. he was a fanatic who wanted all his students to be mute slaves who will never raise their voice against him or his actions. there is a limit for a student to tolerate the negativity. the principal was a man who felt no remorse for his actions. it is extremely saddening to realize that a life of a student had to be taken for everyone to question mr. venugopal's authority. in his death note JT singh clearly specified his name and hoped that no one would fall victim to this man's brutality ever again. 

jt singh was a passionate photographer and a talented speaker. he was a man of will and there was always purpose in whatever he did. it is agonizing to know that he is with us no more. we all miss you JT!! i hope nobody will ever have to go through what you went through.

My fiance(French Canadian) and I(Fiji born, US citizen, Hindu, Indian ethnicity) are planning to get married in India. From what I have figured our so far, legal formalities will take too long so we plan to do that part once we are back in the US/Canada.

What we are left with is planning a small wedding ceremony for us. By small I mean small; the 2 of us and 2 photography/videography friends, plus a pundit.

We want to have the wedding in outdoors in nature. Thinking Triund hill, which is a hike not too far away from McLeodganj.

Now here are my questions; neither of us live there so we are wondering how we can go about planning this?

Would it be possible to find a pundit that would be willing to do the ceremony for a mixed religion couple? We would like if we could get the ceremony explained to us, the significance and such. I speak Hindi, but would love it we could have an English translation for my fiance. 

Then comes the whole issue where exactly we can get the wedding performed. Does it have to be at a mandir? Do need certain things? A mandap?

If any of you do have any experience, please do chime in.

I'm 27/M and have been victim to anxiety and depression for about 2-3 years. Today, after a short bout of anxiety after hearing a certain song that made me feel like my life has become really hollow (which in turn led to the anxiety), I decided it was time I visit a psychiatrist. So I did. After I told him about my problems, one of the first questions he asked me was whether I smoked weed. I said I did. He said weed throws many in depression and anxiety (and I agree with him to an extent, for I feel like weed's made me very sensitive to certain things, in spite of having helped me in my creative work immensely). After 30-40 minutes of consultation, he prescribed me Venpad XR (venlafaxine) and suggested I take a 75mg/day dose for the first 6 days and then increase the dose to about 150mg/day for another 5 days and 225mg/day till the end of one month. He also suggested that I quit weed as soon as possible.

1. I've read that venlafaxine is a strong drug that can give you intense side effects - like insomnia, nausea, loss of sex drive, motherfucker headaches, etc. Can someone here (who might have used the medication to treat anxiety and depression) comment? 

2. I'm a big fan of weed. Like I said, it's helped me massively in all my writing, photography and art. It's also helped me appreciate music, cinema and literature more. But its also at the same time made me more prone to getting emotionally affected by false hopes for my future or by better memories from my past (which actually make me feel terribly low, for they're gone and I don't now have the life I once had). Can venlafaxine be taken along with weed or it's not recommended?

3. I'm at the moment in the middle of a very important project that will go on for at least a few more months (maybe till Feb/Mar). In this case, would it be recommended for me to take the prescribed meds or wait till the project gets over and then give 1-2 months' time to the meds to work their effect?

Thank you.",8
Career without college?,3,5ru7uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ru7uw/career_without_college/,4,1486161119.0,"Hey friends, I am 23 years old guy, don't have a bachelors degree yet, I am in my 3rd college but feeling depressed again and don't want to study anymore. This time I am not even failing like past two colleges, I just have zero motivation to do college work be it assignments or study. I am not dumb or anything. I just have mental illness - Bipolar - Cyclothymia, due to this I go through periods of depression and mania, regardless of what is going on in my life. That means I feel depressed and/or happy for no outside reason, but because of the malfunctioning of my brain. I have been diagnosed since I was 17. And have to take 10 tablets everyday. One thing that I realized over the years was that stress plays a major role in my illness. When there is zero stress, I am a very normal person, and in times of huge stress I have started to get suspicious of people around me, feeling that they are trying to harm me - which is a sign of delusion.

I don't like asking my parents for money any more. And want to start my career, my own way, my mental health would dictate my lifestyle and my career.

What are other ways by which I could have a career without college education?

I have been great with computer since I was a little kid, so I am looking into free lance web-development.

I also love photoshop and can do it for hours without break, so I am learning that as well.

I also entertain the idea of starting some small scale business, but that would require capital in almost every case, for which I would have to do minimum wage paying job for a year or so, and save, which I am willing to do. Just have to suck it up for a year, no big deal.

What else do you guys suggest?

A friend of mine has suggested me freelance photography. I have been playing with that idea, it involves photoshop, which would also come handy in web development. IDK

So what do you guys suggest?

TY! :)",8

Northern India trip advice & meet-up [AskIndia],1,6hoplk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6hoplk/northern_india_trip_advice_meetup_askindia/,0,1497669518.0,"I am a photographer, and planning to document Northern India. During our stay in India, I will be making a photography series that focuses on the local Indian life. 
To do this, I would like to meet up with locals who are willing to hang out with us, and get us in contact with the right people for documenting these photographs.

I am traveling through northern India from June 26th till July 25th. Two friends will accompany me along the way. 

I already have planned the trip, but I would like some advice from people who live in these regions:


27th of June till 29th of June: Delhi

   - In Delhi I would like to see the Old Delhi, document street 
      life and maybe see a procession or a fair, if there is an 
      opportunity.
   --- Then we will take the train to Haridwar, and the bus to Rishikesh

29th of June till 3rd of July: Rishikesh (3 days)

   - Here we would like to experience the street life and visit Jim 
     Corbett national park
   ---  Sleeper Train from Haridwar to Varanasi

3 to 6 July: Varanasi (4days)

   - Things that I'd certainly like to do: participate in a private cremation ceremony and document the 
      whole happening, meet Aghori and Sadhu to make portraits
   --- Sleeper train to Agra

7 to 9 July:  Agra (2 days)

   --- train to Jaipur

9 to 12 July:  Jaipur (4days)

   - In Rajahstan is where I'd like to spend the most amount of time, because I would like to document the 
     following things:
           - Meet and get familiar with a camel herder, so I can make portraits and documentary photographs
           - Meet Cobra gypsies and also get familiar with them
   --- Go to Pushkar by car or camel/horseback if possible 

13 to 16 July: Pushkar (4days)

   --- Go to Jodhpur also by car/horseback if possible

17 to 21 July: Jodhpur (4days)

   --- Take the sleeper train to New Delhi

22 to 25 July:  New Delhi until we leave


Please, let me know your thoughts on this trip, and time management.
Also if you know of other interesting things, which are not touristy but really typical local, let me know, I'd love to do that.

A trip to a forest in Assam and also a drinking party with the wild rhinos. Pictures inside.,22,1xifz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1xifz5/a_trip_to_a_forest_in_assam_and_also_a_drinking/,25,1392059813.0,"I am not into photography, so excuse my poor skills.

http://imgur.com/a/4CvwA

I do not like drinking in a bar, for me drinks are best enjoyed in the wilds with friends. I have been making such trips to nearby forests and wild life sanctuaries with my friends for many years. The photos you see are from a trip few weeks ago.

This trip was to Pobitara wild life sanctuary and nearby forests. Pobitara is about 40 Kilometers from Guwahati. It has been our favorite drinking spot for many years after the other spots became too mainstream and started attracting too many tourists.

Even the trip to the sanctuary is a pleasure in itself. A major part of the way lies through wild , lush green forests. There is almost no traffic and you will hardly see any human for long stretches.

Edges of the forests has started to become popular as picnic spots and it saddened me to find plastic wrappers, packets, empty bottles of whisky etc strewn everywhere. Fortunately, people avoid going inside the forest since vehicles cant go in. 

Pobitara has shrunken from it's former size and now an embankment with a kuttcha road on top separates the animal from human settlements and agricultural fields nearby.

There is a semi abandoned observation post/fishing post overlooking the sanctuary, which is our favorite drinking spot. Stand on it, and you will feel awed with the open expanse of the flood plain.  There are herds of wild buffaloes, barking deers, rhinos , birds grazing peacefully. Here the wind blows hard.

You normally, cant walk into the sanctuary since there are innumerable muddy ponds green with water lily and hyacinths, home to the migratory birds.

We open our bottles and the party is on the way. We make it a rule not to leave any refuse or play any loud music. The animals were downwind and the smell of food and humans spooked a herd of wild buffaloes. Magnificient beasts with huge horns. They are quite aggressive and it is better to maintain distance. There were rhinos all around us, including a mother and child.

And as happens in such parties, one of us wanted to climb down the embankment and visit the animals up close. We climbed down, found a dry strip of land and made our way to the animals. Some one has dug in fishing nets to catch fish from those shallow natural ponds.

The leader of a wild buffalo herd who was bathing in the mud, rose up and showed us his displeasure by striking the ground. We stopped and stepped back slowly. Sat down and drank some more. Suddenly the herd started moving away and we discovered the source of disturbance at edge of a cluster of trees. A leopard, eyeing some domestic cattle that has probably strayed in to the sanctuary. You could hardly make out the leopard due to his excellent camouflage. Regal beast, sitting on his paws with his head on the ground looking ahead.

2. I'm 29 so by the time I complete training + 2000 hours I might be 31 or 32. Is it too late already?
3. Is it easier to find a job internationally? I make about €7000 a month but with a job in Emirates or likes of it, I might make about €8000 or more with the cost of an abnormal work schedule?
4. Also, is it worth it financially? I think I might spend €100k to receive a slight bump on my salary.

Finally, I'll leave you all with a quote from A Song of Ice and Fire which reminds me about the partition, and what a tragedy it was, and how we can all strive to do better, and love each other as the brothers and sisters we really are:

>“It all goes back and back,"" Tyrion thought, ""to our mothers and fathers and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance in our steads.”

Let's not be puppets. Let's love and share and break the cycle that has been handed down to us.

At the outset, I would like to tell you why I am doing this AMA. This young man /u/kumbhakaran (*I wonder why but he prefers not to be named*) who works with me and helps me with my legislative work requested me to do this. I agreed. 

After hearing about this AMA format of interaction, I thought it would be a good way to know what people think of the present situation in India. Your questions might be a link to finding solutions to issues that are uppermost in the minds of people of a certain creed. 

Being selfish, I would like to use these inputs sometime in Parliament. I am not sure how this could help improve the overall situation (or solve problems) but Reddit could prove to be an alternative communication channel for me. I am not on Twitter or Facebook. I like the anonymity that Reddit offers. Therefore I have dared to do this AMA here.

My policy team, /u/kumbhakaran and /u/ZainabHameed, will be helping me with this AMA. They will also participate and respond.

**BIG DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this AMA should definitely not be attributed to those of my party and leadership. I am answering these questions as a citizen of India. All views expressed here are personal. Same goes for my staff.**

So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india community. 

*I will start answering questions at 7 pm (IST).*

EDIT (20:01 IST): Thank you Redditors for participating in my AMA and a special thank you to the moderators. If some of you still have queries, please do post them. I will try to answer them sometime during this week. Don't be surprised if you find me as a regular Redditor after this. Amen!

EDIT (19:53 IST, March 20, 2015): I got some brilliant points from Redditors regarding the plight of the farming sector. Yesterday, I had allotted the time of the BJD to a colleague who unfortunately, did not use them. I spoke today (limited party time) and used some of the points in the House. /u/kumbhakaran has uploaded the video already! After a not so busy week in parliament, let me try answering a few more questions.

Greetings [/r/India](https://www.reddit.com/r/India)!

Tomorrow, August 24, marks the first anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision on the Right to Privacy judgement. This marked an important point for the conversation around what it means to be free. To love, to share and to learn. Privacy makes a lot of this possible. An essential part of a privacy right is to ensure India gets a law that protects people from the harmful use of digital technologies that profile and surveil them. One of the efforts to make sure this legal reform takes place is the SaveOurPrivacy campaign which has proposed a model law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 that is open for feedback and comment. Some of the lawyers and policy experts will join the Reddit community today between 6:30 - 7:30 IST to chat on not only this campaign but reflect in the broader privacy issues including the social media communication hub, mass CCTV deployment, Cambridge Analytica.

If you have privacy badger installed on your browser, show up. If you use duckduckgo, show up. If you didn't link your Aadhaar to anything, show up. If you worry about strong encryption preventing law enforcement agencies from doing their work, show up!

Collectively, we are the #SaveOurPrivacy drafting volunteers. Our twitter handles are below.

Hey /r/India,  
**Rahul Yadav** has agreed for an AMA session with us. He's been in the headlines quite a lot recently, and has even been coined as the ""*monk who sold his Ferrari*"" by a [few media outlets](http://www.firstpost.com/business/rahul-yadav-really-monk-sold-ferrari-decoding-housing-com-ceos-rs-200-cr-gift-employees-2243666.html).  

So get your questions ready and let's have an interesting AMA here on /r/india. Please keep in mind that it will be [R]eddiquette enforced so we will be moderating to ensure civility. 

**Bio:**

>Rahul hails from Alwar, Rajasthan where he received his primary education. He later went to IIT Bombay for higher studies, where he created a question bank from old exam papers to build the popular Exambaba.com. Exambaba was made the official IIT-B archive before eventually being shut down. After a brief internship in Israel, Yadav returned to build apps for Google Chrome. And then, in his final year, dropped out of IIT. Later, he joined his friends to co-found Housing.com.

**Date & Time:** May 19^th, Tuesday, 6PM IST.

Our folks have finally met, and contrary to the usual drama one would expect, everything went well and our families are genuinely happy for us. We tie the knot by year end. 
 
Her father's English is fine, but her mother really doesn't speak the language (appreciate the effort though) - mostly unintelligible. Still, I translated where needed and filled in the blanks.

All the while waifu-to-be was a wee bit nervous with the whole interaction scene, but it turned out to be a lovely evening. They've traveled a long way and I was joking how the roles have reversed in contrast with traditional Indian norms where the prospect groom is expected to visit the bride and her family.
 
Mom had seen her photos on my Facebook, but was overly impressed with her skin and hair in person, to the point I had to ask her to tone it down a bit with the awkward complements. My dad and her dad got into conversations around food and a bunch of other stuff. 
 
I guess I'm writing this because it's a bit surreal how smooth everything has been. Her folks had zero issues with their daughter dating a gaijin, maybe because they knew where I worked, and my folks are just happy I didn't turn out to be gay (they had suspected so for a while on extremely silly grounds). Had it been an Indian partner, I don't think it would have been this straightforward.

Anyway, I'm tired and will crash, but feel free to ask me anything about Japan, work and life there, partners and dating etc.

Just want to make a note that we're very low-key, sober and laidback as a couple. She does not look like a dolled up AV model, I do not look like Tom Cruise's Indian cousin, and we're both quite career minded. So please don't ask questions like it's r/indiansgonewild.

Will answer starting morning. Cheers.",9

I recently emmigrated from India. AMA.,17,9dkov2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9dkov2/i_recently_emmigrated_from_india_ama/,46,1536282540.0,"I spent a majority of my childhood outside India in the middle east. I returned to India roughly 20 years ago. I had fully settled in to India. I didn't quite miss anything from the middle east barring the food and stable electricity :P 

I had a choice to make about 10 years ago, to move out of India and I chose not to. Mostly because my friend circle, my gf, and most of my family was in India at the time. I found a job in a great company that kickstarted my career fairly well. 


Due in part to my own existential crisis, due in part to a change in outlook around 6 years ago(post MBA) and due in part to everything that has been happening in the country for the last few years, I gradually started finding living in the country to be unbearable. This is not an anti-BJP post by any means. I've never been political and I do not see myself ever being. I do have ideologies which at the very core is ""Live and let live""....or to be blunt....Unfortunately and I'm sure a lot of you agree, the Indian society simply isn't going to let you do that. Its not that I was living a loud/flamboyant life. Its that even the simple life I tried to live was being threatened in several ways. 

This group, r/india though often negative in tone has also helped open my eyes to a lot of things. This discourse is important, if for nothing else, as an outlet for folks who are frustrated. For folks to empathize and sympathize.

At this point, we begin a change in tone...........

I saw my friends, colleagues and classmates gradually all leave the country. Some of them left around 8-10 years ago. None of them show a genuine interest in returning. But this didn't really bother me. I still had a great friends circle and I've always been exceptionally great and keeping in touch with my friends and meeting them every chance I get. Nothing was changing my mind that I needed to move out. 

But one day, something just snapped. I spoke to a friend of mine over dinner. She was a classmate from college. She had been working with a firm in Australia. See the thing is, she and I never spoke in college but we just knew each other. I saw on fb that she was in town, we got chatting and decided to meet up. She was asking why I don't look for opportunities abroad. I said I never felt that things are necessarily that much better there. She said she could potentially find me a job. 

I found out that she and I were in similar industries. She was earning(post-conversion) around 60L more than me. I told her that really doesn't matter given living costs. She told me she 'saves' roughly 20 LPA. And believe me, she's not someone who tries to save. This was a time when I was commuting about 90 minutes one way to work. 8km. She travels 20 minutes to work and can afford to stay away from the central/expensive parts of the city due to great public transport. 

She lives a healthy and fun life. Has co-workers who know to stick to their boundaries. Has no one bother her about what she wears, who she's with, what she eats etc. I couldn't find a single objective measure, to counter her with. 

I made it my life's mission to find out for myself whether this was all truly the case. So I started looking out. Thankfully, my wife was offered a perfectly timed transfer to a western country for 2 years and that came with a Visa for me as well. And so I took the leap. Found myself a job before I landed here. 

Its been a few months now and I've finally seen what this other side is like today. This is an abrupt end to this post but that's because there's too much to write if I explained everything else.

So feel free now to ask me anything you want about my thoughts/experiences.

Peri vs Pony. The whole IIPM fake MBA school scandal in short.,136,4c8hwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4c8hwh/peri_vs_pony_the_whole_iipm_fake_mba_school/,41,1459162765.0,"Yesterday, The Telegraph published an [article on the IIPM](http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160327/jsp/7days/story_76563.jsp). It contains quotes from both Arindham Chaudhary (Pony) and Maheshwar Peri, the guy who published some articles about him, got censored, and sued. I am posting the quotes here and also other notable links. 

**Summary of events**       

* 2008: Maheshwar Peri writes an article ""[Racket Game Lobs](http://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/racket-game-lobs/237792)"" for Outlook. [Got sued](http://www.iltb.net/2013/02/going-by-precedent/).

* 8 October 2010: Cases under Uttarakhand HC quashed.
* February 2011: Caravan published an article on IIPM: [Sweet Smell of Success](http://web.archive.org/web/20110130135253/http://caravanmagazine.in/Story.aspx?Storyid=717&StoryStyle=FullStory)
* February 2013: [Websites containing negative articles about IIPM censored](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/roausYEth9b0TvZv4r0whN/Govt-orders-blocking-of-IIPMrelated-URLs.html). 73 URLs blocked.  Peri and Pony appear in a [TV debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHCnxIPWAu8).

In most cases, multiple lawsuits were filed in varied jurisdictions. Damages sought were up to INR 100 crore. 

###Quotes

**Arindham Chaudhary (Pony)**

* *""There is an incredible conspiracy by people to pull me down.""*
* *""But IIPM doesn’t define my existence. I don’t earn my bread and butter from IIPM. IIPM is my passion.""* He has several other firms.
* On Modi, *""He has fabulous leadership qualities. I hate religion per se but I supported Modi openly.""* The Sunday Indian, edited by him, carried a cover-story about Rahul Gandhi in 2006 when it was launched. The recent re-launch issue carries a cover story about Modi. [Najma Heptulla](http://businesswireindia.com/news/news-details/power-brands-2016-launched-along-with-new-look-version-sunday-indian/47940) and some other BJP leaders were present at the relaunch.

**Maheshwar Peri**

* On why he didn't publicly announce his win, *""I didn't want the spotlight on me, or a larger-than-life projection. In fact, I wanted to contain myself.""*
* *""Financially, I had to spend in high eight figures. Personally, it did affect me. I will not lie. There were days when I couldn't sleep, days when I didn't have an idea how we would sustain the company, days when my wife and I discussed the shape our life was taking. But every time I met a young person cheated by IIPM, I felt that this was a battle I had to fight.""*
* *""In the five years after we started the battle, 12,000-15,000 students enrolled in IIPM courses had to go through the pain. I may have won the battle but, during this, thousands of students lost out. That's not a nice feeling.""*
* *""I knew that this house of cards would come crashing down if I kept up the fight.""*
* Peri has never met Pony but they used to text, *""There was communication between us. It wasn't that he was an enemy. But I was clear that there would be no settlement outside the court.""*
* On why he never settled, *""It is like Pakistan promising us that there will be no terrorism in Kashmir. Just give us Kashmir. Is that a compromise? There was no question of a settlement as there was nothing wrong on my side. In most cases, if there is a compromise, it means both sides are wrong in some way or the other. In my case, we had done nothing wrong.""*

"AMA : I orchestrated a protest against an impossible force(corrupt businessmen,media, politicians & police) for justice in India and won. It changed the system in an entire state. This post is meant to be a guide for whistleblowers on ""How to run a successful campaign in India as an ordinary person""",552,8gziej,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8gziej/ama_i_orchestrated_a_protest_against_an/,79,1525471683.0,"Last year, I had made a [post on this very subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/) asking your help to fight against injustice. I was a desperate person at that time and didn't think that there is any chance that it will be successful. After writing that post, I unknowingly became the mastermind behind a protest against corrupt college administrators, corrupt police officers and the media which would refuse to listen to us because they were getting money from these corrupt people.

This incident involves the torture and the death of a student caused by the college management, bribing the police and media to keep quiet, several months of protests which bloomed into a state-wide-unrest forcing the politicians to change sides, arrest & imprisonment of the absconding chairman of a college, vice principal, owners etc and finally the reform of the education system of an entire state! And, I was the one who orchestrated the protest which resulted in all of this. I spent every conscious hour of two months of my life working behind this campaign.

I dont want to repeat the entire incident, so you can read about the incident in detail in it's well written [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehru_College_of_Engineering_and_Research_Centre). Make sure to read about the student death controversy and then the police report which is below under different subsection. Also you can go through my old posts in this subreddit like [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/) and [this photo](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5niiw4/this_is_not_saudi_arabia_they_are_not_muslims/)

I am making this AskMeAnything so that my experience can help people who think ""I am just an ordinary person, I can't change the system, I can't protest against injustice."" or ""They are rich and corrupt, so there is no way to bring them to justice, so I should better move on with my life and do nothing"" or ""All the problems is due to the current system/government and I can't do anything about it"".

I was a no one in this incident. I didn't know the victim. I was not even a student of that college at that time. I was an ex-student. I had no ""benefit"" in doing any of this. Also, I did all of it anonymously. No one except about 5 friends know that I was working behind the scenes. 

Also, my major contribution was in directing the protest, contacting the right people, managing the information and running the campaign. I did majority of it by just sitting in a room with a laptop. There were hundreds of other brave people who staged the protest and did the things which I wanted to be done.

I didn't start out thinking I will coordinate this protest or spend so much time on it. This all started out when I started a Facebook page asking justice for the victim. I regularly posted new content and people started contacting me with new information or asking me what they should do. Within few days, I was having so much contact with so many people from various backgrounds like students, teachers, reporters, lawyers, ex-students, parents etc that I unknowingly became the one who was running the entire campaign both online and offline.

So many people selflessly helped in finding information. Some law students of other colleges volunteered to write legal notices or other such stuff. Some people traveled great distances to find certain information. Some people had contacts with politicians and was able to mobilize partymen. Some brought in media. Some were reporters who were directly taking content from me and posting it. Some were helping in the creation of the content. And, I had to ensure that the content I was providing is true.

After about a month of work, it started showing signs of success. We started to get the attention of mainstream media who started posting the full details without censoring anything. Then, few weeks later, this became the headline news of all the newspapers in the state. It became the talk of the town. I overheard so many people discussing about this incident while travelling in trains or buses.

Then, student protests broke out at many private colleges across the state demanding student unions and fighting against injustices. Few colleges even lost their affiliation and closed down due to this incident. And, students of one such engineering college was transferred to better colleges. My friends and relatives at several other colleges said that the situation has improved after this incident.

Apart from the weed smoking and Pink Floyd referencing, I really enjoyed reading the questions and answers that you guys put forward. Thank you for that. And I must tell you that sir really enjoyed interacting with you.

Taking the conversation forward, I would like to hear your thoughts about how Reddit India can be used as a platform to get policy inputs for Parliament. 

To start with, I will try to get more [LAMP](http://lamp.prsindia.org/thefellowship) like me on board. Our parent organization, [PRS Legislative Research](http://www.prsindia.org/), can also be involved. I cannot give any guarantees here but I will try my best to convince 'influential people' to get on board. On a personal note, I will be putting up regular self-posts to get inputs from the Reddit Community for sir. He has approved of this and he said he will also try to participate in these discussions when time permits.

Do let me know what you think. I believe this could prove to be a game changer for public participation in policy.

EDIT: People please! Don't mean to be rude, but I didn't come here hunting for praise about my boss or me. I really want to hear your thoughts about how to formalize this initiative.
Once I get the inputs from this community, I can take the conversation forward with other people outside this forum. And I want make some headway before Parliament goes into recess.

Mods, please help me out here and give some ideas?

1) Can we have a special Policy section?

2) Flairs for people working in policy? 

I can't think of much because I haven't handled subreddits at all. Ideas please!

Hey /r/India,

A little while back in an AMA request thread /u/lazyass_tiger suggested Chang. We reached out to Chang and he was awesome enough to agree! Here is the verification image: http://i.imgur.com/e4TebDE.jpg

Chang is one of the very few Indians who are of Chinese origin. Despite the disadvantage that people with Mongolian/North Eastern features have to face on a visual medium like TV/Movies, he has managed to overcome the stereotyping to a large extent and has done mainstream TV/Bollywood work. 

In case you haven't had a chance to see his work, here is a clip from Indian Idol, the show which made him a household name:

> http://youtu.be/PcILrWSrpNE

Chang made his big screen debut in Yash Raj Film's Badmaash Cmpany alongside actors Shahid Kapoor and Anushka Sharma. He has hosted numerous TV shows like, Indian Idol, Indian Premier League, IIfa Awards, India's Got Talent etc. I got to know today that he will be playing an important character in the much awaited film [Detective Byomkesh Bakshy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Byomkesh_Bakshy!)

Besides music and movies Chang is an adventurous traveller where he indulges in sky diving, quad bike racing, shark cage diving and similar escapades. He is an avid reader, experimental foodie and sketches in his leisure time. He is an extremely talented self-made individual and we are sure that you will enjoy this interaction.

'Although a trained Engineer, Suneel received a Diploma in Filmmaking (Writing and Direction) from the Prague Film School. After working in the direction department on Prakash Raj’s directorial debut NAANU NANNA KANASU, he became an Assistant Director on B Suresha’s National Award winning PUTTAKKANA HIGHWAY.  A few short films later, Suneel took the first step towards feature filmmaking with PUTA TIRUGISI NODU.'

2.) Which contemporary filmmaker do you admire? (Indian and Foreign)

3.) Would you say you have a particular 'style' of direction, or is each film unique in 'style'?

4.) How did you first start working in films? What was it like, and how is it different from right now?

5.) What would you want to say to filmmakers who are just making their first film? What do you expect of them, and what do would you want to see?



EDIT:

He said he is boarding a flight, and will get back to this after. In the meantime, he answered some of my questions on twitter, and here are there answers :)

A - Black Friday and Ugly

2.) Which contemporary filmmaker do you admire? (Indian and Foreign)

5.) What would you want to say to filmmakers who are just making their first film? What do you expect of them, and what do would you want to see?

We are a very long way away from having clean air in Delhi and most parts of North India. Air pollution in cities across the country even the likes of Bombay and Madras are unhealthy (just not as bad as Delhi). 


**But** there is no reason why air pollution data shouldn’t be as easy to access and understand as weather data. I’m working to make that happen for worldwide air pollution data.


I'm the Founder of AirAirAir.org.


**Smokey** is a [friendly air pollution chatbot](http://m.me/smokeybot). that works in Facebook Messenger. Now you can easily monitor the air quality levels in your city effortlessly every day, and learn what you can do about it to protect yourself and your families. You can search for “smokey air” in Facebook Messenger app, or just click on [http://m.me/smokeybot](http://m.me/smokeybot). It's totally free and works like magic for many cities around the world. 


I recorded this short video yesterday to talk briefly about the air pollution in Delhi: https://youtu.be/siF-lZHLeN4  


Prior to this, I launched simple twitter bots:


* [DelhiChokes](http://www.twitter.com/DelhiChokes) - hourly updates to Delhi's air pollution levels on twitter.


* [DelhivsWorld](http://www.twitter.com/DelhivsWorld) - hourly updates to Delhi's air pollution levels on twitter.


I definitely don’t have all the answers, but I want to hear your experiences about air pollution and help in any way I can, especially by democratizing air pollution data in a way that's super easy to access and understand for absolutely everyone with an internet connection. 


**Let’s talk air pollution.**  I have a simple question for you: Do you wear a face mask? Why or Why not?

[AMA] I am a spiritually awakened person from Pune here to offer assistance to troubled souls in these challenging times. Ask Me Anything!,4,8o1tqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8o1tqa/ama_i_am_a_spiritually_awakened_person_from_pune/,111,1527986769.0,"**Please read this before you proceed:** One: Just because I'm spiritually awakened, *does not mean* that I ""know everything"". I'm learning and growing *every day* as much as (if not more than) you or anyone else in here and this learning is meant to be an infinite journey, be it for you or for me or for anyone else. Two: I will try to answer all questions, except for questions to which I quite frankly have *no answers to*. There are plenty of areas within the human experience that I have little to no experience with, and I'll *not* talk about things I don't know jackshit about because hypocrisy/fakery isn't my branch of expertise. Three: And this is the most important thing. Please do not take my words as gospel just because I'm ""woke"" - for what I have to offer is but a different perspective than what you may have considered before. Use your own discernment, logic, intuition and experimentation to see what works for you and what doesn't. Even if you think that I'm a complete fake, all I ask is that you at least read what I have to say with an open mind, take what works for you and trash what doesn't. Because as right or wrong as I could be, no two people have the same paths towards attaining spiritual awakening. So, even if what I have to offer in terms of an advice is appropriate for, say, 10 out of 100 people; there are still always going to be 90 others who will find no relevance in my words. That does not necessarily mean that I'm being a fraudulent cunt, it would just mean that 90 others have different ways of going about things, which is a *perfectly valid thing*.

**Why *Is* AMA?**  

Humanity as a whole is headed towards some pretty fucking challenging times ahead and some truly unpleasant and shattering revelations about the nature of the reality that they are living in. A lot of those challenging situations are already presenting themselves in every way even at personal levels, just look at all of the fear, negativity, sadness and depression in any of the Reddit threads; or anywhere else on the internet for that matter. The internet is just a smaller reflection of the greater reality and planetary consciousness. And then, there are all of these changes that are also now rapidly taking place across people's lives, and will shortly be taking place across national, global and even greater scales than that. All I wish to do here is to assist anyone going through troubled times (who is at least willing to listen to a fresh perspective) because it would honestly be such a waste if I knew all of these cool things and was ultimately unable to help anyone when they truly needed it. Not happening on my watch.  

Thank you for your time.  

**P.S.** Even after this AMA is over, I'll be there to assist any of you who are at all interested in the same through the direct messaging feature. Hope that helps.  

**EDIT 1:** Please keep asking questions even though seeing my replies may take some time; mainly because I tend to write really long-ass replies. I prefer to be really comprehensive about this, hope you'll understand.  

**EDIT 2:** For all those who are interested in knowing more about what happens after death and things such as how ""soul contracts"" that we make prior to incarnation upon this planet work, you are most welcome to visit the [""Exceptional Experiences"" section (link)](http://www.nderf.org/Archives/exceptional.html) of the NDERF (Near Death Experience Research Foundation) experience contribution repository. You'll find it to be extremely fascinating, and get more info than you'd have possibly bargained for.  

**EDIT 3:** For anyone interested in finding out whether they too have Technokinesis abilities like me that I've **[spoken about here \(in point #2\)](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8o1tqa/ama_i_am_a_spiritually_awakened_person_from_pune/e00h8f7/)**, you are more than welcome to visit the **[Fourmilab Retropsychokinesis Experiments page](https://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/experiments/)** and try out the goodies in there for yourselves. I'm pretty sure anyone can do it if they simply focused. Hope this helps.  

**EDIT 4:** To all of the people who only have to mock what I have to say in here and are busy contributing nothing positive to the discussion, I would love to ask, what pleasure does doing so give you? Look through my posts and you'll realise that not only have I been up all night (and right back now that it's morning!) to make sure that every question I've been asked gets answered, but also I've made sure to answer nearly every question (including some of the openly ill-intentioned ones) to their fullest detail wherever I can, even though it has taken me *hours* to do so. And (so far as I can see) I haven't tried to sell or market a single thing to anyone, or as much as mentioned my name. **There have been ""stickied AMAs"" in here that have answered 1% of your (hundreds of) questions in 1 line at best, that too, only to promote some products or agendas or for profits (PC AMA, anyone?).** At least I'm not doing that. At least I'm being sincere about what I have to offer even though my post has gotten such little visibility (due to not being stickied). I'm not asking for your respect here, all I'm asking is that you not deter others who are genuinely interested in asking/answering questions and the pursuit of truth by being so *mean* to them.

My dad works at some sort of government hotel which is mostly used by politicians. So, most of the politicians I meet are arrogant (to some extent) and usually don't talk much (Sushma Swaraj for example). I also met Anna Hazare a couple of years ago and not to mention, he was even more arrogant than politicians.

Anyways, this guy was super cool and friendly.When I approached him, he offered me a firm handshake. He even told me that I have an over-complicated phone unlock pattern (which was true :) ). I wanted to take a selfie but I don't think he likes em so he told his P.A. to take a picture of us. I also told him about reddit and asked him if he could do an AMA here. I told him that many famous people have done AMAs including celebrities and politicians, and damn he threw a bouncer. He asked me to name a few politicians and I couldn't remember name of even one Indian politician who has done an AMA here. So I said I can't recall name of any politician but I told him about the recent AMA of Roy's director and also about other famous AMAs. He said he'll think about it. 

Personally, I believe he's a nice guy and I've always been a fan of him. He's one of the few guys that are responsible for the survival of Congress. I believe we need more young politicians like him.

For the guys who don't know him, from wikipedia:

> Son of a senior politician Rajesh Pilot, he became the youngest Member of Parliament in the country at the age of 26. Pilot was a Member of the Lok Sabha's Standing Committee on Home Affairs and Member of the Consultative Committee in the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

>  In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, he defeated Bharatiya Janata Party's Kiran Maheshwari by a margin of 76,000 votes and won the seat of Ajmer.
