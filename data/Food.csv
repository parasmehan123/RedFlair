He told,

&gt;*I'm going to Cognizant Internship on Weekdays, and on Weekends he's on Delivery duty with Zomato.*

Out of Curiosity, I told him if I could join him on a day in delivery here in Chennai and go on Deliveries with him. Here's a short compiled list of things that I learnt from, and I would like to pen them down for you.

## So, here you go,

* When asked, why did he chose to be a Delivery guy, his answer was pretty much straight saying, "" I was bored in the room and couldn't stay"", so chose this to keep himself busy.
* The next reason that he stated was the amount he was earning, he goes to intern at Cognizant from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, sometimes longer **every day** for a month. But he earns Rs. 12,000 INR but same time spend on this delivery services get him Rs. 40,000 INR per month, depending upon the orders he delivers. Later, when he got busy with Cognizant, he chose to do it on Weekends.
* He was very conscious that Job at Cognizant is secure and scalable down the line in next 3 - 5 years, while working a delivery guy is not.
* He intentionally asked his dad that, to drop him an amount fixed of Rs. 6000 INR in his account. Anything beyond the expenses of Rs. 6000, he would take from his own earned savings.
* He spent the initial amount from his friend, to get a Pre-owned Bike. Which he later turned into his own in 2 weeks of full-day service on Zomato.
* He's very much clear and passionate about doing some business and is definitely on this way. While Job acts something secure for his parents &amp; the society.
* He also has one of his colleague in Zomato who also works Cognizant and earns Rs. 1,50,000 INR per month. But, he joined Zomato along.

## While that was very pretty much about him, and his experience with the delivery goes this way,

* On December 31, 2018, he wasn't actually ready or in a mood to enjoy the new year. Zomato app for Delivery guys was pretty much easy, they just have to **toggle between online/offline.**
* So, he just kept his phone online, and got an Order that late night, and exactly at 12:01 AM he went on to the doorstep to deliver the order.

&gt;*""The customer, took the order, shared me the new year cake &amp; hugged me. Also, showed me so much gratitude.""*

* This guy was special, since he was pretty much familiar with technology than the other uneducated delivery guys, he used to understand the exact address &amp; map locations. The best part was, **he only does doorstep delivery**, no matter it's on 4-5 floor Apartment.
* If the phones go below 20% of charge, the app doesn't work. Once set 'Online', the app takes the complete control over the phone. You cannot turn the phone off or put it in silent mode, soon.
* Sometimes they have classes. They are taught to wear shoes and behave politely.
* Zomato only allows you to become a delivery for one particular Region who you chose to deliver to. You cannot go beyond that.
* All their batch take Group Photos when they wait near a restaurant and have their own WhatsApp group. He's a Batch POC to remaining 22 members of his batch. (Similar to Class Representative in Colleges :P)
* There are few people, who think they'll get more orders to deliver if he waits for nearest to the computer of the manager in the restaurant he's waiting in. That sounds funny, but it is true. More orders are like more marks.

**How do you get an order that has to be delivered on mobile?**

""I need to toggle to Active mode, once that's done as soon as some order is ready for me to get it delivered, the restaurant owner and I will get a screen asking to accept the order. I need to swipe it. Then I have to go to the Restaurant owner to get an OTP and enter in my app. (Which basically says the customer, the Delivery boy has reached the restaurant) Once swiped, Order details will appear to get the food to deliver."" he said.

**Do you know who is the CEO of Zomato is?**

**""I don't know who CEO is, (laughs), but if you ask the same to my colleagues here on service waiting along with others on they don't even know what 'CEO' is!""** *That said, I've asked him an irrelevant question, maybe.*

**Share me one interesting incident that happened with you?**

""Once there was one of us, who took a U-Turn in the wrong direction. It was Delivery boy's mistake. But when police caught him, all the delivery boys in that area joins to please the officer to leave him. The interesting part is, it just takes on WhatsApp message in the group, and all the guys in the batch will turn their **Active status off** and suddenly, no delivery boy will be available to serve customers.""

## Safety

Well that being said, for any delivery guys the biggest nightmare while they go on a delivery is Safety. Of course, I've experienced that part to. We were going calm straight, and suddenly met with an accident.

We were probably lucky enough that we didn't go with any serious injuries, but just a few minor ones.

So here's a picture of the bike that's damaged. - **Removed**

&amp;#x200B;

Looks like something serious happened.

## Finally,

After learning so much from him, here's what I just said what I want to,

*""I really love the values you hold, You are very much conscious and practical about the life and now, you already took action to build it the right way, while there are millions fail pick. I see you also have personal targets to save money and measure your success by the amount of money you make. While that's quite a good practical metric, there's also my last piece of advice for you. Money is only a need &amp; business is what you want to do. Figure out Why you want to do anything you plan for.""*",,arh2rt,,0,,false,1553198576,false,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/cUZzj8Hb0w0KMweNNjnJlhU4Blf8x9RFqSMk6qBE4Ls.jpg,t5_2qh1q,,Food,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/arh2rt/a_day_out_with_zomato_friend_on_delivery/,,,false,Food,

There are no other nutritional benefits of milk as far as my research goes.

Why not replace it with calcium rich sesame seeds?

He proceeds to tell that is is very awesome to eat and tasty. And then asks again did you want to eat again. I said yes. I was fairly clueless so he then acted to bring the curry. And brought a stone and told me that the curry is here. I was confused?? . It was during summer holidays. I was confused the entire summer then I asked my mother what ""Bhata"" is she told me it was stone and loled out. She laughed so much that it became her favourite thing to ask me for several years.

1546849743,india,PitradevSanrashanam,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/adfqfa/cooking_oil_brands_have_started_targeting_stomach/,5,12,,,Cooking Oil brands have started targeting stomach &amp; digestion for advertising their products.,"So for past many years we have been seeing multiple advertisements for cooking oils which targeted heart and other cardiovascular health related concerns for advertising their products. They have shown women deep frying samosas for their husbands in respective brands because they care about their husband's heart. They have shown husbands failing to jog without losing their breath because they started using certain brand of oil and now husband's stamina has multiplied by 3.

&amp;#x200B;

But suddenly, maybe a week or two it seems like cooking oil brands have suddenly shifted from heart to stomach. They have started advertising the well being of stomach to advertise their product. I don't recall the brand, but yes there is one advertise running it. But what caught my attention was one shitty marathi serial on Zee Marathi had product placement for some cooking oil brand with required targeting. 

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize the serial, the leading female protagonist is owner of a company worth Rs. 300CR only while her husband is cheating on her with much younger &amp; beautiful gold digger girl. So this leading lady is cooking in her kitchen with certain brand of oil and her mom-in-law walks in and asks about change in brand. To which the lady goes that this oil keeps stomach healthy and keeps heath problems related to stomach away. \*Insert brand name while facing camera and respective catchphrase\*

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure, other brands making cooking oil must have started producing advertisements targeting stomach and in few weeks our TV programmes will be flooded with them.

but why not food?

I have seen across the web different websites/YouTube channels none of which give Indian Foods at least top 3.  We are below Spain, Japan,china. 

Although these rankings don't hold any strength and are based on personal/experience.
Also each country may think its food is beast but we do deserve more popularity.
We always get moked about us being  street shitter/Customer support. 

I think aleast out food culture deserves a credit. In History it did and we were looted.

On top of my head, our cuisine is

1. Complex and need effort, unlike just putting meat and Tomato between two buns and call it best sandwich.

2. Healthy unlike a pizza with maida.

3. We have the vast diverse cultures and unique flavours.

4. Mouth watering types of sweets and time pass namkeen.

 I do understand each person thinks its own countries food is better/tasty. I'm asking to fight Pancake Vs Dosa, also I'm not fighting against a Pizza. 

What do you guys feel, Do you feel we deserve better?


Edit: Smh, I am aware that each country thinks it is great, they have more varieties and not a about competition.  
Its just the popularity and awareness about the wide range of healthy and tasty dishes we have like.

*I am not asking to rank foods

**again I'm not saying that our desi foods are healthy.

Period. Discussion ends there. You peeps out there got to envy my today's breakfast : The [Revenge of the Upma, now with delicious spinach](https://imgur.com/a/gfo7bOW). I hope you all can recognize the vegetables. Onions are not shown in the pictures, but they are **required**.If not, we should meet in person to discuss the food that you eat on your planet; may be could work out some profitable business.

There are some chopped greens and that is spinach/desi palak. This is NOT the same that you get in west. And I hope you are able to recognize those grains as well - Chick peas ( I wonder what happened to that chick), Kidney beans, Pesalu (in telugu), green peas, and kandulu (in telugu). All of the soaked and to some extent germinated. 

Now it's important to cut the ginger into long sticks. Not chopped into small little slices. When you eat upma, you will need to bite that little piece of ginger and enjoy the taste and slight tingling sensation you feel when ginger juice oozes on to your tongue. That juice when mixed with cocktail of other flavors especially tomato is heavenly to experience. Also onions too,they need to be sliced long.

How to cook? Seriously guys, vegetables know how to blend themselves with each other. Your job is to only put them in right order. So here is the order

1. Heat the oil. If it's not mustard oil, I can recommend roasting some fenugreek seeds.
2. Beans+grains. Now that these have been in preparation for a day (coz that's how you get sprouting beans you numbnuts) 
2. Chili + ginger. At least one of the chilli fellow is gonna explode. That's when you move to next step
3.  Palak. Let it cook for ~ 1 min and then add tomato. They both will blend well and signal you with a very very nice aroma. That's when you move on to the next step
4. Add some water just so that all the ingredients are just drowned and about to cry for help but not yet.
5. Bring that water to boil and now is the time to add long sliced onions. Remember onions have to be half cooked. You need them to taste 50% raw and 50% cooked when that gets tangled with long ginger and you take a bite of it.
6. Now add upma rava, keep stirring the brew while you do. It gets cooked under no time. How do you know its' cooked? It gets hard and you can't stir anymore and you stop.

Now serve yourself this wonderful upma along with some child curd.

EDIT:

To the guy who gave me silver, another recipe exclusively for him. No not for any of the other people out there. Without giving me a silver, don't use the following recipe. And [don't cheat](https://imgur.com/frDBIFC) (naughty, naughty!)

I am going out to our farmer's market (రైతు బజారు)  and buy large brinjals. Buy a cooking brush. You cut LARGE slices of brinjal, paint each of the slices with your favorite oil (mine is coconut) and gently place them in non-stick pan and cover it with lid. Now you are going to make a spicy powder that you are going to sprinkle /spread on those cooked brinjal slices

1. Ingredients:  little moong daal (మినప పప్పు), green gram (in telugu it's called pesalu పెసలు ), ground nut, red chillies, slice of dried coconut (**important**, it gives a very distinct flavor). Optional are dhaniya and jeera seeds
2. Dry fry all of the above
3. Now add some salt+ chopped garlic cloves + a ball of tamarind (dry and **important**)  and grind it to a fine powder

Once your brinjals are cooked, sprinkle the above powder and enjoy as a side dish to anything rice.",,alww22,,0,,false,1552745177,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Food,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/alww22/food_upma_is_the_best_food_for_breakfast/,,,false,Food,

It's not, the slogan, ""Breakfast is the most important meal of the day,"" was invented in the mid 19th century by Seventh Day Adventists James Caleb Jackson and John Harvey Kellogg to sell their newly invented breakfast cereal food stuffs. Yes, that Kellogg. Then the bacon market jumped on that bandwagon, got 5,000 doctors to sign off on the health benefits of eating protein in the morning, and got news papers to publish the signatories as though it were scientific research.

It was all founded on bullshit. It was a weird time, where people were moving into factories and people were getting all up about indigestion. Kellogg was also weird about the morality of breakfast and thought bland food would curb masturbation. If you look into this period, it gets weirder than that. I blame all the lead and mercury in the water. That shit makes you dumb and fucking crazy.

****************

This is obviously highlighting the situation in the West. But how about in India? Did we always have a breakfast culture?

Are zomato/food panda/uber eats like this?,"My experience with Swiggy over the last few months has been pathetic. Horrible, horrible company.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, their 'deals' are usually a scam. Many of their restaurants list their menu prices on Swiggy while calling it a discount. It is their duty as an aggregator to correct this behaviour - which they do nothing about.

&amp;#x200B;

Further, theres a higher than 50% chance I will get the wrong order. 

&amp;#x200B;

My worst experience was when there were numerous items missing from my order and they did not refund or replace but issued a coupon for 1/5th the value of the food. That is called THEFT.

&amp;#x200B;

They claim that 'missing items/wrong items is the restaurants fault'. Hey, idiots, I am paying YOU not the restaurant. It is YOUR FAULT and YOU are responsible.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst is their 'customer support team' aka 'bunch of baboons at a keyboard'.

&amp;#x200B;

All they do is copy paste apologies, saying 'we assure you this will not happen again', and then it ALWAYS happens again.

&amp;#x200B;

Asked how I can speak to a manager, and the last SIX executives I spoke to kept ignoring the question, replying with irrelevant nonsense, then closing the chat.

&amp;#x200B;

This cesspool of a disgusting, charlatan company should be boycotted completely.

&amp;#x200B;

Incidentally, are other food aggregators in our country like this? ",,axipes,,0,,false,1560134261,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Food,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/axipes/swiggy_is_rubbish_are_zomatofood_pandauber_eats/,,,false,Food,

2) verka slim milk : 35.5g protein: 40 rs
3) 3 roti : 11.5g protein : (basically free)
