I am cancelling my connections and I hope what I say in this post are compelling enough for you to support me.","I am copying and pasting from a [comment I made in another thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/adu4hg/indias_massive_jio_carrier_is_blocking_vpn_sites/edkyke4/), after someone suggested that I should make a thread about this.

Jio is using

1. Deep packet inspection
2. Carrier-grade NAT
3. Poorly configured stateful IPv6
4. Almost completely locked down router with some non-sequitor options
5. Clueless customer service, who just say ""we can't talk about X or Y or Z"" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they'll say they can't help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. 

The first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.

To explain in more detail:

1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.
2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.
 * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.
3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven't really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.
 * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.
4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.
5. Jio's customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don't have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won't even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.
 * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!

I will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move.

Most of the routers below Rs.2000 have 100Mbit LAN ports and if you have a fiber connection that's over 100Mbit/sec, it wont be sufficient and you simply have to buy a new router with gigabit ports. When the main internet connection is capped at 100Mbit/sec by such routers, there is no way your true potential of the wireless upgrade will feel useful. Simply put, what is the use if your wired connection ports are slower than the wireless connection in your router.

Let's say you have an expensive network attached storage(NAS). And you have connected your 4k OLED smart TV to your  new AC750 router. You start streaming from your NAS and alas! it lags like it used to before. Its because your LAN ports are capped at 100Mbit/sec. Meanwhile, if the NAS is connected to the router wirelessly, you will get improved speeds.

Unless you are using WAN and LAN ports at the same time,wirelessly , the extra benefit of the wireless won't even reflect in your day to day usage.

I am surprised this hasn't been widely called out. Everyone talks about how these companies advertise ""theoretical"" speeds where they add up Wireless N + Wireless AC and advertise the sum number but i consider the lack of Gigabit ports as even more stupider. Gigabit is the standard today. Bad products such as these are made to exploit naive consumers and stay away from it.

If I am correct, smartphones like [Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro](https://www.latestphonezone.com/xiaomi-redmi-note-pro-reviews-and-specifications/), [Nokia 9](https://www.latestphonezone.com/nokia-9-pureview-price/), [Oppo F11 Pro](https://www.latestphonezone.com/oppo-f11-pro-latest-android-smartphone/), [Samsung Galaxy M30](https://www.latestphonezone.com/samsung-galaxy-m30-reviews-and-features/) were unveiled in India first before other market.

Most of us in far West Africa don't even get to see most of these smartphones unless you order on Amazon. Any reasons for this?

Need a laptop for my dad. He needs it for accounting mainly, plus a little browsing and things like MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint. Preferably Windows, as that particular accounting software works only on Windows.

I'd thought of Surface Go (128GB) but it seemed like an overkill.

#### Instructions

- **DO NOT** watch videos of youtubers talking about Tor. It is highly
likely that they themselves don't know anything about it and are just
reading a blog post written by some idiot on the internet.

- I am linking some videos, websites and you should watch/read them. If
you think there are better resources then comment below, I'll add them.
(link good resources and not someone just reading few blog posts and
talking about it)

#### Quick Q/A

Q: Is Tor illegal?

A: Not in India.

--

Q: Will it harm my computer?

A: Highly unlikely, it is idiot proof (not 100%).

--

Q: I've heard of people's webcams turning on, is that true?

A: Highly unlikely. Probably they were just lying for monies and it is
possible then they can do the same when you visit websites on normal
web.

--

Q: Can I watch porn through Tor?

A: Yes you can but I'd suggest get some free vpn -&gt; watch porn -&gt; delete
it.

--

Q: I don't want to visit bad (nsfl) websites, what should I do?

A: Nothing, just don't go here and there looking for links. 

--

Q: I am not going to donate anything to Tor Project, should I still use
it?

A: Yes, by using Tor you are helping the Tor Project. 

--

Q: What should I route through Tor?

A: Normal text based websites traffic, like reddit's (if you don't
consume too much media). You can ask your application to proxy its
traffic through Tor (if it supports).

--

Q: What should I not route through Tor?

A: There is no such restriction but you should keep in mind that all
those servers are run voluntarily and you should not abuse it. Maybe
don't route heavy files through Tor.

--

Q: Why do you write Tor and not TOR?

A: It's Tor and not TOR.

My parents are supportive of me for doing so, so that wasnt a problem there. 

I have done my research on what pure mathematics consists of (like the topics such as group theory, number theory, etc) and it is definitely something im very interested in. The only problem that i think i have that anyone around me who wants to do the same(very few btw) have been studying for mathematical olympiards and whatnot since 8th grade. Since i realised this in 12th I have had no time to study for rmo or look into any of it thoroughly, but it does seem challenging.

1550788561,india,nibirujiii,self.india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/at9hy3/digital_colonisation_the_fight_for_indias_soul/,4,3,,,"Digital Colonisation: the fight for India's soul, and for the rest of the world, begins with individual privacy online. It's time to fight back against Silicon Valley. But... how?","Next to Aadhaar, Facebook may be the greatest modern threat against privacy. How do we fight back and keep Facebook from colonising India?

&gt; ""The business model of the internet is surveillance. We build systems that spy on people in exchange for services. [Corporations call it marketing.](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/surveillance_is_the.html)""

Have you noticed? Whenever someone says ""you're being **too political**"", it usually means ""you've mentioned a group of people I don't care about"".

Or **they gaslight you** -- saying you're ""crazy"" for not being white, male, straight, or ""American"" enough. If you dare to notice the discrimination built into their systems, they try to distract from the issue by **attacking you as a person**, trying to force you to jump through endless hoops of arbitrarily defined ""moral purity"".

**This is the typical response on Reddit.** Silicon Valley's social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) was built by them, for them. ""Them"" means entitled middle-class white males. More specifically: _middle-class, white, aged between 18 and 49, male, cisgender, heterosexual, and mostly American_ males. They built social media for themselves and their friends. The rest of us are unwelcome guests in their safe space.

# **Free Speech versus Diversity?**

This is why the rest of us (non-white, women, LGBT, and others) are treated so badly on their systems. They refuse to ban racist, or violent misogyny and homophobia because it would hurt ""free speech"". Their persecution anxiety leads their bigotry behind slogans like ""diversity is the problem"", ""don't shove _your diversity_ in my face"". George Orwell would be proud (or horrified) to see such twisting of words in service of harmfully bad ideas.

&gt; Here's an analogy: nuclear power can be used to power entire cities and give millions of people energy for centuries, or destroy cities and commit genocide in the blink of an eye. Should we allow the secrets and materials for nuclear to proliferate everywhere, because it's ""just science"" and ""knowledge wants to be free""? Of course not.
&gt; 
&gt; Should we allow bigotry and hatred to rule on social media because it's ""just speech"" and ""information wants to be free""? Of course not.

Now you see the bigotry hidden in Silicon Valley talk about ""free speech"". It's free for them, and the costs are left for us to bear. This is the same as patterns of colonisation throughout the history of Western civilisation. History has begun to repeat itself on the internet.

In other words, they have no grasp of basic morality for anyone who isn't like them. And as you'll see here, that means people in India, Brasil and around the world are now starting to die.

---

## **Aadhaar's Failure is Facebook's Success**

The question here begins with privacy.

Aadhaar is well-known for allowing unauthorised access to [private information of millions of India's citizens](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aadhaar-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/story-VhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wO.html). People are concerned, are rightfully so.

In the case of Facebook, selling your privacy to the highest bidder is the entire profit model. That's why Facebook is ""free"". It's as if Aadhaar's privacy-destroying mistakes are Facebook's business plan.

For India, a country where [69% of citizens live in rural areas](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS), this means that over 300 million people (those who have smartphones) are at risk. And unlike the Indian government's dependence on the will of the people, Facebook is completely unaccountable to anyone but their company shareholders.

# **Facebook's Plan to Colonise India**

Starting in 2014, [Facebook tried to give away free Internet to rural India](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-india-doesnt-want-free-basics). The bargain was simple: if you use internet through Facebook, we give it to you for free. That really means, ""if you allow us to watch, record and sell data about every move you make online, we'll give you access to a limited amount of internet for no cost.""

Thankfully, India's regulators eventually said no, and in 2016, the Free Basics program was stopped.

## **Facebook and Bollywood**

If you've watched any Bollywood films over the past few years, there are two names you'll see and hear all the time. You can probably guess. No, it's not SRK or Deepika Padukone. Also not Salman Khan or Katrina Kaif.

The two names are Facebook and WhatsApp.

Again in rural India, WhatsApp has been involved in [an increasing number of murders](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2017/12/deadly-rumours-india-whatsapp-dilemma-171216091928319.html). The culprit is rumours and intentional misinformation that spread via Facebook's messaging service (WhatsApp).

Even though Facebook's attempts to colonise India are blatant (the Free Basics program) and have led to several deaths (WhatsApp), they are still making more efforts.

Instead of regulators, they are trying to convince citizens that Facebook is good by having celebrities constantly use the service in Bollywood films.

You may not have known this, but Instagram and WhatsApp are owned by Facebook. Now think of how many times you've seen films where the real stars in the background are social media accounts on someone's smartphone. (There's even a Reddit community [specifically for Indian people praising Facebook...!](https://np.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/))

# **Democracy, Immigration, Misinformation and Disinformation**

Now think about how easily democracy has been subverted in places like the United States, Britain and Brasil. In the U.S., the Trump campaign openly acknowledged targeting [millions of young women and black voters through Facebook](http://fortune.com/2016/10/30/trump-voter-supression-operations/) to suppress their votes, since they tend to vote Democrat (not Republican; Trump is a Republican). In the case of Brexit, [hundreds of fake Twitter accounts also spread disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/how-400-russia-run-fake-accounts-posted-bogus-brexit-tweets).

As more children and adults in mass detainment centres, the American immigration service (ICE) is [using users' private Facebook data to target and hunt down immigrants](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-facebook-data-track-immigrants).

# **To prevent colonisation of our digital lives, we must fight back for our right to privacy.**

So how can we fight against amoral companies like Facebook (with WhatsApp and Instagram) and Twitter?

We now know that [""free"" access via Internet advertising is just another word for intrusive surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/24/deep-surveillance-is-price-of-a-free-web-advertising). We know that in rural India, where many are less educated, people are dying because of misinformation spread through social media. And we know since 2016, that as long as Facebook and Silicon Valley can get away with it, they don't care.

There needs to be an alternative, and it needs to come from the people who are most affected. Not another Facebook, Orkut, Reddit or Twitter, created by white men, for white men -- and if anyone else wants to join, they'd better not be too ""political"". The web is run by narcissists and bullies now, and there has to be a better way.

I'm working with a project that is creating a new social network, but if this post inspires you to start something for India and the rest of the world, I'd be glad to work with you, too. And if you're just hearing some of these facts for the first time, it's okay to be angry. Get angry enough to do something right now. The stakes are too high now to just shrug, turn away and take another selfie: if we let Silicon Valley take our privacy away, they will never give it back.",,at9hy3,,0,,false,1553234273,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Science Technology,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/at9hy3/digital_colonisation_the_fight_for_indias_soul/,,,false,Science/Technology,

I have been seeing a lot of posts about privacy and [using VPNs](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/af54p8/techies_of_randia_how_to_create_own_private_vpn/) and I figured I should offer some perspective about this topic.  I have been using VPNs even though I have a secure network mainly because port 22(SSH) is blocked by my ISP and therefore I have to use a VPN to do SSH.

&amp;#x200B;

**SETTING UP**

The first step is to make a free cloud account on any of common cloud service providers like AWS, Google Cloud or Azure. They offer a one year free tier usage policy on a VM that could be used for the whole year without any charges incurred.

After making a base VM you can follow the tutorial [on this link](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/How_to_SSH_into_a_server_that_is_outside_the_campus_network)  to set up SSH tunneling. After the whole tutorial works you can do  `sshuttle --dns -r myserver`  [`0.0.0.0/0`](https://0.0.0.0/0) `-vv` and that will help you route all your traffic through the VM.

This means that if you are a college student behind a proxy and blocked websites then you can access all the blocked websites/content like steam/whatsapp/telegram etc.  As for all the rest of the users this acts like a good VPN that routes all your traffic through the VM and offers security.",,afe5zt,,0,,false,1552634914,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Science Technology,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/afe5zt/setting_up_free_vpns_on_your_own_serverand/,,,false,Science/Technology,

I had signed up for it on a throwaway email account 4 years ago, and just last month I deleted the account for reasons listed below:
- I was afraid there won't be a way to change my Country on the account (previously I had tried changing from US to UK but there was no option to do so)
- I wanted to switch it to my personal email account
- I wanted to start afresh because my Recommendations were all fucked

When Spotify got released a few days ago, I immediately registered using my personal email and was ready to buy Premium as well. After signing up I noticed my username was not what I entered while registering but a combination of letters and numbers.

I think whatsapp needs a corporate sharing capability of some sort. Similar to Snapchat sending messages on holidays and birthdays. That's the only way they can educate their users on 1) how to figure out fake stories vs real news and 2) how to prevent scams. 

Maybe some sort of message reporting feature would be nice. So if a fake forward is going around the country, people can report it as fake and then whatsapp will tag the message as ""might be spam"" or something like that. Or maybe a bot can run to check when a picture or block of text is shared to show when the image was first shared. 

Now of course end-to-end encryption is a hastle in this. So maybe there's an option where you can select a message ""Fact Check"" it. So it'll simply copy-paste the text to google or reverse image search which will most probably open up a news source debunking or proving it.

I am a computer science student currently pursuing B. Tech. Today I got to know about the ongoing sale on Durgasoft online courses. 

I was interested in purchasing several courses from there but they end up exceeding my budget. As it is the last day of the sale, I desperately want to buy them.

Is there anyone here who would want to share these courses along with me? We can buy them together if it is possible.

The course material I am interested in are : 

1. Python by Durga sir.

2. Spring Core by Ramesh Sir.

3. Spring Advanced by Ramesh Sir.

3. Hibernate by Ramesh Sir.

4. and Web Services by Ramesh Sir.


Is there any other way I can get these courses for less value. Right now they are available at 50% off with an effective price of INR 4720 each.

Are there any other online courses better than Durgasoft? 

Please help me out here. Any sort of advice regarding this would be appreciated. ",,b42za6,,0,,false,1560251418,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Science Technology,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b42za6/looking_for_a_partner_to_buy_durgasoft_online/,,,false,Science/Technology,

In my few days time with it and the research before that, I think  it is quite safe and definitely legit because when it is mining bitcoins, CPU usage goes as high as 90% but it doesn't slow down my pc either. It just slows down the mining process by reducing the CPU usage to about 30-40% when it detects some other program requires to use the CPU. I can even set the mining speed depending on how much I want it consume of my CPU power. You can get this browser too and start mining bitcoins today :- [https://get.cryptobrowser.site/5157331](https://get.cryptobrowser.site/5157331) . It is supported on both Windows and MacOS.

Currently I am pursuing PhD in information technology. However, my work is progressing toward neuroscience (which I found as my energy converging point). Currently, I am studying emotions. Due to IT background, I am pretty well with the coding skills and applying it for customised high end GPU based calculations on voxel wise activity given some task. Although, I always have this feeling of lack of sufficient knowledge in the field of neuroscience. Although, I am trying my best to learn as much as possible but missing a disciplinary thinking while facing a complex puzzle. Although, I find myself studying about the neuroscience stuff without any sense of exhaustion, a leap step is needed to get deeply indulged in this exciting and important domain.

As it is a transition period for me where I need to use my relatively more developed computational skills to get the sense and pleasure of getting new in-depth knowledge of the field of brain science. I am seeking for the suitable guideline which can give me a better chance to grab the domain knowledge during this transition and lead me towards disciplinary thinking over more complex problems. I am interested in further studying emotions and related disorders. The guidelines during the PhD and after the PhD both are very much needed and highly appreciated.

Price-wise, printer and ink costs are almost same. 3rd party inks are cheap af.

Had some questions - - 

If anyone has ink tank printers, can you recommend one? Also saw reviews about epson acting weird after some months (like resetting problem). Is it true?

Using 3rd party inks is safe? I'm not worried about quality as I will be mostly using it to print texts.

I told him over phone to log out of the app when I got home. He said he would but I am not sure if he did. Which is why I changed the password on my laptop through chrome browser. I wanted to double check so when I saw my amazon app in my phone, the app was still logged in.

So it seems like if you change passwords, you cannot log out of the app automatically. It just prompts you to put passwords again only if you log back out. But it threw me out on my PC where it was supposed to be kept signed in through Firefox app.

I am not sure what a person is supposed to do if their phone gets stolen? How in the holy world is this app supposed to protect our privacy?Fortunately there are no linked cards or anything on my account. And the only details it has are my email-id and few old addresses with my phone number. That friend is not so close to me so I cannot just go back to him to ask for his phone just because I have doubts. I think everyone should be aware of this.  


UPDATE - It took the app more than 40 minutes to throw me out after the password was changed. For those 40 minutes I had complete access to a fully functional account. I have uninstalled the app after finding this out.

I'm looking to study Masters in CS preferably a course with AI. The caveat is that I screwed up my GATE exam but I still want to go to a good school without giving up a year. I've 7+ years (since 10th grade) of working experience with web technologies and RedHat systems.

So I've researched and found the exams I'm still eligible for which are:

ISI

PGECET (Telangana State Exam, JNTU, OU)

IIITH (PGEE)

BITS HD

Please suggest any other exams that I could write or if there is any other option I can approach. I've heard that NIT has DASA so I may be eligible with GRE but I don't think there's a lot of time left to prepare for that but if you're aware of any similar options, please let me know. I may be eligible for those types of admission procedures I've come to India only for my UG and PG.

I never bothered to get into Television cable things but it was really annoying paying 250 rs per month so I contacted the cable guy during this TRAI transition. To my surprise, the FTA channels where around 130 rs+ tax I was like wait ""aren't these the same channels which you can literally get for free by installing cheap DTH on your home :/ "" 

           You might say well there are convenience and maintenance charges you can't just give 30 rs to keep the connection at your place for 3 chosen channels. Considering the channels I thought we should keep it was really costly so

            I bought an android box for my tv and it's the best purchase I ever made for my family. Every mainstream channel has an app created by their broadcasters like voot, hotstar, sony liv and they put all episodes a day after the live telecast. 

            Now you may say the Internet is not cheap here and its not as reliable as cable tv :/ So my friend just so you know I also belong to a small city where most affordable internet plans cost around 1000rs for just 2-3 mbps per month which is the reason why I use my old 3G dongle connected to my android tv box which gives around 10mbps. There are few lags here and there but it's really great considering how my family now watches fewer tv channels shows, more YouTube videos and other online quality content. I am really happy to see them using the internet as they don't understand English much :) Mom watches a few cooking shows etc and dad watch online news from subscribed channels which are anytime better than tv. Yes, foul languages content is blocked and they check for age rating on prime video and Netflix.

There are certain things you may want to watch live like sports matches, finale shows for which I don't have any legal solution, you can find some workaround online or request providers to let you pay just for 1 channel online and I am sure they will come up with something if more people prefer to use IPTV over traditional now overprice cable tv. 

I really wish the HD upgrade we had a few years ago would be less about set-top box and more about coaxial cable which provides tv channels and internet(they could just enable/disable internet depending on the users)

P.S **I am looking for online family friendly content, need suggestions please.** Thanks to the guy who suggested ""yeh meri family"" few days ago :)",,ak3yys,,0,,false,1552714578,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Science Technology,null,false,true,,/r/india/comments/ak3yys/sort_of_a_solution_for_indian_cable_tv_problem/,,o na kar maan rupaye vaala baar baar ke na rajje,false,Science/Technology,

I could offer a 1-year guarantee or something and if any of the parts fail, I could just ask Amazon or wherever I got the parts for a replacement.

If you don't know about [Dissent Doe](https://twitter.com/PogoWasRight) you ought to follow her right away. She's 
been [voicing](https://www.databreaches.net/) security, and privacy concerns for a while now. 

Sometime last year, a security researcher contacted her about **Schoolcountry**'s website leaking 
thousands of students' personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, right down to grades.

She wrote to SchoolCountry on August 5, then again on August 10, without any tangible response. 
Or, action. She tried again on December 30, only to get back an autoresponse, and reported the whole
ordeal.[¹][a] 

We had been in touch with her around December, working on another breach[²][b], when she
asked us to help out. So, we did. This is how it went.

# Epilogue

Afte the server was taken down, Dissent wrote about it, and raised a few pertinent
questions[³][c]:
 ""But how many IP addresses accessed those files while they were exposed? 
  The data would be valuable for spamming or phishing parents of students or 
  social engineering.""
  
If you are reading this ask SchoolCountry to fix it **NOW**. If you need reasons --
there are **7000** of them.

What about the IPv6 rollout?,"I know it's a dumb question, but I heard that a while back ACT actually assigned Public IPs to all customers but of course due to the sheer increase in the number of internet users almost no one with a normal dynamic subscription gets a Public IP anymore. I am working on some projects and I really needed a Public IP but their static IP rates are a bit higher than I can currently afford.

Another thread long ago mentioned that ACT was switching over to IPv6 (they had already started here in Bengaluru) but I still don't find it. Do you guys know any other ISP that has already implemented IPv6 (or at least assigns a Public IP)?

To clear few things these are  my first wireless headphones. Now after using them for a week.

* The Range is okay not great not too awesome. 
* One Plus 6 shows me the battery status, the 6T would too but not sure about other devices.
* Pairing with other devices is super easy.
* No NFC
* Battery life is 5-6 hours never more than this.
* the audio is sync with video (or plain and simple No Lags)
* Charging is indeed fast 30-40 minutes for a full charge
* Call Quality is good, microphone is good
* I sweat a lot and so far the type C port seems to be holding up fine
* Audio Quality is frankly a bit overhyped. Wired Sennheiser ear phones that cost less than 2k will beat these on any day, again I don't know how other offering are at this range but people saying you got more than what you paid for seems like a crap claim. I have used the Samsung LevelU on a few occasions and the Audio Quality if you're using any device apart from One Plus or devices with aptX then the audio is not really that different, bullets wireless sounds better but again not like mind-blowingly better. Samsung LevelU has the ""hey seems like you're far away from the phone"" complaint  but so far people have not given me that complaint during my calls with bullet wireless.
* A few ear tips/buds provided spend time seeing which one is best. The default one gave a weird sound when the fan was running at full speed(I know weird). Audio Quality changed quit a lot with ear bud change.
* Some lag in PUBG not a huge dealy but still you can tell the difference with wired and these.

The reason I am writing this review is because many people want to buy wireless but I think you should really consider what your priorities are...

If Music Quality Gaming experience matter than sticking to good old wired is the best decision.

or may be go for something like the Sennheiser BT 4.40 which costs more but also has AUX Cable option that might come in handy when your gaming and every micro second counts :P

&amp;#x200B;

I know phone manufacturers are going all fuck headed about this but the choice of good wireless earphones is really slim.

A few cities have experience stores, always give the Sony/Sennheiser/Samsung etc wireless ear phone you are going to buy a trial. 

Buying purely based on reviews may not be such a good decision. 

No point spending 4k or 5k and ending up with a product that is not meeting your expectations",,b70nan,,0,,false,1560305089,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Science Technology,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/b70nan/one_plus_bullet_wireless_my_thoughts/,,,false,Science/Technology,

My sim is not even active currently as i did not recharge it, so i cannot receive any calls but i still can receive texts. What should i do? I do have a bank account which my father handles as i m just 16 and that’s why i m worried about the paisabazaar otp I received. I know nobody can login if they don’t have the otp, but by any chance can i know who’s behind all this? Should i take any precautionary measures?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a final year CSE student from a tier-1 college, and have offer of a good paying job (13lpa base) in a product-based company (US-based), as well as one in a startup with nearly the same salary.

Going through the reviews about people ranting about the monotonous life in software industry and people hitting upper cap by the time they hit their 30s. The only way they break the ceiling is by getting into managerial role, for which many get into MBA, or switch roles.

Also, I have heard/read about most well paying jobs in India being given by American companies, leading to much hierarchies and layers of management suffocating the employees. But yeah, one can definitely get what they want and contribute to the company.

I love developing software products, building stuff, automating and tooling stuff, work on backend and infra, and have interned at some good startups. I love software. Not much interested in higher studies, and I value hands-on experience above academics.

* However, I am a bit concerned if I should really consider being a software developer for long time in companies like Microsoft, Goldman, or good indian startups like Oyo, Ola, Dunzo etc.
* Should I make sure I prepare for CAT to get an MBA and avoid hitting the ceiling early enough?
* How can one avoid stagnating in the industry, making sure you move up the ladder and work remains as exciting as it is in the early phase of your career.",,agjvgn,,0,,false,1552654506,false,self,t5_2qh1q,,Science Technology,,false,true,,/r/india/comments/agjvgn/software_devs_in_productbased_companies_are_you/,,,false,Science/Technology,

I think this will help us all in knowing what the industry standard for a particular position is and if we are getting underpaid at our current job. **The bottom line is to negotiate for higher salaries based on the industry  standard**

**Post in the following format:**

* Name of the Company:

* Job Title or Position:

* Years of Experience (0 for intern): 

* Field or Department: 

* Base Salary:

* Bonus (if any):

------

1. Do not fill out company name if you're from a small company e.g. 75 people or less. This is to prevent doxxing. This was included for entrants of bigger tech companies.

2. If you are based out of India, than **do not** convert the figure to INR
